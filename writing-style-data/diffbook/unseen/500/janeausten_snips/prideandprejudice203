town
the
next
morning.
He
did
not
judge
your
father
to
be
a
person
whom
he
could
so
properly
consult
as
your
uncle,
and
therefore
readily
postponed
seeing
him
till
after
the
departure
of
the
former.
He
did
not
leave
his
name,
and
till
the
next
day
it
was
only
known
that
a
gentleman
had
called
on
business.
"On
Saturday
he
came
again.
Your
father
was
gone,
your
uncle
at
home,
and,
as
I
said
before,
they
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
together.
"They
met
again
on
Sunday,
and
then
I
saw
him
too.
It
was
not
all
settled
before
Monday:
as
soon
as
it
was,
the
express
was
sent
off
to
Longbourn.
But
our
visitor
was
very
obstinate.
I
fancy,
Lizzy,
that
obstinacy
is
the
real
defect
of
his
character,
after
all.
He
has
been
accused
of
many
faults
at
different
times,
but
this
is
the
true
one.
Nothing
was
to
be
done
that
he
did
not
do
himself;
though
I
am
sure
(and
I
do
not
speak
it
to
be
thanked,
therefore
say
nothing
about
it),
your
uncle
would
most
readily
have
settled
the
whole.
"They
battled
it
together
for
a
long
time,
which
was
more
than
either
the
gentleman
or
lady
concerned
in
it
deserved.
But
at
last
your
uncle
was
forced
to
yield,
and
instead
of
being
allowed
to
be
of
use
to
his
niece,
was
forced
to
put
up
with
only
having
the
probable
credit
of
it,
which
went
sorely
against
the
grain;
and
I
really
believe
your
letter
this
morning
gave
him
great
pleasure,
because
it
required
an
explanation
that
would
rob
him
of
his
borrowed
feathers,
and
give
the
praise
where
it
was
due.
But,
Lizzy,
this
must
go
no
farther
than
yourself,
or
Jane
at
most.
"You
know
pretty
well,
I
suppose,
what
has
been
done
for
the
young
people.
His
debts
are
to
be
paid,
amounting,
I
believe,
to
considerably
more
than
a
thousand
pounds,
another
thousand
in
addition
to
her
own
settled
upon
her,
and
his
commission
purchased.
The
reason
why
all
this
was
to
be
done
by
him
alone,
was
such
as
I
have
given
above.
It
was
owing
to
him,
to
his
reserve
and
want
of
proper
consideration,
that
Wickham's
character
had
been
so
misunderstood,
and
consequently
that
he
had
been
received
and
noticed
as
he
was.
Perhaps
there
was
some
truth
in
this;
though
I
doubt
whether
his
reserve,
or
anybody's
reserve,
can
be
answerable
for
the
event.
But
in
spite
of
all
this
fine
talking,
my
dear
Lizzy,
you
may
rest
perfectly
assured
that
your
uncle
would
never
have
yielded,
if
we
had
not
given
him
credit
for
another
interest
in
the
affair.
"When
all
this
was
resolved
on,
he
returned
again
to
his
friends,
who
were
still
staying
at
Pemberley;
but
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
be
in
London
once
more
when
the
wedding
took
place,
and
all
money
matters
were
then
to
receive
the
last
finish.
"I
believe
I
have
now
told
