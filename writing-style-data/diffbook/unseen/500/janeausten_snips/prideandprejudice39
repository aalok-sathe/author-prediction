in
his
letter,
which
promises
well.
I
am
impatient
to
see
him."
"In
point
of
composition,"
said
Mary,
"the
letter
does
not
seem
defective.
The
idea
of
the
olive
branch
perhaps
is
not
wholly
new,
yet
I
think
it
is
well
expressed."
To
Catherine
and
Lydia,
neither
the
letter
nor
its
writer
were
in
any
degree
interesting.
It
was
next
to
impossible
that
their
cousin
should
come
in
a
scarlet
coat,
and
it
was
now
some
weeks
since
they
had
received
pleasure
from
the
society
of
a
man
in
any
other
colour.
As
for
their
mother,
Mr.
Collins's
letter
had
done
away
much
of
her
ill
will,
and
she
was
preparing
to
see
him
with
a
degree
of
composure
which
astonished
her
husband
and
daughters.
Mr.
Collins
was
punctual
to
his
time,
and
was
received
with
great
politeness
by
the
whole
family.
Mr.
Bennet
indeed
said
little;
but
the
ladies
were
ready
enough
to
talk,
and
Mr.
Collins
seemed
neither
in
need
of
encouragement,
nor
inclined
to
be
silent
himself.
He
was
a
tall,
heavy
looking
young
man
of
five
and
twenty.
His
air
was
grave
and
stately,
and
his
manners
were
very
formal.
He
had
not
been
long
seated
before
he
complimented
Mrs.
Bennet
on
having
so
fine
a
family
of
daughters;
said
he
had
heard
much
of
their
beauty,
but
that
in
this
instance
fame
had
fallen
short
of
the
truth;
and
added,
that
he
did
not
doubt
her
seeing
them
all
in
due
time
disposed
of
in
marriage.
This
gallantry
was
not
much
to
the
taste
of
some
of
his
hearers;
but
Mrs.
Bennet,
who
quarreled
with
no
compliments,
answered
most
readily.
"You
are
very
kind,
I
am
sure;
and
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
may
prove
so,
for
else
they
will
be
destitute
enough.
Things
are
settled
so
oddly."
"You
allude,
perhaps,
to
the
entail
of
this
estate."
"Ah!
sir,
I
do
indeed.
It
is
a
grievous
affair
to
my
poor
girls,
you
must
confess.
Not
that
I
mean
to
find
fault
with
you,
for
such
things
I
know
are
all
chance
in
this
world.
There
is
no
knowing
how
estates
will
go
when
once
they
come
to
be
entailed."
"I
am
very
sensible,
madam,
of
the
hardship
to
my
fair
cousins,
and
could
say
much
on
the
subject,
but
that
I
am
cautious
of
appearing
forward
and
precipitate.
But
I
can
assure
the
young
ladies
that
I
come
prepared
to
admire
them.
At
present
I
will
not
say
more;
but,
perhaps,
when
we
are
better
acquainted
"
He
was
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
dinner;
and
the
girls
smiled
on
each
other.
They
were
not
the
only
objects
of
Mr.
Collins's
admiration.
The
hall,
the
dining
room,
and
all
its
furniture,
were
examined
and
praised;
and
his
commendation
of
everything
would
have
touched
Mrs.
Bennet's
heart,
but
for
the
mortifying
supposition
of
his
viewing
it
all
as
his
own
future
property.
The
dinner
too
in
its
turn
was
highly
admired;
and
he
begged
