all
the
morning;
first
one
thing,
then
another,
there
is
no
saying
what,
you
know.
At
one
time
Patty
came
to
say
she
thought
the
kitchen
chimney
wanted
sweeping.
Oh,
said
I,
Patty
do
not
come
with
your
bad
news
to
me.
Here
is
the
rivet
of
your
mistress's
spectacles
out.
Then
the
baked
apples
came
home,
Mrs.
Wallis
sent
them
by
her
boy;
they
are
extremely
civil
and
obliging
to
us,
the
Wallises,
always
I
have
heard
some
people
say
that
Mrs.
Wallis
can
be
uncivil
and
give
a
very
rude
answer,
but
we
have
never
known
any
thing
but
the
greatest
attention
from
them.
And
it
cannot
be
for
the
value
of
our
custom
now,
for
what
is
our
consumption
of
bread,
you
know?
Only
three
of
us.
besides
dear
Jane
at
present
and
she
really
eats
nothing
makes
such
a
shocking
breakfast,
you
would
be
quite
frightened
if
you
saw
it.
I
dare
not
let
my
mother
know
how
little
she
eats
so
I
say
one
thing
and
then
I
say
another,
and
it
passes
off.
But
about
the
middle
of
the
day
she
gets
hungry,
and
there
is
nothing
she
likes
so
well
as
these
baked
apples,
and
they
are
extremely
wholesome,
for
I
took
the
opportunity
the
other
day
of
asking
Mr.
Perry;
I
happened
to
meet
him
in
the
street.
Not
that
I
had
any
doubt
before
I
have
so
often
heard
Mr.
Woodhouse
recommend
a
baked
apple.
I
believe
it
is
the
only
way
that
Mr.
Woodhouse
thinks
the
fruit
thoroughly
wholesome.
We
have
apple
dumplings,
however,
very
often.
Patty
makes
an
excellent
apple
dumpling.
Well,
Mrs.
Weston,
you
have
prevailed,
I
hope,
and
these
ladies
will
oblige
us."
Emma
would
be
"very
happy
to
wait
on
Mrs.
Bates,
&c.,"
and
they
did
at
last
move
out
of
the
shop,
with
no
farther
delay
from
Miss
Bates
than,
"How
do
you
do,
Mrs.
Ford?
I
beg
your
pardon.
I
did
not
see
you
before.
I
hear
you
have
a
charming
collection
of
new
ribbons
from
town.
Jane
came
back
delighted
yesterday.
Thank
ye,
the
gloves
do
very
well
only
a
little
too
large
about
the
wrist;
but
Jane
is
taking
them
in."
"What
was
I
talking
of?"
said
she,
beginning
again
when
they
were
all
in
the
street.
Emma
wondered
on
what,
of
all
the
medley,
she
would
fix.
"I
declare
I
cannot
recollect
what
I
was
talking
of.
Oh!
my
mother's
spectacles.
So
very
obliging
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill!
'Oh!'
said
he,
'I
do
think
I
can
fasten
the
rivet;
I
like
a
job
of
this
kind
excessively.'
Which
you
know
shewed
him
to
be
so
very....
Indeed
I
must
say
that,
much
as
I
had
heard
of
him
before
and
much
as
I
had
expected,
he
very
far
exceeds
any
thing....
I
do
congratulate
you,
Mrs.
Weston,
most
warmly.
He
seems
every
thing
the
fondest
parent
could....
'Oh!'
said
he,
'I
can
fasten
the
rivet.
I
like
a
job
of
that
