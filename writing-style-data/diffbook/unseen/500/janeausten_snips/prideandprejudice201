without
a
confidante.
Elizabeth
had
the
satisfaction
of
receiving
an
answer
to
her
letter
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could.
She
was
no
sooner
in
possession
of
it
than,
hurrying
into
the
little
copse,
where
she
was
least
likely
to
be
interrupted,
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
and
prepared
to
be
happy;
for
the
length
of
the
letter
convinced
her
that
it
did
not
contain
a
denial.
"Gracechurch
street,
Sept.
6.
"MY
DEAR
NIECE,
"I
have
just
received
your
letter,
and
shall
devote
this
whole
morning
to
answering
it,
as
I
foresee
that
a
little
writing
will
not
comprise
what
I
have
to
tell
you.
I
must
confess
myself
surprised
by
your
application;
I
did
not
expect
it
from
you.
Don't
think
me
angry,
however,
for
I
only
mean
to
let
you
know
that
I
had
not
imagined
such
inquiries
to
be
necessary
on
your
side.
If
you
do
not
choose
to
understand
me,
forgive
my
impertinence.
Your
uncle
is
as
much
surprised
as
I
am
and
nothing
but
the
belief
of
your
being
a
party
concerned
would
have
allowed
him
to
act
as
he
has
done.
But
if
you
are
really
innocent
and
ignorant,
I
must
be
more
explicit.
"On
the
very
day
of
my
coming
home
from
Longbourn,
your
uncle
had
a
most
unexpected
visitor.
Mr.
Darcy
called,
and
was
shut
up
with
him
several
hours.
It
was
all
over
before
I
arrived;
so
my
curiosity
was
not
so
dreadfully
racked
as
yours
seems
to
have
been.
He
came
to
tell
Mr.
Gardiner
that
he
had
found
out
where
your
sister
and
Mr.
Wickham
were,
and
that
he
had
seen
and
talked
with
them
both;
Wickham
repeatedly,
Lydia
once.
From
what
I
can
collect,
he
left
Derbyshire
only
one
day
after
ourselves,
and
came
to
town
with
the
resolution
of
hunting
for
them.
The
motive
professed
was
his
conviction
of
its
being
owing
to
himself
that
Wickham's
worthlessness
had
not
been
so
well
known
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
any
young
woman
of
character
to
love
or
confide
in
him.
He
generously
imputed
the
whole
to
his
mistaken
pride,
and
confessed
that
he
had
before
thought
it
beneath
him
to
lay
his
private
actions
open
to
the
world.
His
character
was
to
speak
for
itself.
He
called
it,
therefore,
his
duty
to
step
forward,
and
endeavour
to
remedy
an
evil
which
had
been
brought
on
by
himself.
If
he
had
another
motive,
I
am
sure
it
would
never
disgrace
him.
He
had
been
some
days
in
town,
before
he
was
able
to
discover
them;
but
he
had
something
to
direct
his
search,
which
was
more
than
we
had;
and
the
consciousness
of
this
was
another
reason
for
his
resolving
to
follow
us.
"There
is
a
lady,
it
seems,
a
Mrs.
Younge,
who
was
some
time
ago
governess
to
Miss
Darcy,
and
was
dismissed
from
her
charge
on
some
cause
of
disapprobation,
though
he
did
not
say
what.
She
then
took
a
large
house
in
