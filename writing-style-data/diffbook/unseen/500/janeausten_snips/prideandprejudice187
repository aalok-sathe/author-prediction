of
his
usual
philosophic
composure.
He
said
as
little
as
he
had
ever
been
in
the
habit
of
saying;
made
no
mention
of
the
business
that
had
taken
him
away,
and
it
was
some
time
before
his
daughters
had
courage
to
speak
of
it.
It
was
not
till
the
afternoon,
when
he
had
joined
them
at
tea,
that
Elizabeth
ventured
to
introduce
the
subject;
and
then,
on
her
briefly
expressing
her
sorrow
for
what
he
must
have
endured,
he
replied,
"Say
nothing
of
that.
Who
should
suffer
but
myself?
It
has
been
my
own
doing,
and
I
ought
to
feel
it."
"You
must
not
be
too
severe
upon
yourself,"
replied
Elizabeth.
"You
may
well
warn
me
against
such
an
evil.
Human
nature
is
so
prone
to
fall
into
it!
No,
Lizzy,
let
me
once
in
my
life
feel
how
much
I
have
been
to
blame.
I
am
not
afraid
of
being
overpowered
by
the
impression.
It
will
pass
away
soon
enough."
"Do
you
suppose
them
to
be
in
London?"
"Yes;
where
else
can
they
be
so
well
concealed?"
"And
Lydia
used
to
want
to
go
to
London,"
added
Kitty.
"She
is
happy
then,"
said
her
father
drily;
"and
her
residence
there
will
probably
be
of
some
duration."
Then
after
a
short
silence
he
continued:
"Lizzy,
I
bear
you
no
ill
will
for
being
justified
in
your
advice
to
me
last
May,
which,
considering
the
event,
shows
some
greatness
of
mind."
They
were
interrupted
by
Miss
Bennet,
who
came
to
fetch
her
mother's
tea.
"This
is
a
parade,"
he
cried,
"which
does
one
good;
it
gives
such
an
elegance
to
misfortune!
Another
day
I
will
do
the
same;
I
will
sit
in
my
library,
in
my
nightcap
and
powdering
gown,
and
give
as
much
trouble
as
I
can;
or,
perhaps,
I
may
defer
it
till
Kitty
runs
away."
"I
am
not
going
to
run
away,
papa,"
said
Kitty
fretfully.
"If
I
should
ever
go
to
Brighton,
I
would
behave
better
than
Lydia."
"You
go
to
Brighton.
I
would
not
trust
you
so
near
it
as
Eastbourne
for
fifty
pounds!
No,
Kitty,
I
have
at
last
learnt
to
be
cautious,
and
you
will
feel
the
effects
of
it.
No
officer
is
ever
to
enter
into
my
house
again,
nor
even
to
pass
through
the
village.
Balls
will
be
absolutely
prohibited,
unless
you
stand
up
with
one
of
your
sisters.
And
you
are
never
to
stir
out
of
doors
till
you
can
prove
that
you
have
spent
ten
minutes
of
every
day
in
a
rational
manner."
Kitty,
who
took
all
these
threats
in
a
serious
light,
began
to
cry.
"Well,
well,"
said
he,
"do
not
make
yourself
unhappy.
If
you
are
a
good
girl
for
the
next
ten
years,
I
will
take
you
to
a
review
at
the
end
of
them."
Two
days
after
Mr.
Bennet's
return,
as
Jane
and
Elizabeth
were
walking
together
in
the
shrubbery
behind
the
house,
they
saw
the
housekeeper
coming
towards
them,
and,
concluding
that
she
came
to
