fires
and
carriages
would
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
in
most
cases
of
delicate
health,
and
I
dare
say
in
her's.
I
do
not
require
you
to
adopt
all
my
suspicions,
though
you
make
so
noble
a
profession
of
doing
it,
but
I
honestly
tell
you
what
they
are."
"And,
upon
my
word,
they
have
an
air
of
great
probability.
Mr.
Dixon's
preference
of
her
music
to
her
friend's,
I
can
answer
for
being
very
decided."
"And
then,
he
saved
her
life.
Did
you
ever
hear
of
that?
A
water
party;
and
by
some
accident
she
was
falling
overboard.
He
caught
her."
"He
did.
I
was
there
one
of
the
party."
"Were
you
really?
Well!
But
you
observed
nothing
of
course,
for
it
seems
to
be
a
new
idea
to
you.
If
I
had
been
there,
I
think
I
should
have
made
some
discoveries."
"I
dare
say
you
would;
but
I,
simple
I,
saw
nothing
but
the
fact,
that
Miss
Fairfax
was
nearly
dashed
from
the
vessel
and
that
Mr.
Dixon
caught
her.
It
was
the
work
of
a
moment.
And
though
the
consequent
shock
and
alarm
was
very
great
and
much
more
durable
indeed
I
believe
it
was
half
an
hour
before
any
of
us
were
comfortable
again
yet
that
was
too
general
a
sensation
for
any
thing
of
peculiar
anxiety
to
be
observable.
I
do
not
mean
to
say,
however,
that
you
might
not
have
made
discoveries."
The
conversation
was
here
interrupted.
They
were
called
on
to
share
in
the
awkwardness
of
a
rather
long
interval
between
the
courses,
and
obliged
to
be
as
formal
and
as
orderly
as
the
others;
but
when
the
table
was
again
safely
covered,
when
every
corner
dish
was
placed
exactly
right,
and
occupation
and
ease
were
generally
restored,
Emma
said,
"The
arrival
of
this
pianoforte
is
decisive
with
me.
I
wanted
to
know
a
little
more,
and
this
tells
me
quite
enough.
Depend
upon
it,
we
shall
soon
hear
that
it
is
a
present
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon."
"And
if
the
Dixons
should
absolutely
deny
all
knowledge
of
it
we
must
conclude
it
to
come
from
the
Campbells."
"No,
I
am
sure
it
is
not
from
the
Campbells.
Miss
Fairfax
knows
it
is
not
from
the
Campbells,
or
they
would
have
been
guessed
at
first.
She
would
not
have
been
puzzled,
had
she
dared
fix
on
them.
I
may
not
have
convinced
you
perhaps,
but
I
am
perfectly
convinced
myself
that
Mr.
Dixon
is
a
principal
in
the
business."
"Indeed
you
injure
me
if
you
suppose
me
unconvinced.
Your
reasonings
carry
my
judgment
along
with
them
entirely.
At
first,
while
I
supposed
you
satisfied
that
Colonel
Campbell
was
the
giver,
I
saw
it
only
as
paternal
kindness,
and
thought
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world.
But
when
you
mentioned
Mrs.
Dixon,
I
felt
how
much
more
probable
that
it
should
be
the
tribute
of
warm
female
friendship.
And
now
I
can
see
it
in
no
other
light
than
