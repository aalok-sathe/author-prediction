Bennet
saw
that
her
whole
heart
was
in
the
subject,
and
affectionately
taking
her
hand
said
in
reply:
"Do
not
make
yourself
uneasy,
my
love.
Wherever
you
and
Jane
are
known
you
must
be
respected
and
valued;
and
you
will
not
appear
to
less
advantage
for
having
a
couple
of
or
I
may
say,
three
very
silly
sisters.
We
shall
have
no
peace
at
Longbourn
if
Lydia
does
not
go
to
Brighton.
Let
her
go,
then.
Colonel
Forster
is
a
sensible
man,
and
will
keep
her
out
of
any
real
mischief;
and
she
is
luckily
too
poor
to
be
an
object
of
prey
to
anybody.
At
Brighton
she
will
be
of
less
importance
even
as
a
common
flirt
than
she
has
been
here.
The
officers
will
find
women
better
worth
their
notice.
Let
us
hope,
therefore,
that
her
being
there
may
teach
her
her
own
insignificance.
At
any
rate,
she
cannot
grow
many
degrees
worse,
without
authorising
us
to
lock
her
up
for
the
rest
of
her
life."
With
this
answer
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
be
content;
but
her
own
opinion
continued
the
same,
and
she
left
him
disappointed
and
sorry.
It
was
not
in
her
nature,
however,
to
increase
her
vexations
by
dwelling
on
them.
She
was
confident
of
having
performed
her
duty,
and
to
fret
over
unavoidable
evils,
or
augment
them
by
anxiety,
was
no
part
of
her
disposition.
Had
Lydia
and
her
mother
known
the
substance
of
her
conference
with
her
father,
their
indignation
would
hardly
have
found
expression
in
their
united
volubility.
In
Lydia's
imagination,
a
visit
to
Brighton
comprised
every
possibility
of
earthly
happiness.
She
saw,
with
the
creative
eye
of
fancy,
the
streets
of
that
gay
bathing
place
covered
with
officers.
She
saw
herself
the
object
of
attention,
to
tens
and
to
scores
of
them
at
present
unknown.
She
saw
all
the
glories
of
the
camp
its
tents
stretched
forth
in
beauteous
uniformity
of
lines,
crowded
with
the
young
and
the
gay,
and
dazzling
with
scarlet;
and,
to
complete
the
view,
she
saw
herself
seated
beneath
a
tent,
tenderly
flirting
with
at
least
six
officers
at
once.
Had
she
known
her
sister
sought
to
tear
her
from
such
prospects
and
such
realities
as
these,
what
would
have
been
her
sensations?
They
could
have
been
understood
only
by
her
mother,
who
might
have
felt
nearly
the
same.
Lydia's
going
to
Brighton
was
all
that
consoled
her
for
her
melancholy
conviction
of
her
husband's
never
intending
to
go
there
himself.
But
they
were
entirely
ignorant
of
what
had
passed;
and
their
raptures
continued,
with
little
intermission,
to
the
very
day
of
Lydia's
leaving
home.
Elizabeth
was
now
to
see
Mr.
Wickham
for
the
last
time.
Having
been
frequently
in
company
with
him
since
her
return,
agitation
was
pretty
well
over;
the
agitations
of
former
partiality
entirely
so.
She
had
even
learnt
to
detect,
in
the
very
gentleness
which
had
first
delighted
her,
an
affectation
and
a
sameness
to
disgust
and
weary.
In
his
present
behaviour
to
