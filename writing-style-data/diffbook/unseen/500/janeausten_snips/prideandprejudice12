they
met,
that
he
did
admire
her
and
to
her
it
was
equally
evident
that
Jane
was
yielding
to
the
preference
which
she
had
begun
to
entertain
for
him
from
the
first,
and
was
in
a
way
to
be
very
much
in
love;
but
she
considered
with
pleasure
that
it
was
not
likely
to
be
discovered
by
the
world
in
general,
since
Jane
united,
with
great
strength
of
feeling,
a
composure
of
temper
and
a
uniform
cheerfulness
of
manner
which
would
guard
her
from
the
suspicions
of
the
impertinent.
She
mentioned
this
to
her
friend
Miss
Lucas.
"It
may
perhaps
be
pleasant,"
replied
Charlotte,
"to
be
able
to
impose
on
the
public
in
such
a
case;
but
it
is
sometimes
a
disadvantage
to
be
so
very
guarded.
If
a
woman
conceals
her
affection
with
the
same
skill
from
the
object
of
it,
she
may
lose
the
opportunity
of
fixing
him;
and
it
will
then
be
but
poor
consolation
to
believe
the
world
equally
in
the
dark.
There
is
so
much
of
gratitude
or
vanity
in
almost
every
attachment,
that
it
is
not
safe
to
leave
any
to
itself.
We
can
all
begin
freely
a
slight
preference
is
natural
enough;
but
there
are
very
few
of
us
who
have
heart
enough
to
be
really
in
love
without
encouragement.
In
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
women
had
better
show
more
affection
than
she
feels.
Bingley
likes
your
sister
undoubtedly;
but
he
may
never
do
more
than
like
her,
if
she
does
not
help
him
on."
"But
she
does
help
him
on,
as
much
as
her
nature
will
allow.
If
I
can
perceive
her
regard
for
him,
he
must
be
a
simpleton,
indeed,
not
to
discover
it
too."
"Remember,
Eliza,
that
he
does
not
know
Jane's
disposition
as
you
do."
"But
if
a
woman
is
partial
to
a
man,
and
does
not
endeavour
to
conceal
it,
he
must
find
it
out."
"Perhaps
he
must,
if
he
sees
enough
of
her.
But,
though
Bingley
and
Jane
meet
tolerably
often,
it
is
never
for
many
hours
together;
and,
as
they
always
see
each
other
in
large
mixed
parties,
it
is
impossible
that
every
moment
should
be
employed
in
conversing
together.
Jane
should
therefore
make
the
most
of
every
half
hour
in
which
she
can
command
his
attention.
When
she
is
secure
of
him,
there
will
be
more
leisure
for
falling
in
love
as
much
as
she
chooses."
"Your
plan
is
a
good
one,"
replied
Elizabeth,
"where
nothing
is
in
question
but
the
desire
of
being
well
married,
and
if
I
were
determined
to
get
a
rich
husband,
or
any
husband,
I
dare
say
I
should
adopt
it.
But
these
are
not
Jane's
feelings;
she
is
not
acting
by
design.
As
yet,
she
cannot
even
be
certain
of
the
degree
of
her
own
regard
nor
of
its
reasonableness.
She
has
known
him
only
a
fortnight.
She
danced
four
dances
with
him
at
Meryton;
she
saw
him
one
morning
at
his
own
house,
and
has
since
