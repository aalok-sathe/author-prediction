always
told
you
he
would
be
here
again
soon,
did
not
I?
Anne,
my
dear,
did
not
I
always
tell
you
so,
and
you
would
not
believe
me?
In
town
next
week,
you
see
at
the
latest,
I
dare
say;
for
she
is
as
impatient
as
the
black
gentleman
when
any
thing
is
to
be
done;
most
likely
they
will
be
there
to
morrow
or
Saturday.
As
to
her
illness,
all
nothing
of
course.
But
it
is
an
excellent
thing
to
have
Frank
among
us
again,
so
near
as
town.
They
will
stay
a
good
while
when
they
do
come,
and
he
will
be
half
his
time
with
us.
This
is
precisely
what
I
wanted.
Well,
pretty
good
news,
is
not
it?
Have
you
finished
it?
Has
Emma
read
it
all?
Put
it
up,
put
it
up;
we
will
have
a
good
talk
about
it
some
other
time,
but
it
will
not
do
now.
I
shall
only
just
mention
the
circumstance
to
the
others
in
a
common
way."
Mrs.
Weston
was
most
comfortably
pleased
on
the
occasion.
Her
looks
and
words
had
nothing
to
restrain
them.
She
was
happy,
she
knew
she
was
happy,
and
knew
she
ought
to
be
happy.
Her
congratulations
were
warm
and
open;
but
Emma
could
not
speak
so
fluently.
She
was
a
little
occupied
in
weighing
her
own
feelings,
and
trying
to
understand
the
degree
of
her
agitation,
which
she
rather
thought
was
considerable.
Mr.
Weston,
however,
too
eager
to
be
very
observant,
too
communicative
to
want
others
to
talk,
was
very
well
satisfied
with
what
she
did
say,
and
soon
moved
away
to
make
the
rest
of
his
friends
happy
by
a
partial
communication
of
what
the
whole
room
must
have
overheard
already.
It
was
well
that
he
took
every
body's
joy
for
granted,
or
he
might
not
have
thought
either
Mr.
Woodhouse
or
Mr.
Knightley
particularly
delighted.
They
were
the
first
entitled,
after
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma,
to
be
made
happy;
from
them
he
would
have
proceeded
to
Miss
Fairfax,
but
she
was
so
deep
in
conversation
with
John
Knightley,
that
it
would
have
been
too
positive
an
interruption;
and
finding
himself
close
to
Mrs.
Elton,
and
her
attention
disengaged,
he
necessarily
began
on
the
subject
with
her.
"I
hope
I
shall
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
my
son
to
you,"
said
Mr.
Weston.
Mrs.
Elton,
very
willing
to
suppose
a
particular
compliment
intended
her
by
such
a
hope,
smiled
most
graciously.
"You
have
heard
of
a
certain
Frank
Churchill,
I
presume,"
he
continued
"and
know
him
to
be
my
son,
though
he
does
not
bear
my
name."
"Oh!
yes,
and
I
shall
be
very
happy
in
his
acquaintance.
I
am
sure
Mr.
Elton
will
lose
no
time
in
calling
on
him;
and
we
shall
both
have
great
pleasure
in
seeing
him
at
the
Vicarage."
"You
are
very
obliging.
Frank
will
be
extremely
happy,
I
am
sure.
He
is
to
be
in
town
next
week,
if
not
sooner.
