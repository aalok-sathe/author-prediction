known
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
by
character
perfectly
well.
Here
consequently
was
an
inexhaustible
subject
of
discourse.
In
comparing
her
recollection
of
Pemberley
with
the
minute
description
which
Wickham
could
give,
and
in
bestowing
her
tribute
of
praise
on
the
character
of
its
late
possessor,
she
was
delighting
both
him
and
herself.
On
being
made
acquainted
with
the
present
Mr.
Darcy's
treatment
of
him,
she
tried
to
remember
some
of
that
gentleman's
reputed
disposition
when
quite
a
lad
which
might
agree
with
it,
and
was
confident
at
last
that
she
recollected
having
heard
Mr.
Fitzwilliam
Darcy
formerly
spoken
of
as
a
very
proud,
ill
natured
boy.
Mrs.
Gardiner's
caution
to
Elizabeth
was
punctually
and
kindly
given
on
the
first
favourable
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
alone;
after
honestly
telling
her
what
she
thought,
she
thus
went
on:
"You
are
too
sensible
a
girl,
Lizzy,
to
fall
in
love
merely
because
you
are
warned
against
it;
and,
therefore,
I
am
not
afraid
of
speaking
openly.
Seriously,
I
would
have
you
be
on
your
guard.
Do
not
involve
yourself
or
endeavour
to
involve
him
in
an
affection
which
the
want
of
fortune
would
make
so
very
imprudent.
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
him;
he
is
a
most
interesting
young
man;
and
if
he
had
the
fortune
he
ought
to
have,
I
should
think
you
could
not
do
better.
But
as
it
is,
you
must
not
let
your
fancy
run
away
with
you.
You
have
sense,
and
we
all
expect
you
to
use
it.
Your
father
would
depend
on
your
resolution
and
good
conduct,
I
am
sure.
You
must
not
disappoint
your
father."
"My
dear
aunt,
this
is
being
serious
indeed."
"Yes,
and
I
hope
to
engage
you
to
be
serious
likewise."
"Well,
then,
you
need
not
be
under
any
alarm.
I
will
take
care
of
myself,
and
of
Mr.
Wickham
too.
He
shall
not
be
in
love
with
me,
if
I
can
prevent
it."
"Elizabeth,
you
are
not
serious
now."
"I
beg
your
pardon,
I
will
try
again.
At
present
I
am
not
in
love
with
Mr.
Wickham;
no,
I
certainly
am
not.
But
he
is,
beyond
all
comparison,
the
most
agreeable
man
I
ever
saw
and
if
he
becomes
really
attached
to
me
I
believe
it
will
be
better
that
he
should
not.
I
see
the
imprudence
of
it.
Oh!
that
abominable
Mr.
Darcy!
My
father's
opinion
of
me
does
me
the
greatest
honour,
and
I
should
be
miserable
to
forfeit
it.
My
father,
however,
is
partial
to
Mr.
Wickham.
In
short,
my
dear
aunt,
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
the
means
of
making
any
of
you
unhappy;
but
since
we
see
every
day
that
where
there
is
affection,
young
people
are
seldom
withheld
by
immediate
want
of
fortune
from
entering
into
engagements
with
each
other,
how
can
I
promise
to
be
wiser
than
so
many
of
my
fellow
creatures
if
I
am
tempted,
or
how
am
I
even
to
know
that
it
would
be
wisdom
to
resist?
