ought.
But
after
all
the
punishment
that
misconduct
can
bring,
it
is
still
not
less
misconduct.
Pain
is
no
expiation.
I
never
can
be
blameless.
I
have
been
acting
contrary
to
all
my
sense
of
right;
and
the
fortunate
turn
that
every
thing
has
taken,
and
the
kindness
I
am
now
receiving,
is
what
my
conscience
tells
me
ought
not
to
be.'
'Do
not
imagine,
madam,'
she
continued,
'that
I
was
taught
wrong.
Do
not
let
any
reflection
fall
on
the
principles
or
the
care
of
the
friends
who
brought
me
up.
The
error
has
been
all
my
own;
and
I
do
assure
you
that,
with
all
the
excuse
that
present
circumstances
may
appear
to
give,
I
shall
yet
dread
making
the
story
known
to
Colonel
Campbell.'"
"Poor
girl!"
said
Emma
again.
"She
loves
him
then
excessively,
I
suppose.
It
must
have
been
from
attachment
only,
that
she
could
be
led
to
form
the
engagement.
Her
affection
must
have
overpowered
her
judgment."
"Yes,
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
being
extremely
attached
to
him."
"I
am
afraid,"
returned
Emma,
sighing,
"that
I
must
often
have
contributed
to
make
her
unhappy."
"On
your
side,
my
love,
it
was
very
innocently
done.
But
she
probably
had
something
of
that
in
her
thoughts,
when
alluding
to
the
misunderstandings
which
he
had
given
us
hints
of
before.
One
natural
consequence
of
the
evil
she
had
involved
herself
in,"
she
said,
"was
that
of
making
her
unreasonable.
The
consciousness
of
having
done
amiss,
had
exposed
her
to
a
thousand
inquietudes,
and
made
her
captious
and
irritable
to
a
degree
that
must
have
been
that
had
been
hard
for
him
to
bear.
'I
did
not
make
the
allowances,'
said
she,
'which
I
ought
to
have
done,
for
his
temper
and
spirits
his
delightful
spirits,
and
that
gaiety,
that
playfulness
of
disposition,
which,
under
any
other
circumstances,
would,
I
am
sure,
have
been
as
constantly
bewitching
to
me,
as
they
were
at
first.'
She
then
began
to
speak
of
you,
and
of
the
great
kindness
you
had
shewn
her
during
her
illness;
and
with
a
blush
which
shewed
me
how
it
was
all
connected,
desired
me,
whenever
I
had
an
opportunity,
to
thank
you
I
could
not
thank
you
too
much
for
every
wish
and
every
endeavour
to
do
her
good.
She
was
sensible
that
you
had
never
received
any
proper
acknowledgment
from
herself."
"If
I
did
not
know
her
to
be
happy
now,"
said
Emma,
seriously,
"which,
in
spite
of
every
little
drawback
from
her
scrupulous
conscience,
she
must
be,
I
could
not
bear
these
thanks;
for,
oh!
Mrs.
Weston,
if
there
were
an
account
drawn
up
of
the
evil
and
the
good
I
have
done
Miss
Fairfax!
Well
(checking
herself,
and
trying
to
be
more
lively),
this
is
all
to
be
forgotten.
You
are
very
kind
to
bring
me
these
interesting
particulars.
They
shew
her
to
the
greatest
advantage.
I
am
sure
she
is
very
good
I
hope
she
will
be
very
happy.
It
is
