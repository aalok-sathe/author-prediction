happened
before
tea,
but
not
that.
Mr.
Elton
was
called
out
of
the
room
before
tea,
old
John
Abdy's
son
wanted
to
speak
with
him.
Poor
old
John,
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him;
he
was
clerk
to
my
poor
father
twenty
seven
years;
and
now,
poor
old
man,
he
is
bed
ridden,
and
very
poorly
with
the
rheumatic
gout
in
his
joints
I
must
go
and
see
him
to
day;
and
so
will
Jane,
I
am
sure,
if
she
gets
out
at
all.
And
poor
John's
son
came
to
talk
to
Mr.
Elton
about
relief
from
the
parish;
he
is
very
well
to
do
himself,
you
know,
being
head
man
at
the
Crown,
ostler,
and
every
thing
of
that
sort,
but
still
he
cannot
keep
his
father
without
some
help;
and
so,
when
Mr.
Elton
came
back,
he
told
us
what
John
ostler
had
been
telling
him,
and
then
it
came
out
about
the
chaise
having
been
sent
to
Randalls
to
take
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
Richmond.
That
was
what
happened
before
tea.
It
was
after
tea
that
Jane
spoke
to
Mrs.
Elton."
Miss
Bates
would
hardly
give
Emma
time
to
say
how
perfectly
new
this
circumstance
was
to
her;
but
as
without
supposing
it
possible
that
she
could
be
ignorant
of
any
of
the
particulars
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill's
going,
she
proceeded
to
give
them
all,
it
was
of
no
consequence.
What
Mr.
Elton
had
learned
from
the
ostler
on
the
subject,
being
the
accumulation
of
the
ostler's
own
knowledge,
and
the
knowledge
of
the
servants
at
Randalls,
was,
that
a
messenger
had
come
over
from
Richmond
soon
after
the
return
of
the
party
from
Box
Hill
which
messenger,
however,
had
been
no
more
than
was
expected;
and
that
Mr.
Churchill
had
sent
his
nephew
a
few
lines,
containing,
upon
the
whole,
a
tolerable
account
of
Mrs.
Churchill,
and
only
wishing
him
not
to
delay
coming
back
beyond
the
next
morning
early;
but
that
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
having
resolved
to
go
home
directly,
without
waiting
at
all,
and
his
horse
seeming
to
have
got
a
cold,
Tom
had
been
sent
off
immediately
for
the
Crown
chaise,
and
the
ostler
had
stood
out
and
seen
it
pass
by,
the
boy
going
a
good
pace,
and
driving
very
steady.
There
was
nothing
in
all
this
either
to
astonish
or
interest,
and
it
caught
Emma's
attention
only
as
it
united
with
the
subject
which
already
engaged
her
mind.
The
contrast
between
Mrs.
Churchill's
importance
in
the
world,
and
Jane
Fairfax's,
struck
her;
one
was
every
thing,
the
other
nothing
and
she
sat
musing
on
the
difference
of
woman's
destiny,
and
quite
unconscious
on
what
her
eyes
were
fixed,
till
roused
by
Miss
Bates's
saying,
"Aye,
I
see
what
you
are
thinking
of,
the
pianoforte.
What
is
to
become
of
that?
Very
true.
Poor
dear
Jane
was
talking
of
it
just
now.
'You
must
go,'
said
she.
'You
and
I
must
part.
You
will
have
no
business
here.
Let
it
stay,
