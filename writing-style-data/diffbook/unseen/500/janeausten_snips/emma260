sorry,
very
sorry.
Her
heart
was
grieved
for
a
state
which
seemed
but
the
more
pitiable
from
this
sort
of
irritation
of
spirits,
inconsistency
of
action,
and
inequality
of
powers;
and
it
mortified
her
that
she
was
given
so
little
credit
for
proper
feeling,
or
esteemed
so
little
worthy
as
a
friend:
but
she
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
her
intentions
were
good,
and
of
being
able
to
say
to
herself,
that
could
Mr.
Knightley
have
been
privy
to
all
her
attempts
of
assisting
Jane
Fairfax,
could
he
even
have
seen
into
her
heart,
he
would
not,
on
this
occasion,
have
found
any
thing
to
reprove.
One
morning,
about
ten
days
after
Mrs.
Churchill's
decease,
Emma
was
called
downstairs
to
Mr.
Weston,
who
"could
not
stay
five
minutes,
and
wanted
particularly
to
speak
with
her."
He
met
her
at
the
parlour
door,
and
hardly
asking
her
how
she
did,
in
the
natural
key
of
his
voice,
sunk
it
immediately,
to
say,
unheard
by
her
father,
"Can
you
come
to
Randalls
at
any
time
this
morning?
Do,
if
it
be
possible.
Mrs.
Weston
wants
to
see
you.
She
must
see
you."
"Is
she
unwell?"
"No,
no,
not
at
all
only
a
little
agitated.
She
would
have
ordered
the
carriage,
and
come
to
you,
but
she
must
see
you
alone,
and
that
you
know
(nodding
towards
her
father)
Humph!
Can
you
come?"
"Certainly.
This
moment,
if
you
please.
It
is
impossible
to
refuse
what
you
ask
in
such
a
way.
But
what
can
be
the
matter?
Is
she
really
not
ill?"
"Depend
upon
me
but
ask
no
more
questions.
You
will
know
it
all
in
time.
The
most
unaccountable
business!
But
hush,
hush!"
To
guess
what
all
this
meant,
was
impossible
even
for
Emma.
Something
really
important
seemed
announced
by
his
looks;
but,
as
her
friend
was
well,
she
endeavoured
not
to
be
uneasy,
and
settling
it
with
her
father,
that
she
would
take
her
walk
now,
she
and
Mr.
Weston
were
soon
out
of
the
house
together
and
on
their
way
at
a
quick
pace
for
Randalls.
"Now,"
said
Emma,
when
they
were
fairly
beyond
the
sweep
gates,
"now
Mr.
Weston,
do
let
me
know
what
has
happened."
"No,
no,"
he
gravely
replied.
"Don't
ask
me.
I
promised
my
wife
to
leave
it
all
to
her.
She
will
break
it
to
you
better
than
I
can.
Do
not
be
impatient,
Emma;
it
will
all
come
out
too
soon."
"Break
it
to
me,"
cried
Emma,
standing
still
with
terror.
"Good
God!
Mr.
Weston,
tell
me
at
once.
Something
has
happened
in
Brunswick
Square.
I
know
it
has.
Tell
me,
I
charge
you
tell
me
this
moment
what
it
is."
"No,
indeed
you
are
mistaken."
"Mr.
Weston
do
not
trifle
with
me.
Consider
how
many
of
my
dearest
friends
are
now
in
Brunswick
Square.
Which
of
them
is
it?
I
charge
you
by
all
that
is
sacred,
not
to
attempt
concealment."
"Upon
my
word,
Emma."
"Your
word!
why
not
your
honour!
why
