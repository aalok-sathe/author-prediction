cannot
afford
it.
And
what
claims
has
Lydia
what
attraction
has
she
beyond
youth,
health,
and
good
humour
that
could
make
him,
for
her
sake,
forego
every
chance
of
benefiting
himself
by
marrying
well?
As
to
what
restraint
the
apprehensions
of
disgrace
in
the
corps
might
throw
on
a
dishonourable
elopement
with
her,
I
am
not
able
to
judge;
for
I
know
nothing
of
the
effects
that
such
a
step
might
produce.
But
as
to
your
other
objection,
I
am
afraid
it
will
hardly
hold
good.
Lydia
has
no
brothers
to
step
forward;
and
he
might
imagine,
from
my
father's
behaviour,
from
his
indolence
and
the
little
attention
he
has
ever
seemed
to
give
to
what
was
going
forward
in
his
family,
that
he
would
do
as
little,
and
think
as
little
about
it,
as
any
father
could
do,
in
such
a
matter."
"But
can
you
think
that
Lydia
is
so
lost
to
everything
but
love
of
him
as
to
consent
to
live
with
him
on
any
terms
other
than
marriage?"
"It
does
seem,
and
it
is
most
shocking
indeed,"
replied
Elizabeth,
with
tears
in
her
eyes,
"that
a
sister's
sense
of
decency
and
virtue
in
such
a
point
should
admit
of
doubt.
But,
really,
I
know
not
what
to
say.
Perhaps
I
am
not
doing
her
justice.
But
she
is
very
young;
she
has
never
been
taught
to
think
on
serious
subjects;
and
for
the
last
half
year,
nay,
for
a
twelvemonth
she
has
been
given
up
to
nothing
but
amusement
and
vanity.
She
has
been
allowed
to
dispose
of
her
time
in
the
most
idle
and
frivolous
manner,
and
to
adopt
any
opinions
that
came
in
her
way.
Since
the
shire
were
first
quartered
in
Meryton,
nothing
but
love,
flirtation,
and
officers
have
been
in
her
head.
She
has
been
doing
everything
in
her
power
by
thinking
and
talking
on
the
subject,
to
give
greater
what
shall
I
call
it?
susceptibility
to
her
feelings;
which
are
naturally
lively
enough.
And
we
all
know
that
Wickham
has
every
charm
of
person
and
address
that
can
captivate
a
woman."
"But
you
see
that
Jane,"
said
her
aunt,
"does
not
think
so
very
ill
of
Wickham
as
to
believe
him
capable
of
the
attempt."
"Of
whom
does
Jane
ever
think
ill?
And
who
is
there,
whatever
might
be
their
former
conduct,
that
she
would
think
capable
of
such
an
attempt,
till
it
were
proved
against
them?
But
Jane
knows,
as
well
as
I
do,
what
Wickham
really
is.
We
both
know
that
he
has
been
profligate
in
every
sense
of
the
word;
that
he
has
neither
integrity
nor
honour;
that
he
is
as
false
and
deceitful
as
he
is
insinuating."
"And
do
you
really
know
all
this?"
cried
Mrs.
Gardiner,
whose
curiosity
as
to
the
mode
of
her
intelligence
was
all
alive.
"I
do
indeed,"
replied
Elizabeth,
colouring.
"I
told
you,
the
other
day,
of
his
infamous
behaviour
to
Mr.
Darcy;
and
you
yourself,
when
last
at
Longbourn,
heard
in
