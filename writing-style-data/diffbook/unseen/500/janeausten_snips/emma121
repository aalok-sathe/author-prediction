agitation
of
meeting
Mr.
Martin.
The
unhappiness
produced
by
the
knowledge
of
that
engagement
had
been
a
little
put
aside
by
Elizabeth
Martin's
calling
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
a
few
days
afterwards.
Harriet
had
not
been
at
home;
but
a
note
had
been
prepared
and
left
for
her,
written
in
the
very
style
to
touch;
a
small
mixture
of
reproach,
with
a
great
deal
of
kindness;
and
till
Mr.
Elton
himself
appeared,
she
had
been
much
occupied
by
it,
continually
pondering
over
what
could
be
done
in
return,
and
wishing
to
do
more
than
she
dared
to
confess.
But
Mr.
Elton,
in
person,
had
driven
away
all
such
cares.
While
he
staid,
the
Martins
were
forgotten;
and
on
the
very
morning
of
his
setting
off
for
Bath
again,
Emma,
to
dissipate
some
of
the
distress
it
occasioned,
judged
it
best
for
her
to
return
Elizabeth
Martin's
visit.
How
that
visit
was
to
be
acknowledged
what
would
be
necessary
and
what
might
be
safest,
had
been
a
point
of
some
doubtful
consideration.
Absolute
neglect
of
the
mother
and
sisters,
when
invited
to
come,
would
be
ingratitude.
It
must
not
be:
and
yet
the
danger
of
a
renewal
of
the
acquaintance
!
After
much
thinking,
she
could
determine
on
nothing
better,
than
Harriet's
returning
the
visit;
but
in
a
way
that,
if
they
had
understanding,
should
convince
them
that
it
was
to
be
only
a
formal
acquaintance.
She
meant
to
take
her
in
the
carriage,
leave
her
at
the
Abbey
Mill,
while
she
drove
a
little
farther,
and
call
for
her
again
so
soon,
as
to
allow
no
time
for
insidious
applications
or
dangerous
recurrences
to
the
past,
and
give
the
most
decided
proof
of
what
degree
of
intimacy
was
chosen
for
the
future.
She
could
think
of
nothing
better:
and
though
there
was
something
in
it
which
her
own
heart
could
not
approve
something
of
ingratitude,
merely
glossed
over
it
must
be
done,
or
what
would
become
of
Harriet?
Small
heart
had
Harriet
for
visiting.
Only
half
an
hour
before
her
friend
called
for
her
at
Mrs.
Goddard's,
her
evil
stars
had
led
her
to
the
very
spot
where,
at
that
moment,
a
trunk,
directed
to
The
Rev.
Philip
Elton,
White
Hart,
Bath,
was
to
be
seen
under
the
operation
of
being
lifted
into
the
butcher's
cart,
which
was
to
convey
it
to
where
the
coaches
past;
and
every
thing
in
this
world,
excepting
that
trunk
and
the
direction,
was
consequently
a
blank.
She
went,
however;
and
when
they
reached
the
farm,
and
she
was
to
be
put
down,
at
the
end
of
the
broad,
neat
gravel
walk,
which
led
between
espalier
apple
trees
to
the
front
door,
the
sight
of
every
thing
which
had
given
her
so
much
pleasure
the
autumn
before,
was
beginning
to
revive
a
little
local
agitation;
and
when
they
parted,
Emma
observed
her
to
be
looking
around
with
a
sort
of
fearful
curiosity,
which
determined
her
not
to
allow
the
visit
to
exceed
the
proposed
quarter
of
