on
them
for
ever,
and
therefore
she
seldom
went
near
them.
But
now
she
made
the
sudden
resolution
of
not
passing
their
door
without
going
in
observing,
as
she
proposed
it
to
Harriet,
that,
as
well
as
she
could
calculate,
they
were
just
now
quite
safe
from
any
letter
from
Jane
Fairfax.
The
house
belonged
to
people
in
business.
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
occupied
the
drawing
room
floor;
and
there,
in
the
very
moderate
sized
apartment,
which
was
every
thing
to
them,
the
visitors
were
most
cordially
and
even
gratefully
welcomed;
the
quiet
neat
old
lady,
who
with
her
knitting
was
seated
in
the
warmest
corner,
wanting
even
to
give
up
her
place
to
Miss
Woodhouse,
and
her
more
active,
talking
daughter,
almost
ready
to
overpower
them
with
care
and
kindness,
thanks
for
their
visit,
solicitude
for
their
shoes,
anxious
inquiries
after
Mr.
Woodhouse's
health,
cheerful
communications
about
her
mother's,
and
sweet
cake
from
the
beaufet
"Mrs.
Cole
had
just
been
there,
just
called
in
for
ten
minutes,
and
had
been
so
good
as
to
sit
an
hour
with
them,
and
she
had
taken
a
piece
of
cake
and
been
so
kind
as
to
say
she
liked
it
very
much;
and,
therefore,
she
hoped
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Smith
would
do
them
the
favour
to
eat
a
piece
too."
The
mention
of
the
Coles
was
sure
to
be
followed
by
that
of
Mr.
Elton.
There
was
intimacy
between
them,
and
Mr.
Cole
had
heard
from
Mr.
Elton
since
his
going
away.
Emma
knew
what
was
coming;
they
must
have
the
letter
over
again,
and
settle
how
long
he
had
been
gone,
and
how
much
he
was
engaged
in
company,
and
what
a
favourite
he
was
wherever
he
went,
and
how
full
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies'
ball
had
been;
and
she
went
through
it
very
well,
with
all
the
interest
and
all
the
commendation
that
could
be
requisite,
and
always
putting
forward
to
prevent
Harriet's
being
obliged
to
say
a
word.
This
she
had
been
prepared
for
when
she
entered
the
house;
but
meant,
having
once
talked
him
handsomely
over,
to
be
no
farther
incommoded
by
any
troublesome
topic,
and
to
wander
at
large
amongst
all
the
Mistresses
and
Misses
of
Highbury,
and
their
card
parties.
She
had
not
been
prepared
to
have
Jane
Fairfax
succeed
Mr.
Elton;
but
he
was
actually
hurried
off
by
Miss
Bates,
she
jumped
away
from
him
at
last
abruptly
to
the
Coles,
to
usher
in
a
letter
from
her
niece.
"Oh!
yes
Mr.
Elton,
I
understand
certainly
as
to
dancing
Mrs.
Cole
was
telling
me
that
dancing
at
the
rooms
at
Bath
was
Mrs.
Cole
was
so
kind
as
to
sit
some
time
with
us,
talking
of
Jane;
for
as
soon
as
she
came
in,
she
began
inquiring
after
her,
Jane
is
so
very
great
a
favourite
there.
Whenever
she
is
with
us,
Mrs.
Cole
does
not
know
how
to
shew
her
kindness
enough;
and
I
must
say
that
Jane
deserves
it
as
much
