claims
on
Mr.
Darcy,
and
all
that
he
had
suffered
from
him,
was
now
openly
acknowledged
and
publicly
canvassed;
and
everybody
was
pleased
to
know
how
much
they
had
always
disliked
Mr.
Darcy
before
they
had
known
anything
of
the
matter.
Miss
Bennet
was
the
only
creature
who
could
suppose
there
might
be
any
extenuating
circumstances
in
the
case,
unknown
to
the
society
of
Hertfordshire;
her
mild
and
steady
candour
always
pleaded
for
allowances,
and
urged
the
possibility
of
mistakes
but
by
everybody
else
Mr.
Darcy
was
condemned
as
the
worst
of
men.
After
a
week
spent
in
professions
of
love
and
schemes
of
felicity,
Mr.
Collins
was
called
from
his
amiable
Charlotte
by
the
arrival
of
Saturday.
The
pain
of
separation,
however,
might
be
alleviated
on
his
side,
by
preparations
for
the
reception
of
his
bride;
as
he
had
reason
to
hope,
that
shortly
after
his
return
into
Hertfordshire,
the
day
would
be
fixed
that
was
to
make
him
the
happiest
of
men.
He
took
leave
of
his
relations
at
Longbourn
with
as
much
solemnity
as
before;
wished
his
fair
cousins
health
and
happiness
again,
and
promised
their
father
another
letter
of
thanks.
On
the
following
Monday,
Mrs.
Bennet
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
her
brother
and
his
wife,
who
came
as
usual
to
spend
the
Christmas
at
Longbourn.
Mr.
Gardiner
was
a
sensible,
gentlemanlike
man,
greatly
superior
to
his
sister,
as
well
by
nature
as
education.
The
Netherfield
ladies
would
have
had
difficulty
in
believing
that
a
man
who
lived
by
trade,
and
within
view
of
his
own
warehouses,
could
have
been
so
well
bred
and
agreeable.
Mrs.
Gardiner,
who
was
several
years
younger
than
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Mrs.
Phillips,
was
an
amiable,
intelligent,
elegant
woman,
and
a
great
favourite
with
all
her
Longbourn
nieces.
Between
the
two
eldest
and
herself
especially,
there
subsisted
a
particular
regard.
They
had
frequently
been
staying
with
her
in
town.
The
first
part
of
Mrs.
Gardiner's
business
on
her
arrival
was
to
distribute
her
presents
and
describe
the
newest
fashions.
When
this
was
done
she
had
a
less
active
part
to
play.
It
became
her
turn
to
listen.
Mrs.
Bennet
had
many
grievances
to
relate,
and
much
to
complain
of.
They
had
all
been
very
ill
used
since
she
last
saw
her
sister.
Two
of
her
girls
had
been
upon
the
point
of
marriage,
and
after
all
there
was
nothing
in
it.
"I
do
not
blame
Jane,"
she
continued,
"for
Jane
would
have
got
Mr.
Bingley
if
she
could.
But
Lizzy!
Oh,
sister!
It
is
very
hard
to
think
that
she
might
have
been
Mr.
Collins's
wife
by
this
time,
had
it
not
been
for
her
own
perverseness.
He
made
her
an
offer
in
this
very
room,
and
she
refused
him.
The
consequence
of
it
is,
that
Lady
Lucas
will
have
a
daughter
married
before
I
have,
and
that
the
Longbourn
estate
is
just
as
much
entailed
as
ever.
The
Lucases
are
very
artful
people
indeed,
sister.
They
are
all
for
what
