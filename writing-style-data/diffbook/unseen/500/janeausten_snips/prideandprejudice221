did
not
answer
to
that
of
any
of
their
neighbours.
The
horses
were
post;
and
neither
the
carriage,
nor
the
livery
of
the
servant
who
preceded
it,
were
familiar
to
them.
As
it
was
certain,
however,
that
somebody
was
coming,
Bingley
instantly
prevailed
on
Miss
Bennet
to
avoid
the
confinement
of
such
an
intrusion,
and
walk
away
with
him
into
the
shrubbery.
They
both
set
off,
and
the
conjectures
of
the
remaining
three
continued,
though
with
little
satisfaction,
till
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
their
visitor
entered.
It
was
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh.
They
were
of
course
all
intending
to
be
surprised;
but
their
astonishment
was
beyond
their
expectation;
and
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Kitty,
though
she
was
perfectly
unknown
to
them,
even
inferior
to
what
Elizabeth
felt.
She
entered
the
room
with
an
air
more
than
usually
ungracious,
made
no
other
reply
to
Elizabeth's
salutation
than
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head,
and
sat
down
without
saying
a
word.
Elizabeth
had
mentioned
her
name
to
her
mother
on
her
ladyship's
entrance,
though
no
request
of
introduction
had
been
made.
Mrs.
Bennet,
all
amazement,
though
flattered
by
having
a
guest
of
such
high
importance,
received
her
with
the
utmost
politeness.
After
sitting
for
a
moment
in
silence,
she
said
very
stiffly
to
Elizabeth,
"I
hope
you
are
well,
Miss
Bennet.
That
lady,
I
suppose,
is
your
mother."
Elizabeth
replied
very
concisely
that
she
was.
"And
that
I
suppose
is
one
of
your
sisters."
"Yes,
madam,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet,
delighted
to
speak
to
Lady
Catherine.
"She
is
my
youngest
girl
but
one.
My
youngest
of
all
is
lately
married,
and
my
eldest
is
somewhere
about
the
grounds,
walking
with
a
young
man
who,
I
believe,
will
soon
become
a
part
of
the
family."
"You
have
a
very
small
park
here,"
returned
Lady
Catherine
after
a
short
silence.
"It
is
nothing
in
comparison
of
Rosings,
my
lady,
I
dare
say;
but
I
assure
you
it
is
much
larger
than
Sir
William
Lucas's."
"This
must
be
a
most
inconvenient
sitting
room
for
the
evening,
in
summer;
the
windows
are
full
west."
Mrs.
Bennet
assured
her
that
they
never
sat
there
after
dinner,
and
then
added:
"May
I
take
the
liberty
of
asking
your
ladyship
whether
you
left
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
well."
"Yes,
very
well.
I
saw
them
the
night
before
last."
Elizabeth
now
expected
that
she
would
produce
a
letter
for
her
from
Charlotte,
as
it
seemed
the
only
probable
motive
for
her
calling.
But
no
letter
appeared,
and
she
was
completely
puzzled.
Mrs.
Bennet,
with
great
civility,
begged
her
ladyship
to
take
some
refreshment;
but
Lady
Catherine
very
resolutely,
and
not
very
politely,
declined
eating
anything;
and
then,
rising
up,
said
to
Elizabeth,
"Miss
Bennet,
there
seemed
to
be
a
prettyish
kind
of
a
little
wilderness
on
one
side
of
your
lawn.
I
should
be
glad
to
take
a
turn
in
it,
if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company."
"Go,
my
dear,"
cried
her
mother,
"and
