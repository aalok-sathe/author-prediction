of
a
solitary
drive
from
Vicarage
Lane
turning
a
corner
which
he
could
never
bear
to
think
of
and
in
strange
hands
a
mere
common
coachman
no
James;
and
there
it
seemed
as
if
her
return
only
were
wanted
to
make
every
thing
go
well:
for
Mr.
John
Knightley,
ashamed
of
his
ill
humour,
was
now
all
kindness
and
attention;
and
so
particularly
solicitous
for
the
comfort
of
her
father,
as
to
seem
if
not
quite
ready
to
join
him
in
a
basin
of
gruel
perfectly
sensible
of
its
being
exceedingly
wholesome;
and
the
day
was
concluding
in
peace
and
comfort
to
all
their
little
party,
except
herself.
But
her
mind
had
never
been
in
such
perturbation;
and
it
needed
a
very
strong
effort
to
appear
attentive
and
cheerful
till
the
usual
hour
of
separating
allowed
her
the
relief
of
quiet
reflection.
The
hair
was
curled,
and
the
maid
sent
away,
and
Emma
sat
down
to
think
and
be
miserable.
It
was
a
wretched
business
indeed!
Such
an
overthrow
of
every
thing
she
had
been
wishing
for!
Such
a
development
of
every
thing
most
unwelcome!
Such
a
blow
for
Harriet!
that
was
the
worst
of
all.
Every
part
of
it
brought
pain
and
humiliation,
of
some
sort
or
other;
but,
compared
with
the
evil
to
Harriet,
all
was
light;
and
she
would
gladly
have
submitted
to
feel
yet
more
mistaken
more
in
error
more
disgraced
by
mis
judgment,
than
she
actually
was,
could
the
effects
of
her
blunders
have
been
confined
to
herself.
"If
I
had
not
persuaded
Harriet
into
liking
the
man,
I
could
have
borne
any
thing.
He
might
have
doubled
his
presumption
to
me
but
poor
Harriet!"
How
she
could
have
been
so
deceived!
He
protested
that
he
had
never
thought
seriously
of
Harriet
never!
She
looked
back
as
well
as
she
could;
but
it
was
all
confusion.
She
had
taken
up
the
idea,
she
supposed,
and
made
every
thing
bend
to
it.
His
manners,
however,
must
have
been
unmarked,
wavering,
dubious,
or
she
could
not
have
been
so
misled.
The
picture!
How
eager
he
had
been
about
the
picture!
and
the
charade!
and
an
hundred
other
circumstances;
how
clearly
they
had
seemed
to
point
at
Harriet.
To
be
sure,
the
charade,
with
its
"ready
wit"
but
then
the
"soft
eyes"
in
fact
it
suited
neither;
it
was
a
jumble
without
taste
or
truth.
Who
could
have
seen
through
such
thick
headed
nonsense?
Certainly
she
had
often,
especially
of
late,
thought
his
manners
to
herself
unnecessarily
gallant;
but
it
had
passed
as
his
way,
as
a
mere
error
of
judgment,
of
knowledge,
of
taste,
as
one
proof
among
others
that
he
had
not
always
lived
in
the
best
society,
that
with
all
the
gentleness
of
his
address,
true
elegance
was
sometimes
wanting;
but,
till
this
very
day,
she
had
never,
for
an
instant,
suspected
it
to
mean
any
thing
but
grateful
respect
to
her
as
Harriet's
friend.
To
Mr.
John
Knightley
was
she
indebted
for
her
first
