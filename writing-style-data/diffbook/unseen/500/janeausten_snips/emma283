miserable
creature."
"Mr.
Knightley,"
said
Emma,
trying
to
be
lively,
but
really
confused
"I
am
in
a
very
extraordinary
situation.
I
cannot
let
you
continue
in
your
error;
and
yet,
perhaps,
since
my
manners
gave
such
an
impression,
I
have
as
much
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
confessing
that
I
never
have
been
at
all
attached
to
the
person
we
are
speaking
of,
as
it
might
be
natural
for
a
woman
to
feel
in
confessing
exactly
the
reverse.
But
I
never
have."
He
listened
in
perfect
silence.
She
wished
him
to
speak,
but
he
would
not.
She
supposed
she
must
say
more
before
she
were
entitled
to
his
clemency;
but
it
was
a
hard
case
to
be
obliged
still
to
lower
herself
in
his
opinion.
She
went
on,
however.
"I
have
very
little
to
say
for
my
own
conduct.
I
was
tempted
by
his
attentions,
and
allowed
myself
to
appear
pleased.
An
old
story,
probably
a
common
case
and
no
more
than
has
happened
to
hundreds
of
my
sex
before;
and
yet
it
may
not
be
the
more
excusable
in
one
who
sets
up
as
I
do
for
Understanding.
Many
circumstances
assisted
the
temptation.
He
was
the
son
of
Mr.
Weston
he
was
continually
here
I
always
found
him
very
pleasant
and,
in
short,
for
(with
a
sigh)
let
me
swell
out
the
causes
ever
so
ingeniously,
they
all
centre
in
this
at
last
my
vanity
was
flattered,
and
I
allowed
his
attentions.
Latterly,
however
for
some
time,
indeed
I
have
had
no
idea
of
their
meaning
any
thing.
I
thought
them
a
habit,
a
trick,
nothing
that
called
for
seriousness
on
my
side.
He
has
imposed
on
me,
but
he
has
not
injured
me.
I
have
never
been
attached
to
him.
And
now
I
can
tolerably
comprehend
his
behaviour.
He
never
wished
to
attach
me.
It
was
merely
a
blind
to
conceal
his
real
situation
with
another.
It
was
his
object
to
blind
all
about
him;
and
no
one,
I
am
sure,
could
be
more
effectually
blinded
than
myself
except
that
I
was
not
blinded
that
it
was
my
good
fortune
that,
in
short,
I
was
somehow
or
other
safe
from
him."
She
had
hoped
for
an
answer
here
for
a
few
words
to
say
that
her
conduct
was
at
least
intelligible;
but
he
was
silent;
and,
as
far
as
she
could
judge,
deep
in
thought.
At
last,
and
tolerably
in
his
usual
tone,
he
said,
"I
have
never
had
a
high
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill.
I
can
suppose,
however,
that
I
may
have
underrated
him.
My
acquaintance
with
him
has
been
but
trifling.
And
even
if
I
have
not
underrated
him
hitherto,
he
may
yet
turn
out
well.
With
such
a
woman
he
has
a
chance.
I
have
no
motive
for
wishing
him
ill
and
for
her
sake,
whose
happiness
will
be
involved
in
his
good
character
and
conduct,
I
shall
certainly
wish
him
well."
"I
have
no
doubt
of
their
being
happy
together,"
said
Emma;
"I
believe
