this
extraordinary
application
have
been
as
frivolous
as
the
application
was
ill
judged.
You
have
widely
mistaken
my
character,
if
you
think
I
can
be
worked
on
by
such
persuasions
as
these.
How
far
your
nephew
might
approve
of
your
interference
in
his
affairs,
I
cannot
tell;
but
you
have
certainly
no
right
to
concern
yourself
in
mine.
I
must
beg,
therefore,
to
be
importuned
no
farther
on
the
subject."
"Not
so
hasty,
if
you
please.
I
have
by
no
means
done.
To
all
the
objections
I
have
already
urged,
I
have
still
another
to
add.
I
am
no
stranger
to
the
particulars
of
your
youngest
sister's
infamous
elopement.
I
know
it
all;
that
the
young
man's
marrying
her
was
a
patched
up
business,
at
the
expence
of
your
father
and
uncles.
And
is
such
a
girl
to
be
my
nephew's
sister?
Is
her
husband,
is
the
son
of
his
late
father's
steward,
to
be
his
brother?
Heaven
and
earth!
of
what
are
you
thinking?
Are
the
shades
of
Pemberley
to
be
thus
polluted?"
"You
can
now
have
nothing
further
to
say,"
she
resentfully
answered.
"You
have
insulted
me
in
every
possible
method.
I
must
beg
to
return
to
the
house."
And
she
rose
as
she
spoke.
Lady
Catherine
rose
also,
and
they
turned
back.
Her
ladyship
was
highly
incensed.
"You
have
no
regard,
then,
for
the
honour
and
credit
of
my
nephew!
Unfeeling,
selfish
girl!
Do
you
not
consider
that
a
connection
with
you
must
disgrace
him
in
the
eyes
of
everybody?"
"Lady
Catherine,
I
have
nothing
further
to
say.
You
know
my
sentiments."
"You
are
then
resolved
to
have
him?"
"I
have
said
no
such
thing.
I
am
only
resolved
to
act
in
that
manner,
which
will,
in
my
own
opinion,
constitute
my
happiness,
without
reference
to
you,
or
to
any
person
so
wholly
unconnected
with
me."
"It
is
well.
You
refuse,
then,
to
oblige
me.
You
refuse
to
obey
the
claims
of
duty,
honour,
and
gratitude.
You
are
determined
to
ruin
him
in
the
opinion
of
all
his
friends,
and
make
him
the
contempt
of
the
world."
"Neither
duty,
nor
honour,
nor
gratitude,"
replied
Elizabeth,
"have
any
possible
claim
on
me,
in
the
present
instance.
No
principle
of
either
would
be
violated
by
my
marriage
with
Mr.
Darcy.
And
with
regard
to
the
resentment
of
his
family,
or
the
indignation
of
the
world,
if
the
former
were
excited
by
his
marrying
me,
it
would
not
give
me
one
moment's
concern
and
the
world
in
general
would
have
too
much
sense
to
join
in
the
scorn."
"And
this
is
your
real
opinion!
This
is
your
final
resolve!
Very
well.
I
shall
now
know
how
to
act.
Do
not
imagine,
Miss
Bennet,
that
your
ambition
will
ever
be
gratified.
I
came
to
try
you.
I
hoped
to
find
you
reasonable;
but,
depend
upon
it,
I
will
carry
my
point."
In
this
manner
Lady
Catherine
talked
on,
till
they
were
at
the
door
of
the
carriage,
when,
turning
hastily
round,
