to
the
infinite
mortification
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Churchill,
who
threw
her
off
with
due
decorum.
It
was
an
unsuitable
connexion,
and
did
not
produce
much
happiness.
Mrs.
Weston
ought
to
have
found
more
in
it,
for
she
had
a
husband
whose
warm
heart
and
sweet
temper
made
him
think
every
thing
due
to
her
in
return
for
the
great
goodness
of
being
in
love
with
him;
but
though
she
had
one
sort
of
spirit,
she
had
not
the
best.
She
had
resolution
enough
to
pursue
her
own
will
in
spite
of
her
brother,
but
not
enough
to
refrain
from
unreasonable
regrets
at
that
brother's
unreasonable
anger,
nor
from
missing
the
luxuries
of
her
former
home.
They
lived
beyond
their
income,
but
still
it
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
Enscombe:
she
did
not
cease
to
love
her
husband,
but
she
wanted
at
once
to
be
the
wife
of
Captain
Weston,
and
Miss
Churchill
of
Enscombe.
Captain
Weston,
who
had
been
considered,
especially
by
the
Churchills,
as
making
such
an
amazing
match,
was
proved
to
have
much
the
worst
of
the
bargain;
for
when
his
wife
died,
after
a
three
years'
marriage,
he
was
rather
a
poorer
man
than
at
first,
and
with
a
child
to
maintain.
From
the
expense
of
the
child,
however,
he
was
soon
relieved.
The
boy
had,
with
the
additional
softening
claim
of
a
lingering
illness
of
his
mother's,
been
the
means
of
a
sort
of
reconciliation;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Churchill,
having
no
children
of
their
own,
nor
any
other
young
creature
of
equal
kindred
to
care
for,
offered
to
take
the
whole
charge
of
the
little
Frank
soon
after
her
decease.
Some
scruples
and
some
reluctance
the
widower
father
may
be
supposed
to
have
felt;
but
as
they
were
overcome
by
other
considerations,
the
child
was
given
up
to
the
care
and
the
wealth
of
the
Churchills,
and
he
had
only
his
own
comfort
to
seek,
and
his
own
situation
to
improve
as
he
could.
A
complete
change
of
life
became
desirable.
He
quitted
the
militia
and
engaged
in
trade,
having
brothers
already
established
in
a
good
way
in
London,
which
afforded
him
a
favourable
opening.
It
was
a
concern
which
brought
just
employment
enough.
He
had
still
a
small
house
in
Highbury,
where
most
of
his
leisure
days
were
spent;
and
between
useful
occupation
and
the
pleasures
of
society,
the
next
eighteen
or
twenty
years
of
his
life
passed
cheerfully
away.
He
had,
by
that
time,
realised
an
easy
competence
enough
to
secure
the
purchase
of
a
little
estate
adjoining
Highbury,
which
he
had
always
longed
for
enough
to
marry
a
woman
as
portionless
even
as
Miss
Taylor,
and
to
live
according
to
the
wishes
of
his
own
friendly
and
social
disposition.
It
was
now
some
time
since
Miss
Taylor
had
begun
to
influence
his
schemes;
but
as
it
was
not
the
tyrannic
influence
of
youth
on
youth,
it
had
not
shaken
his
determination
of
never
settling
till
he
could
purchase
Randalls,
and
the
