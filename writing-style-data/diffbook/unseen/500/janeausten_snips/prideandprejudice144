older."
In
vain
did
Elizabeth
attempt
to
make
her
reasonable,
and
Jane
to
make
her
resigned.
As
for
Elizabeth
herself,
this
invitation
was
so
far
from
exciting
in
her
the
same
feelings
as
in
her
mother
and
Lydia,
that
she
considered
it
as
the
death
warrant
of
all
possibility
of
common
sense
for
the
latter;
and
detestable
as
such
a
step
must
make
her
were
it
known,
she
could
not
help
secretly
advising
her
father
not
to
let
her
go.
She
represented
to
him
all
the
improprieties
of
Lydia's
general
behaviour,
the
little
advantage
she
could
derive
from
the
friendship
of
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Forster,
and
the
probability
of
her
being
yet
more
imprudent
with
such
a
companion
at
Brighton,
where
the
temptations
must
be
greater
than
at
home.
He
heard
her
attentively,
and
then
said:
"Lydia
will
never
be
easy
until
she
has
exposed
herself
in
some
public
place
or
other,
and
we
can
never
expect
her
to
do
it
with
so
little
expense
or
inconvenience
to
her
family
as
under
the
present
circumstances."
"If
you
were
aware,"
said
Elizabeth,
"of
the
very
great
disadvantage
to
us
all
which
must
arise
from
the
public
notice
of
Lydia's
unguarded
and
imprudent
manner
nay,
which
has
already
arisen
from
it,
I
am
sure
you
would
judge
differently
in
the
affair."
"Already
arisen?"
repeated
Mr.
Bennet.
"What,
has
she
frightened
away
some
of
your
lovers?
Poor
little
Lizzy!
But
do
not
be
cast
down.
Such
squeamish
youths
as
cannot
bear
to
be
connected
with
a
little
absurdity
are
not
worth
a
regret.
Come,
let
me
see
the
list
of
pitiful
fellows
who
have
been
kept
aloof
by
Lydia's
folly."
"Indeed
you
are
mistaken.
I
have
no
such
injuries
to
resent.
It
is
not
of
particular,
but
of
general
evils,
which
I
am
now
complaining.
Our
importance,
our
respectability
in
the
world
must
be
affected
by
the
wild
volatility,
the
assurance
and
disdain
of
all
restraint
which
mark
Lydia's
character.
Excuse
me,
for
I
must
speak
plainly.
If
you,
my
dear
father,
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
checking
her
exuberant
spirits,
and
of
teaching
her
that
her
present
pursuits
are
not
to
be
the
business
of
her
life,
she
will
soon
be
beyond
the
reach
of
amendment.
Her
character
will
be
fixed,
and
she
will,
at
sixteen,
be
the
most
determined
flirt
that
ever
made
herself
or
her
family
ridiculous;
a
flirt,
too,
in
the
worst
and
meanest
degree
of
flirtation;
without
any
attraction
beyond
youth
and
a
tolerable
person;
and,
from
the
ignorance
and
emptiness
of
her
mind,
wholly
unable
to
ward
off
any
portion
of
that
universal
contempt
which
her
rage
for
admiration
will
excite.
In
this
danger
Kitty
also
is
comprehended.
She
will
follow
wherever
Lydia
leads.
Vain,
ignorant,
idle,
and
absolutely
uncontrolled!
Oh!
my
dear
father,
can
you
suppose
it
possible
that
they
will
not
be
censured
and
despised
wherever
they
are
known,
and
that
their
sisters
will
not
be
often
involved
in
the
disgrace?"
Mr.
