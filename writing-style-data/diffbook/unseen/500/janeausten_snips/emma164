of
it.
That
young
man
(speaking
lower)
is
very
thoughtless.
Do
not
tell
his
father,
but
that
young
man
is
not
quite
the
thing.
He
has
been
opening
the
doors
very
often
this
evening,
and
keeping
them
open
very
inconsiderately.
He
does
not
think
of
the
draught.
I
do
not
mean
to
set
you
against
him,
but
indeed
he
is
not
quite
the
thing!"
Mrs.
Weston
was
sorry
for
such
a
charge.
She
knew
the
importance
of
it,
and
said
every
thing
in
her
power
to
do
it
away.
Every
door
was
now
closed,
the
passage
plan
given
up,
and
the
first
scheme
of
dancing
only
in
the
room
they
were
in
resorted
to
again;
and
with
such
good
will
on
Frank
Churchill's
part,
that
the
space
which
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
had
been
deemed
barely
sufficient
for
five
couple,
was
now
endeavoured
to
be
made
out
quite
enough
for
ten.
"We
were
too
magnificent,"
said
he.
"We
allowed
unnecessary
room.
Ten
couple
may
stand
here
very
well."
Emma
demurred.
"It
would
be
a
crowd
a
sad
crowd;
and
what
could
be
worse
than
dancing
without
space
to
turn
in?"
"Very
true,"
he
gravely
replied;
"it
was
very
bad."
But
still
he
went
on
measuring,
and
still
he
ended
with,
"I
think
there
will
be
very
tolerable
room
for
ten
couple."
"No,
no,"
said
she,
"you
are
quite
unreasonable.
It
would
be
dreadful
to
be
standing
so
close!
Nothing
can
be
farther
from
pleasure
than
to
be
dancing
in
a
crowd
and
a
crowd
in
a
little
room!"
"There
is
no
denying
it,"
he
replied.
"I
agree
with
you
exactly.
A
crowd
in
a
little
room
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
have
the
art
of
giving
pictures
in
a
few
words.
Exquisite,
quite
exquisite!
Still,
however,
having
proceeded
so
far,
one
is
unwilling
to
give
the
matter
up.
It
would
be
a
disappointment
to
my
father
and
altogether
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
rather
of
opinion
that
ten
couple
might
stand
here
very
well."
Emma
perceived
that
the
nature
of
his
gallantry
was
a
little
self
willed,
and
that
he
would
rather
oppose
than
lose
the
pleasure
of
dancing
with
her;
but
she
took
the
compliment,
and
forgave
the
rest.
Had
she
intended
ever
to
marry
him,
it
might
have
been
worth
while
to
pause
and
consider,
and
try
to
understand
the
value
of
his
preference,
and
the
character
of
his
temper;
but
for
all
the
purposes
of
their
acquaintance,
he
was
quite
amiable
enough.
Before
the
middle
of
the
next
day,
he
was
at
Hartfield;
and
he
entered
the
room
with
such
an
agreeable
smile
as
certified
the
continuance
of
the
scheme.
It
soon
appeared
that
he
came
to
announce
an
improvement.
"Well,
Miss
Woodhouse,"
he
almost
immediately
began,
"your
inclination
for
dancing
has
not
been
quite
frightened
away,
I
hope,
by
the
terrors
of
my
father's
little
rooms.
I
bring
a
new
proposal
on
the
subject:
a
thought
of
my
father's,
which
waits
only
your
approbation
