thing,"
cried
Mrs.
Elton
emphatically,
"which
I
should
not
have
thought
myself
privileged
to
inquire
into.
Though,
perhaps,
as
the
Chaperon
of
the
party
I
never
was
in
any
circle
exploring
parties
young
ladies
married
women
"
Her
mutterings
were
chiefly
to
her
husband;
and
he
murmured,
in
reply,
"Very
true,
my
love,
very
true.
Exactly
so,
indeed
quite
unheard
of
but
some
ladies
say
any
thing.
Better
pass
it
off
as
a
joke.
Every
body
knows
what
is
due
to
you."
"It
will
not
do,"
whispered
Frank
to
Emma;
"they
are
most
of
them
affronted.
I
will
attack
them
with
more
address.
Ladies
and
gentlemen
I
am
ordered
by
Miss
Woodhouse
to
say,
that
she
waives
her
right
of
knowing
exactly
what
you
may
all
be
thinking
of,
and
only
requires
something
very
entertaining
from
each
of
you,
in
a
general
way.
Here
are
seven
of
you,
besides
myself,
(who,
she
is
pleased
to
say,
am
very
entertaining
already,)
and
she
only
demands
from
each
of
you
either
one
thing
very
clever,
be
it
prose
or
verse,
original
or
repeated
or
two
things
moderately
clever
or
three
things
very
dull
indeed,
and
she
engages
to
laugh
heartily
at
them
all."
"Oh!
very
well,"
exclaimed
Miss
Bates,
"then
I
need
not
be
uneasy.
'Three
things
very
dull
indeed.'
That
will
just
do
for
me,
you
know.
I
shall
be
sure
to
say
three
dull
things
as
soon
as
ever
I
open
my
mouth,
shan't
I?
(looking
round
with
the
most
good
humoured
dependence
on
every
body's
assent)
Do
not
you
all
think
I
shall?"
Emma
could
not
resist.
"Ah!
ma'am,
but
there
may
be
a
difficulty.
Pardon
me
but
you
will
be
limited
as
to
number
only
three
at
once."
Miss
Bates,
deceived
by
the
mock
ceremony
of
her
manner,
did
not
immediately
catch
her
meaning;
but,
when
it
burst
on
her,
it
could
not
anger,
though
a
slight
blush
shewed
that
it
could
pain
her.
"Ah!
well
to
be
sure.
Yes,
I
see
what
she
means,
(turning
to
Mr.
Knightley,)
and
I
will
try
to
hold
my
tongue.
I
must
make
myself
very
disagreeable,
or
she
would
not
have
said
such
a
thing
to
an
old
friend."
"I
like
your
plan,"
cried
Mr.
Weston.
"Agreed,
agreed.
I
will
do
my
best.
I
am
making
a
conundrum.
How
will
a
conundrum
reckon?"
"Low,
I
am
afraid,
sir,
very
low,"
answered
his
son;
"but
we
shall
be
indulgent
especially
to
any
one
who
leads
the
way."
"No,
no,"
said
Emma,
"it
will
not
reckon
low.
A
conundrum
of
Mr.
Weston's
shall
clear
him
and
his
next
neighbour.
Come,
sir,
pray
let
me
hear
it."
"I
doubt
its
being
very
clever
myself,"
said
Mr.
Weston.
"It
is
too
much
a
matter
of
fact,
but
here
it
is.
What
two
letters
of
the
alphabet
are
there,
that
express
perfection?"
"What
two
letters!
express
perfection!
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know."
"Ah!
you
will
never
guess.
You,
(to
Emma),
I
am
certain,
will
