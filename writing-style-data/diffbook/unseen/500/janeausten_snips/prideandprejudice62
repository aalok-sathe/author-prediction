of
nothing
else
but
her
expectation
that
Jane
would
soon
be
married
to
Mr.
Bingley.
It
was
an
animating
subject,
and
Mrs.
Bennet
seemed
incapable
of
fatigue
while
enumerating
the
advantages
of
the
match.
His
being
such
a
charming
young
man,
and
so
rich,
and
living
but
three
miles
from
them,
were
the
first
points
of
self
gratulation;
and
then
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
think
how
fond
the
two
sisters
were
of
Jane,
and
to
be
certain
that
they
must
desire
the
connection
as
much
as
she
could
do.
It
was,
moreover,
such
a
promising
thing
for
her
younger
daughters,
as
Jane's
marrying
so
greatly
must
throw
them
in
the
way
of
other
rich
men;
and
lastly,
it
was
so
pleasant
at
her
time
of
life
to
be
able
to
consign
her
single
daughters
to
the
care
of
their
sister,
that
she
might
not
be
obliged
to
go
into
company
more
than
she
liked.
It
was
necessary
to
make
this
circumstance
a
matter
of
pleasure,
because
on
such
occasions
it
is
the
etiquette;
but
no
one
was
less
likely
than
Mrs.
Bennet
to
find
comfort
in
staying
home
at
any
period
of
her
life.
She
concluded
with
many
good
wishes
that
Lady
Lucas
might
soon
be
equally
fortunate,
though
evidently
and
triumphantly
believing
there
was
no
chance
of
it.
In
vain
did
Elizabeth
endeavour
to
check
the
rapidity
of
her
mother's
words,
or
persuade
her
to
describe
her
felicity
in
a
less
audible
whisper;
for,
to
her
inexpressible
vexation,
she
could
perceive
that
the
chief
of
it
was
overheard
by
Mr.
Darcy,
who
sat
opposite
to
them.
Her
mother
only
scolded
her
for
being
nonsensical.
"What
is
Mr.
Darcy
to
me,
pray,
that
I
should
be
afraid
of
him?
I
am
sure
we
owe
him
no
such
particular
civility
as
to
be
obliged
to
say
nothing
he
may
not
like
to
hear."
"For
heaven's
sake,
madam,
speak
lower.
What
advantage
can
it
be
for
you
to
offend
Mr.
Darcy?
You
will
never
recommend
yourself
to
his
friend
by
so
doing!"
Nothing
that
she
could
say,
however,
had
any
influence.
Her
mother
would
talk
of
her
views
in
the
same
intelligible
tone.
Elizabeth
blushed
and
blushed
again
with
shame
and
vexation.
She
could
not
help
frequently
glancing
her
eye
at
Mr.
Darcy,
though
every
glance
convinced
her
of
what
she
dreaded;
for
though
he
was
not
always
looking
at
her
mother,
she
was
convinced
that
his
attention
was
invariably
fixed
by
her.
The
expression
of
his
face
changed
gradually
from
indignant
contempt
to
a
composed
and
steady
gravity.
At
length,
however,
Mrs.
Bennet
had
no
more
to
say;
and
Lady
Lucas,
who
had
been
long
yawning
at
the
repetition
of
delights
which
she
saw
no
likelihood
of
sharing,
was
left
to
the
comforts
of
cold
ham
and
chicken.
Elizabeth
now
began
to
revive.
But
not
long
was
the
interval
of
tranquillity;
for,
when
supper
was
over,
singing
was
talked
of,
and
she
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
Mary,
after
