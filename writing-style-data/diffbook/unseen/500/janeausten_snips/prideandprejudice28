in
attending
to
what
passed
between
Darcy
and
his
companion.
The
perpetual
commendations
of
the
lady,
either
on
his
handwriting,
or
on
the
evenness
of
his
lines,
or
on
the
length
of
his
letter,
with
the
perfect
unconcern
with
which
her
praises
were
received,
formed
a
curious
dialogue,
and
was
exactly
in
union
with
her
opinion
of
each.
"How
delighted
Miss
Darcy
will
be
to
receive
such
a
letter!"
He
made
no
answer.
"You
write
uncommonly
fast."
"You
are
mistaken.
I
write
rather
slowly."
"How
many
letters
you
must
have
occasion
to
write
in
the
course
of
a
year!
Letters
of
business,
too!
How
odious
I
should
think
them!"
"It
is
fortunate,
then,
that
they
fall
to
my
lot
instead
of
yours."
"Pray
tell
your
sister
that
I
long
to
see
her."
"I
have
already
told
her
so
once,
by
your
desire."
"I
am
afraid
you
do
not
like
your
pen.
Let
me
mend
it
for
you.
I
mend
pens
remarkably
well."
"Thank
you
but
I
always
mend
my
own."
"How
can
you
contrive
to
write
so
even?"
He
was
silent.
"Tell
your
sister
I
am
delighted
to
hear
of
her
improvement
on
the
harp;
and
pray
let
her
know
that
I
am
quite
in
raptures
with
her
beautiful
little
design
for
a
table,
and
I
think
it
infinitely
superior
to
Miss
Grantley's."
"Will
you
give
me
leave
to
defer
your
raptures
till
I
write
again?
At
present
I
have
not
room
to
do
them
justice."
"Oh!
it
is
of
no
consequence.
I
shall
see
her
in
January.
But
do
you
always
write
such
charming
long
letters
to
her,
Mr.
Darcy?"
"They
are
generally
long;
but
whether
always
charming
it
is
not
for
me
to
determine."
"It
is
a
rule
with
me,
that
a
person
who
can
write
a
long
letter
with
ease,
cannot
write
ill."
"That
will
not
do
for
a
compliment
to
Darcy,
Caroline,"
cried
her
brother,
"because
he
does
not
write
with
ease.
He
studies
too
much
for
words
of
four
syllables.
Do
not
you,
Darcy?"
"My
style
of
writing
is
very
different
from
yours."
"Oh!"
cried
Miss
Bingley,
"Charles
writes
in
the
most
careless
way
imaginable.
He
leaves
out
half
his
words,
and
blots
the
rest."
"My
ideas
flow
so
rapidly
that
I
have
not
time
to
express
them
by
which
means
my
letters
sometimes
convey
no
ideas
at
all
to
my
correspondents."
"Your
humility,
Mr.
Bingley,"
said
Elizabeth,
"must
disarm
reproof."
"Nothing
is
more
deceitful,"
said
Darcy,
"than
the
appearance
of
humility.
It
is
often
only
carelessness
of
opinion,
and
sometimes
an
indirect
boast."
"And
which
of
the
two
do
you
call
my
little
recent
piece
of
modesty?"
"The
indirect
boast;
for
you
are
really
proud
of
your
defects
in
writing,
because
you
consider
them
as
proceeding
from
a
rapidity
of
thought
and
carelessness
of
execution,
which,
if
not
estimable,
you
think
at
least
highly
interesting.
The
power
of
doing
anything
with
quickness
is
always
prized
much
by
the
possessor,
and
often
without
any
attention
