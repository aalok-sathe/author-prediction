spirited
beginning
of
your
winter
engagements,
sir.
Something
new
for
your
coachman
and
horses
to
be
making
their
way
through
a
storm
of
snow."
Poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
silent
from
consternation;
but
every
body
else
had
something
to
say;
every
body
was
either
surprized
or
not
surprized,
and
had
some
question
to
ask,
or
some
comfort
to
offer.
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma
tried
earnestly
to
cheer
him
and
turn
his
attention
from
his
son
in
law,
who
was
pursuing
his
triumph
rather
unfeelingly.
"I
admired
your
resolution
very
much,
sir,"
said
he,
"in
venturing
out
in
such
weather,
for
of
course
you
saw
there
would
be
snow
very
soon.
Every
body
must
have
seen
the
snow
coming
on.
I
admired
your
spirit;
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
get
home
very
well.
Another
hour
or
two's
snow
can
hardly
make
the
road
impassable;
and
we
are
two
carriages;
if
one
is
blown
over
in
the
bleak
part
of
the
common
field
there
will
be
the
other
at
hand.
I
dare
say
we
shall
be
all
safe
at
Hartfield
before
midnight."
Mr.
Weston,
with
triumph
of
a
different
sort,
was
confessing
that
he
had
known
it
to
be
snowing
some
time,
but
had
not
said
a
word,
lest
it
should
make
Mr.
Woodhouse
uncomfortable,
and
be
an
excuse
for
his
hurrying
away.
As
to
there
being
any
quantity
of
snow
fallen
or
likely
to
fall
to
impede
their
return,
that
was
a
mere
joke;
he
was
afraid
they
would
find
no
difficulty.
He
wished
the
road
might
be
impassable,
that
he
might
be
able
to
keep
them
all
at
Randalls;
and
with
the
utmost
good
will
was
sure
that
accommodation
might
be
found
for
every
body,
calling
on
his
wife
to
agree
with
him,
that
with
a
little
contrivance,
every
body
might
be
lodged,
which
she
hardly
knew
how
to
do,
from
the
consciousness
of
there
being
but
two
spare
rooms
in
the
house.
"What
is
to
be
done,
my
dear
Emma?
what
is
to
be
done?"
was
Mr.
Woodhouse's
first
exclamation,
and
all
that
he
could
say
for
some
time.
To
her
he
looked
for
comfort;
and
her
assurances
of
safety,
her
representation
of
the
excellence
of
the
horses,
and
of
James,
and
of
their
having
so
many
friends
about
them,
revived
him
a
little.
His
eldest
daughter's
alarm
was
equal
to
his
own.
The
horror
of
being
blocked
up
at
Randalls,
while
her
children
were
at
Hartfield,
was
full
in
her
imagination;
and
fancying
the
road
to
be
now
just
passable
for
adventurous
people,
but
in
a
state
that
admitted
no
delay,
she
was
eager
to
have
it
settled,
that
her
father
and
Emma
should
remain
at
Randalls,
while
she
and
her
husband
set
forward
instantly
through
all
the
possible
accumulations
of
drifted
snow
that
might
impede
them.
"You
had
better
order
the
carriage
directly,
my
love,"
said
she;
"I
dare
say
we
shall
be
able
to
get
along,
if
we
set
off
directly;
and
if
we
do
come
