he
feared
W.
was
not
a
man
to
be
trusted.
My
poor
mother
is
really
ill,
and
keeps
her
room.
Could
she
exert
herself,
it
would
be
better;
but
this
is
not
to
be
expected.
And
as
to
my
father,
I
never
in
my
life
saw
him
so
affected.
Poor
Kitty
has
anger
for
having
concealed
their
attachment;
but
as
it
was
a
matter
of
confidence,
one
cannot
wonder.
I
am
truly
glad,
dearest
Lizzy,
that
you
have
been
spared
something
of
these
distressing
scenes;
but
now,
as
the
first
shock
is
over,
shall
I
own
that
I
long
for
your
return?
I
am
not
so
selfish,
however,
as
to
press
for
it,
if
inconvenient.
Adieu!
I
take
up
my
pen
again
to
do
what
I
have
just
told
you
I
would
not;
but
circumstances
are
such
that
I
cannot
help
earnestly
begging
you
all
to
come
here
as
soon
as
possible.
I
know
my
dear
uncle
and
aunt
so
well,
that
I
am
not
afraid
of
requesting
it,
though
I
have
still
something
more
to
ask
of
the
former.
My
father
is
going
to
London
with
Colonel
Forster
instantly,
to
try
to
discover
her.
What
he
means
to
do
I
am
sure
I
know
not;
but
his
excessive
distress
will
not
allow
him
to
pursue
any
measure
in
the
best
and
safest
way,
and
Colonel
Forster
is
obliged
to
be
at
Brighton
again
to
morrow
evening.
In
such
an
exigence,
my
uncle's
advice
and
assistance
would
be
everything
in
the
world;
he
will
immediately
comprehend
what
I
must
feel,
and
I
rely
upon
his
goodness."
"Oh!
where,
where
is
my
uncle?"
cried
Elizabeth,
darting
from
her
seat
as
she
finished
the
letter,
in
eagerness
to
follow
him,
without
losing
a
moment
of
the
time
so
precious;
but
as
she
reached
the
door
it
was
opened
by
a
servant,
and
Mr.
Darcy
appeared.
Her
pale
face
and
impetuous
manner
made
him
start,
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
to
speak,
she,
in
whose
mind
every
idea
was
superseded
by
Lydia's
situation,
hastily
exclaimed,
"I
beg
your
pardon,
but
I
must
leave
you.
I
must
find
Mr.
Gardiner
this
moment,
on
business
that
cannot
be
delayed;
I
have
not
an
instant
to
lose."
"Good
God!
what
is
the
matter?"
cried
he,
with
more
feeling
than
politeness;
then
recollecting
himself,
"I
will
not
detain
you
a
minute;
but
let
me,
or
let
the
servant
go
after
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner.
You
are
not
well
enough;
you
cannot
go
yourself."
Elizabeth
hesitated,
but
her
knees
trembled
under
her
and
she
felt
how
little
would
be
gained
by
her
attempting
to
pursue
them.
Calling
back
the
servant,
therefore,
she
commissioned
him,
though
in
so
breathless
an
accent
as
made
her
almost
unintelligible,
to
fetch
his
master
and
mistress
home
instantly.
On
his
quitting
the
room
she
sat
down,
unable
to
support
herself,
and
looking
so
miserably
ill,
that
it
was
impossible
for
Darcy
to
leave
her,
or
to
refrain
from
saying,
in
a
tone
