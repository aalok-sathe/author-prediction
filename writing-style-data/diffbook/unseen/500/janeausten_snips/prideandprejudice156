a
few
moments
without
saying
a
word,
he
suddenly
recollected
himself,
and
took
leave.
The
others
then
joined
her,
and
expressed
admiration
of
his
figure;
but
Elizabeth
heard
not
a
word,
and
wholly
engrossed
by
her
own
feelings,
followed
them
in
silence.
She
was
overpowered
by
shame
and
vexation.
Her
coming
there
was
the
most
unfortunate,
the
most
ill
judged
thing
in
the
world!
How
strange
it
must
appear
to
him!
In
what
a
disgraceful
light
might
it
not
strike
so
vain
a
man!
It
might
seem
as
if
she
had
purposely
thrown
herself
in
his
way
again!
Oh!
why
did
she
come?
Or,
why
did
he
thus
come
a
day
before
he
was
expected?
Had
they
been
only
ten
minutes
sooner,
they
should
have
been
beyond
the
reach
of
his
discrimination;
for
it
was
plain
that
he
was
that
moment
arrived
that
moment
alighted
from
his
horse
or
his
carriage.
She
blushed
again
and
again
over
the
perverseness
of
the
meeting.
And
his
behaviour,
so
strikingly
altered
what
could
it
mean?
That
he
should
even
speak
to
her
was
amazing!
but
to
speak
with
such
civility,
to
inquire
after
her
family!
Never
in
her
life
had
she
seen
his
manners
so
little
dignified,
never
had
he
spoken
with
such
gentleness
as
on
this
unexpected
meeting.
What
a
contrast
did
it
offer
to
his
last
address
in
Rosings
Park,
when
he
put
his
letter
into
her
hand!
She
knew
not
what
to
think,
or
how
to
account
for
it.
They
had
now
entered
a
beautiful
walk
by
the
side
of
the
water,
and
every
step
was
bringing
forward
a
nobler
fall
of
ground,
or
a
finer
reach
of
the
woods
to
which
they
were
approaching;
but
it
was
some
time
before
Elizabeth
was
sensible
of
any
of
it;
and,
though
she
answered
mechanically
to
the
repeated
appeals
of
her
uncle
and
aunt,
and
seemed
to
direct
her
eyes
to
such
objects
as
they
pointed
out,
she
distinguished
no
part
of
the
scene.
Her
thoughts
were
all
fixed
on
that
one
spot
of
Pemberley
House,
whichever
it
might
be,
where
Mr.
Darcy
then
was.
She
longed
to
know
what
at
the
moment
was
passing
in
his
mind
in
what
manner
he
thought
of
her,
and
whether,
in
defiance
of
everything,
she
was
still
dear
to
him.
Perhaps
he
had
been
civil
only
because
he
felt
himself
at
ease;
yet
there
had
been
that
in
his
voice
which
was
not
like
ease.
Whether
he
had
felt
more
of
pain
or
of
pleasure
in
seeing
her
she
could
not
tell,
but
he
certainly
had
not
seen
her
with
composure.
At
length,
however,
the
remarks
of
her
companions
on
her
absence
of
mind
aroused
her,
and
she
felt
the
necessity
of
appearing
more
like
herself.
They
entered
the
woods,
and
bidding
adieu
to
the
river
for
a
while,
ascended
some
of
the
higher
grounds;
when,
in
spots
where
the
opening
of
the
trees
gave
the
eye
power
to
wander,
were
many
charming
views
of
