ending
and
there
is
the
letter.
The
child
of
good
fortune!
That
was
your
name
for
him,
was
it?"
"You
do
not
appear
so
well
satisfied
with
his
letter
as
I
am;
but
still
you
must,
at
least
I
hope
you
must,
think
the
better
of
him
for
it.
I
hope
it
does
him
some
service
with
you."
"Yes,
certainly
it
does.
He
has
had
great
faults,
faults
of
inconsideration
and
thoughtlessness;
and
I
am
very
much
of
his
opinion
in
thinking
him
likely
to
be
happier
than
he
deserves:
but
still
as
he
is,
beyond
a
doubt,
really
attached
to
Miss
Fairfax,
and
will
soon,
it
may
be
hoped,
have
the
advantage
of
being
constantly
with
her,
I
am
very
ready
to
believe
his
character
will
improve,
and
acquire
from
hers
the
steadiness
and
delicacy
of
principle
that
it
wants.
And
now,
let
me
talk
to
you
of
something
else.
I
have
another
person's
interest
at
present
so
much
at
heart,
that
I
cannot
think
any
longer
about
Frank
Churchill.
Ever
since
I
left
you
this
morning,
Emma,
my
mind
has
been
hard
at
work
on
one
subject."
The
subject
followed;
it
was
in
plain,
unaffected,
gentlemanlike
English,
such
as
Mr.
Knightley
used
even
to
the
woman
he
was
in
love
with,
how
to
be
able
to
ask
her
to
marry
him,
without
attacking
the
happiness
of
her
father.
Emma's
answer
was
ready
at
the
first
word.
"While
her
dear
father
lived,
any
change
of
condition
must
be
impossible
for
her.
She
could
never
quit
him."
Part
only
of
this
answer,
however,
was
admitted.
The
impossibility
of
her
quitting
her
father,
Mr.
Knightley
felt
as
strongly
as
herself;
but
the
inadmissibility
of
any
other
change,
he
could
not
agree
to.
He
had
been
thinking
it
over
most
deeply,
most
intently;
he
had
at
first
hoped
to
induce
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
remove
with
her
to
Donwell;
he
had
wanted
to
believe
it
feasible,
but
his
knowledge
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
not
suffer
him
to
deceive
himself
long;
and
now
he
confessed
his
persuasion,
that
such
a
transplantation
would
be
a
risk
of
her
father's
comfort,
perhaps
even
of
his
life,
which
must
not
be
hazarded.
Mr.
Woodhouse
taken
from
Hartfield!
No,
he
felt
that
it
ought
not
to
be
attempted.
But
the
plan
which
had
arisen
on
the
sacrifice
of
this,
he
trusted
his
dearest
Emma
would
not
find
in
any
respect
objectionable;
it
was,
that
he
should
be
received
at
Hartfield;
that
so
long
as
her
father's
happiness
in
other
words,
his
life
required
Hartfield
to
continue
her
home,
it
should
be
his
likewise.
Of
their
all
removing
to
Donwell,
Emma
had
already
had
her
own
passing
thoughts.
Like
him,
she
had
tried
the
scheme
and
rejected
it;
but
such
an
alternative
as
this
had
not
occurred
to
her.
She
was
sensible
of
all
the
affection
it
evinced.
She
felt
that,
in
quitting
Donwell,
he
must
be
sacrificing
a
great
deal
of
independence
of
hours
and
habits;
that
in
