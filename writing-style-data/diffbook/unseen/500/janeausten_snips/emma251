very
trying
for
us
to
part
with
her,
after
having
had
her
so
long,
and
she
has
a
dreadful
headache
just
now,
writing
all
the
morning:
such
long
letters,
you
know,
to
be
written
to
Colonel
Campbell,
and
Mrs.
Dixon.
'My
dear,'
said
I,
'you
will
blind
yourself'
for
tears
were
in
her
eyes
perpetually.
One
cannot
wonder,
one
cannot
wonder.
It
is
a
great
change;
and
though
she
is
amazingly
fortunate
such
a
situation,
I
suppose,
as
no
young
woman
before
ever
met
with
on
first
going
out
do
not
think
us
ungrateful,
Miss
Woodhouse,
for
such
surprising
good
fortune
(again
dispersing
her
tears)
but,
poor
dear
soul!
if
you
were
to
see
what
a
headache
she
has.
When
one
is
in
great
pain,
you
know
one
cannot
feel
any
blessing
quite
as
it
may
deserve.
She
is
as
low
as
possible.
To
look
at
her,
nobody
would
think
how
delighted
and
happy
she
is
to
have
secured
such
a
situation.
You
will
excuse
her
not
coming
to
you
she
is
not
able
she
is
gone
into
her
own
room
I
want
her
to
lie
down
upon
the
bed.
'My
dear,'
said
I,
'I
shall
say
you
are
laid
down
upon
the
bed:'
but,
however,
she
is
not;
she
is
walking
about
the
room.
But,
now
that
she
has
written
her
letters,
she
says
she
shall
soon
be
well.
She
will
be
extremely
sorry
to
miss
seeing
you,
Miss
Woodhouse,
but
your
kindness
will
excuse
her.
You
were
kept
waiting
at
the
door
I
was
quite
ashamed
but
somehow
there
was
a
little
bustle
for
it
so
happened
that
we
had
not
heard
the
knock,
and
till
you
were
on
the
stairs,
we
did
not
know
any
body
was
coming.
'It
is
only
Mrs.
Cole,'
said
I,
'depend
upon
it.
Nobody
else
would
come
so
early.'
'Well,'
said
she,
'it
must
be
borne
some
time
or
other,
and
it
may
as
well
be
now.'
But
then
Patty
came
in,
and
said
it
was
you.
'Oh!'
said
I,
'it
is
Miss
Woodhouse:
I
am
sure
you
will
like
to
see
her.'
'I
can
see
nobody,'
said
she;
and
up
she
got,
and
would
go
away;
and
that
was
what
made
us
keep
you
waiting
and
extremely
sorry
and
ashamed
we
were.
'If
you
must
go,
my
dear,'
said
I,
'you
must,
and
I
will
say
you
are
laid
down
upon
the
bed.'"
Emma
was
most
sincerely
interested.
Her
heart
had
been
long
growing
kinder
towards
Jane;
and
this
picture
of
her
present
sufferings
acted
as
a
cure
of
every
former
ungenerous
suspicion,
and
left
her
nothing
but
pity;
and
the
remembrance
of
the
less
just
and
less
gentle
sensations
of
the
past,
obliged
her
to
admit
that
Jane
might
very
naturally
resolve
on
seeing
Mrs.
Cole
or
any
other
steady
friend,
when
she
might
not
bear
to
see
herself.
She
spoke
as
she
felt,
with
earnest
regret
and
solicitude
sincerely
wishing
that
the
circumstances
which
she
collected
from
Miss
Bates
