walking
to
Meryton
once.
No
aunt,
no
officers,
no
news
could
be
sought
after
the
very
shoe
roses
for
Netherfield
were
got
by
proxy.
Even
Elizabeth
might
have
found
some
trial
of
her
patience
in
weather
which
totally
suspended
the
improvement
of
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Wickham;
and
nothing
less
than
a
dance
on
Tuesday,
could
have
made
such
a
Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday,
and
Monday
endurable
to
Kitty
and
Lydia.
Till
Elizabeth
entered
the
drawing
room
at
Netherfield,
and
looked
in
vain
for
Mr.
Wickham
among
the
cluster
of
red
coats
there
assembled,
a
doubt
of
his
being
present
had
never
occurred
to
her.
The
certainty
of
meeting
him
had
not
been
checked
by
any
of
those
recollections
that
might
not
unreasonably
have
alarmed
her.
She
had
dressed
with
more
than
usual
care,
and
prepared
in
the
highest
spirits
for
the
conquest
of
all
that
remained
unsubdued
of
his
heart,
trusting
that
it
was
not
more
than
might
be
won
in
the
course
of
the
evening.
But
in
an
instant
arose
the
dreadful
suspicion
of
his
being
purposely
omitted
for
Mr.
Darcy's
pleasure
in
the
Bingleys'
invitation
to
the
officers;
and
though
this
was
not
exactly
the
case,
the
absolute
fact
of
his
absence
was
pronounced
by
his
friend
Denny,
to
whom
Lydia
eagerly
applied,
and
who
told
them
that
Wickham
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
town
on
business
the
day
before,
and
was
not
yet
returned;
adding,
with
a
significant
smile,
"I
do
not
imagine
his
business
would
have
called
him
away
just
now,
if
he
had
not
wanted
to
avoid
a
certain
gentleman
here."
This
part
of
his
intelligence,
though
unheard
by
Lydia,
was
caught
by
Elizabeth,
and,
as
it
assured
her
that
Darcy
was
not
less
answerable
for
Wickham's
absence
than
if
her
first
surmise
had
been
just,
every
feeling
of
displeasure
against
the
former
was
so
sharpened
by
immediate
disappointment,
that
she
could
hardly
reply
with
tolerable
civility
to
the
polite
inquiries
which
he
directly
afterwards
approached
to
make.
Attendance,
forbearance,
patience
with
Darcy,
was
injury
to
Wickham.
She
was
resolved
against
any
sort
of
conversation
with
him,
and
turned
away
with
a
degree
of
ill
humour
which
she
could
not
wholly
surmount
even
in
speaking
to
Mr.
Bingley,
whose
blind
partiality
provoked
her.
But
Elizabeth
was
not
formed
for
ill
humour;
and
though
every
prospect
of
her
own
was
destroyed
for
the
evening,
it
could
not
dwell
long
on
her
spirits;
and
having
told
all
her
griefs
to
Charlotte
Lucas,
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
a
week,
she
was
soon
able
to
make
a
voluntary
transition
to
the
oddities
of
her
cousin,
and
to
point
him
out
to
her
particular
notice.
The
first
two
dances,
however,
brought
a
return
of
distress;
they
were
dances
of
mortification.
Mr.
Collins,
awkward
and
solemn,
apologising
instead
of
attending,
and
often
moving
wrong
without
being
aware
of
it,
gave
her
all
the
shame
and
misery
which
a
disagreeable
partner
for
a
couple
of
dances
can
give.
The
