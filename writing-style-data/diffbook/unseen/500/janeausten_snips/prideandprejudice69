tormenting
a
respectable
man.
I
would
rather
be
paid
the
compliment
of
being
believed
sincere.
I
thank
you
again
and
again
for
the
honour
you
have
done
me
in
your
proposals,
but
to
accept
them
is
absolutely
impossible.
My
feelings
in
every
respect
forbid
it.
Can
I
speak
plainer?
Do
not
consider
me
now
as
an
elegant
female,
intending
to
plague
you,
but
as
a
rational
creature,
speaking
the
truth
from
her
heart."
"You
are
uniformly
charming!"
cried
he,
with
an
air
of
awkward
gallantry;
"and
I
am
persuaded
that
when
sanctioned
by
the
express
authority
of
both
your
excellent
parents,
my
proposals
will
not
fail
of
being
acceptable."
To
such
perseverance
in
wilful
self
deception
Elizabeth
would
make
no
reply,
and
immediately
and
in
silence
withdrew;
determined,
if
he
persisted
in
considering
her
repeated
refusals
as
flattering
encouragement,
to
apply
to
her
father,
whose
negative
might
be
uttered
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
decisive,
and
whose
behaviour
at
least
could
not
be
mistaken
for
the
affectation
and
coquetry
of
an
elegant
female.
Mr.
Collins
was
not
left
long
to
the
silent
contemplation
of
his
successful
love;
for
Mrs.
Bennet,
having
dawdled
about
in
the
vestibule
to
watch
for
the
end
of
the
conference,
no
sooner
saw
Elizabeth
open
the
door
and
with
quick
step
pass
her
towards
the
staircase,
than
she
entered
the
breakfast
room,
and
congratulated
both
him
and
herself
in
warm
terms
on
the
happy
prospect
of
their
nearer
connection.
Mr.
Collins
received
and
returned
these
felicitations
with
equal
pleasure,
and
then
proceeded
to
relate
the
particulars
of
their
interview,
with
the
result
of
which
he
trusted
he
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied,
since
the
refusal
which
his
cousin
had
steadfastly
given
him
would
naturally
flow
from
her
bashful
modesty
and
the
genuine
delicacy
of
her
character.
This
information,
however,
startled
Mrs.
Bennet;
she
would
have
been
glad
to
be
equally
satisfied
that
her
daughter
had
meant
to
encourage
him
by
protesting
against
his
proposals,
but
she
dared
not
believe
it,
and
could
not
help
saying
so.
"But,
depend
upon
it,
Mr.
Collins,"
she
added,
"that
Lizzy
shall
be
brought
to
reason.
I
will
speak
to
her
about
it
directly.
She
is
a
very
headstrong,
foolish
girl,
and
does
not
know
her
own
interest
but
I
will
make
her
know
it."
"Pardon
me
for
interrupting
you,
madam,"
cried
Mr.
Collins;
"but
if
she
is
really
headstrong
and
foolish,
I
know
not
whether
she
would
altogether
be
a
very
desirable
wife
to
a
man
in
my
situation,
who
naturally
looks
for
happiness
in
the
marriage
state.
If
therefore
she
actually
persists
in
rejecting
my
suit,
perhaps
it
were
better
not
to
force
her
into
accepting
me,
because
if
liable
to
such
defects
of
temper,
she
could
not
contribute
much
to
my
felicity."
"Sir,
you
quite
misunderstand
me,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet,
alarmed.
"Lizzy
is
only
headstrong
in
such
matters
as
these.
In
everything
else
she
is
as
good
natured
a
girl
as
ever
lived.
I
will
