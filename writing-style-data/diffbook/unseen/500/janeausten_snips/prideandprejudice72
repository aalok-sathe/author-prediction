hold
your
tongues,
and
let
me
and
Mr.
Collins
have
a
little
conversation
together."
Elizabeth
passed
quietly
out
of
the
room,
Jane
and
Kitty
followed,
but
Lydia
stood
her
ground,
determined
to
hear
all
she
could;
and
Charlotte,
detained
first
by
the
civility
of
Mr.
Collins,
whose
inquiries
after
herself
and
all
her
family
were
very
minute,
and
then
by
a
little
curiosity,
satisfied
herself
with
walking
to
the
window
and
pretending
not
to
hear.
In
a
doleful
voice
Mrs.
Bennet
began
the
projected
conversation:
"Oh!
Mr.
Collins!"
"My
dear
madam,"
replied
he,
"let
us
be
for
ever
silent
on
this
point.
Far
be
it
from
me,"
he
presently
continued,
in
a
voice
that
marked
his
displeasure,
"to
resent
the
behaviour
of
your
daughter.
Resignation
to
inevitable
evils
is
the
duty
of
us
all;
the
peculiar
duty
of
a
young
man
who
has
been
so
fortunate
as
I
have
been
in
early
preferment;
and
I
trust
I
am
resigned.
Perhaps
not
the
less
so
from
feeling
a
doubt
of
my
positive
happiness
had
my
fair
cousin
honoured
me
with
her
hand;
for
I
have
often
observed
that
resignation
is
never
so
perfect
as
when
the
blessing
denied
begins
to
lose
somewhat
of
its
value
in
our
estimation.
You
will
not,
I
hope,
consider
me
as
showing
any
disrespect
to
your
family,
my
dear
madam,
by
thus
withdrawing
my
pretensions
to
your
daughter's
favour,
without
having
paid
yourself
and
Mr.
Bennet
the
compliment
of
requesting
you
to
interpose
your
authority
in
my
behalf.
My
conduct
may,
I
fear,
be
objectionable
in
having
accepted
my
dismission
from
your
daughter's
lips
instead
of
your
own.
But
we
are
all
liable
to
error.
I
have
certainly
meant
well
through
the
whole
affair.
My
object
has
been
to
secure
an
amiable
companion
for
myself,
with
due
consideration
for
the
advantage
of
all
your
family,
and
if
my
manner
has
been
at
all
reprehensible,
I
here
beg
leave
to
apologise."
The
discussion
of
Mr.
Collins's
offer
was
now
nearly
at
an
end,
and
Elizabeth
had
only
to
suffer
from
the
uncomfortable
feelings
necessarily
attending
it,
and
occasionally
from
some
peevish
allusions
of
her
mother.
As
for
the
gentleman
himself,
his
feelings
were
chiefly
expressed,
not
by
embarrassment
or
dejection,
or
by
trying
to
avoid
her,
but
by
stiffness
of
manner
and
resentful
silence.
He
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
her,
and
the
assiduous
attentions
which
he
had
been
so
sensible
of
himself
were
transferred
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
Miss
Lucas,
whose
civility
in
listening
to
him
was
a
seasonable
relief
to
them
all,
and
especially
to
her
friend.
The
morrow
produced
no
abatement
of
Mrs.
Bennet's
ill
humour
or
ill
health.
Mr.
Collins
was
also
in
the
same
state
of
angry
pride.
Elizabeth
had
hoped
that
his
resentment
might
shorten
his
visit,
but
his
plan
did
not
appear
in
the
least
affected
by
it.
He
was
always
to
have
gone
on
Saturday,
and
to
Saturday
he
meant
to
stay.
After
breakfast,
the
girls
walked
