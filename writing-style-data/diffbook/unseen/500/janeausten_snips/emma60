the
lovers.
They
might
advance
rapidly
if
they
would,
however;
they
must
advance
somehow
or
other
whether
they
would
or
no.
She
hardly
wished
to
have
more
leisure
for
them.
There
are
people,
who
the
more
you
do
for
them,
the
less
they
will
do
for
themselves.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley,
from
having
been
longer
than
usual
absent
from
Surry,
were
exciting
of
course
rather
more
than
the
usual
interest.
Till
this
year,
every
long
vacation
since
their
marriage
had
been
divided
between
Hartfield
and
Donwell
Abbey;
but
all
the
holidays
of
this
autumn
had
been
given
to
sea
bathing
for
the
children,
and
it
was
therefore
many
months
since
they
had
been
seen
in
a
regular
way
by
their
Surry
connexions,
or
seen
at
all
by
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
could
not
be
induced
to
get
so
far
as
London,
even
for
poor
Isabella's
sake;
and
who
consequently
was
now
most
nervously
and
apprehensively
happy
in
forestalling
this
too
short
visit.
He
thought
much
of
the
evils
of
the
journey
for
her,
and
not
a
little
of
the
fatigues
of
his
own
horses
and
coachman
who
were
to
bring
some
of
the
party
the
last
half
of
the
way;
but
his
alarms
were
needless;
the
sixteen
miles
being
happily
accomplished,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley,
their
five
children,
and
a
competent
number
of
nursery
maids,
all
reaching
Hartfield
in
safety.
The
bustle
and
joy
of
such
an
arrival,
the
many
to
be
talked
to,
welcomed,
encouraged,
and
variously
dispersed
and
disposed
of,
produced
a
noise
and
confusion
which
his
nerves
could
not
have
borne
under
any
other
cause,
nor
have
endured
much
longer
even
for
this;
but
the
ways
of
Hartfield
and
the
feelings
of
her
father
were
so
respected
by
Mrs.
John
Knightley,
that
in
spite
of
maternal
solicitude
for
the
immediate
enjoyment
of
her
little
ones,
and
for
their
having
instantly
all
the
liberty
and
attendance,
all
the
eating
and
drinking,
and
sleeping
and
playing,
which
they
could
possibly
wish
for,
without
the
smallest
delay,
the
children
were
never
allowed
to
be
long
a
disturbance
to
him,
either
in
themselves
or
in
any
restless
attendance
on
them.
Mrs.
John
Knightley
was
a
pretty,
elegant
little
woman,
of
gentle,
quiet
manners,
and
a
disposition
remarkably
amiable
and
affectionate;
wrapt
up
in
her
family;
a
devoted
wife,
a
doating
mother,
and
so
tenderly
attached
to
her
father
and
sister
that,
but
for
these
higher
ties,
a
warmer
love
might
have
seemed
impossible.
She
could
never
see
a
fault
in
any
of
them.
She
was
not
a
woman
of
strong
understanding
or
any
quickness;
and
with
this
resemblance
of
her
father,
she
inherited
also
much
of
his
constitution;
was
delicate
in
her
own
health,
over
careful
of
that
of
her
children,
had
many
fears
and
many
nerves,
and
was
as
fond
of
her
own
Mr.
Wingfield
in
town
as
her
father
could
be
of
Mr.
Perry.
They
were
alike
too,
in
a
general
benevolence
of
temper,
and
a
strong
