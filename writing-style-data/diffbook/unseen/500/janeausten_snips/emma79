I
do:
but
she
does
not
know
the
parties
so
well
as
I
do.
The
case,
you
see,
is
(but
this
is
quite
between
ourselves:
I
did
not
mention
a
syllable
of
it
in
the
other
room.
There
are
secrets
in
all
families,
you
know)
The
case
is,
that
a
party
of
friends
are
invited
to
pay
a
visit
at
Enscombe
in
January;
and
that
Frank's
coming
depends
upon
their
being
put
off.
If
they
are
not
put
off,
he
cannot
stir.
But
I
know
they
will,
because
it
is
a
family
that
a
certain
lady,
of
some
consequence,
at
Enscombe,
has
a
particular
dislike
to:
and
though
it
is
thought
necessary
to
invite
them
once
in
two
or
three
years,
they
always
are
put
off
when
it
comes
to
the
point.
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
the
issue.
I
am
as
confident
of
seeing
Frank
here
before
the
middle
of
January,
as
I
am
of
being
here
myself:
but
your
good
friend
there
(nodding
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
table)
has
so
few
vagaries
herself,
and
has
been
so
little
used
to
them
at
Hartfield,
that
she
cannot
calculate
on
their
effects,
as
I
have
been
long
in
the
practice
of
doing."
"I
am
sorry
there
should
be
any
thing
like
doubt
in
the
case,"
replied
Emma;
"but
am
disposed
to
side
with
you,
Mr.
Weston.
If
you
think
he
will
come,
I
shall
think
so
too;
for
you
know
Enscombe."
"Yes
I
have
some
right
to
that
knowledge;
though
I
have
never
been
at
the
place
in
my
life.
She
is
an
odd
woman!
But
I
never
allow
myself
to
speak
ill
of
her,
on
Frank's
account;
for
I
do
believe
her
to
be
very
fond
of
him.
I
used
to
think
she
was
not
capable
of
being
fond
of
any
body,
except
herself:
but
she
has
always
been
kind
to
him
(in
her
way
allowing
for
little
whims
and
caprices,
and
expecting
every
thing
to
be
as
she
likes).
And
it
is
no
small
credit,
in
my
opinion,
to
him,
that
he
should
excite
such
an
affection;
for,
though
I
would
not
say
it
to
any
body
else,
she
has
no
more
heart
than
a
stone
to
people
in
general;
and
the
devil
of
a
temper."
Emma
liked
the
subject
so
well,
that
she
began
upon
it,
to
Mrs.
Weston,
very
soon
after
their
moving
into
the
drawing
room:
wishing
her
joy
yet
observing,
that
she
knew
the
first
meeting
must
be
rather
alarming.
Mrs.
Weston
agreed
to
it;
but
added,
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
be
secure
of
undergoing
the
anxiety
of
a
first
meeting
at
the
time
talked
of:
"for
I
cannot
depend
upon
his
coming.
I
cannot
be
so
sanguine
as
Mr.
Weston.
I
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
will
all
end
in
nothing.
Mr.
Weston,
I
dare
say,
has
been
telling
you
exactly
how
the
matter
stands?"
"Yes
it
seems
to
depend
upon
nothing
but
the
ill
