one
feels
the
loss
of
friends
so
much
as
I
do.
But
I
am
particularly
attached
to
these
young
men,
and
know
them
to
be
so
much
attached
to
me!
They
were
excessively
sorry
to
go!
But
so
they
always
are.
The
dear
Colonel
rallied
his
spirits
tolerably
till
just
at
last;
but
Darcy
seemed
to
feel
it
most
acutely,
more,
I
think,
than
last
year.
His
attachment
to
Rosings
certainly
increases."
Mr.
Collins
had
a
compliment,
and
an
allusion
to
throw
in
here,
which
were
kindly
smiled
on
by
the
mother
and
daughter.
Lady
Catherine
observed,
after
dinner,
that
Miss
Bennet
seemed
out
of
spirits,
and
immediately
accounting
for
it
by
herself,
by
supposing
that
she
did
not
like
to
go
home
again
so
soon,
she
added:
"But
if
that
is
the
case,
you
must
write
to
your
mother
and
beg
that
you
may
stay
a
little
longer.
Mrs.
Collins
will
be
very
glad
of
your
company,
I
am
sure."
"I
am
much
obliged
to
your
ladyship
for
your
kind
invitation,"
replied
Elizabeth,
"but
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
accept
it.
I
must
be
in
town
next
Saturday."
"Why,
at
that
rate,
you
will
have
been
here
only
six
weeks.
I
expected
you
to
stay
two
months.
I
told
Mrs.
Collins
so
before
you
came.
There
can
be
no
occasion
for
your
going
so
soon.
Mrs.
Bennet
could
certainly
spare
you
for
another
fortnight."
"But
my
father
cannot.
He
wrote
last
week
to
hurry
my
return."
"Oh!
your
father
of
course
may
spare
you,
if
your
mother
can.
Daughters
are
never
of
so
much
consequence
to
a
father.
And
if
you
will
stay
another
month
complete,
it
will
be
in
my
power
to
take
one
of
you
as
far
as
London,
for
I
am
going
there
early
in
June,
for
a
week;
and
as
Dawson
does
not
object
to
the
barouche
box,
there
will
be
very
good
room
for
one
of
you
and
indeed,
if
the
weather
should
happen
to
be
cool,
I
should
not
object
to
taking
you
both,
as
you
are
neither
of
you
large."
"You
are
all
kindness,
madam;
but
I
believe
we
must
abide
by
our
original
plan."
Lady
Catherine
seemed
resigned.
"Mrs.
Collins,
you
must
send
a
servant
with
them.
You
know
I
always
speak
my
mind,
and
I
cannot
bear
the
idea
of
two
young
women
travelling
post
by
themselves.
It
is
highly
improper.
You
must
contrive
to
send
somebody.
I
have
the
greatest
dislike
in
the
world
to
that
sort
of
thing.
Young
women
should
always
be
properly
guarded
and
attended,
according
to
their
situation
in
life.
When
my
niece
Georgiana
went
to
Ramsgate
last
summer,
I
made
a
point
of
her
having
two
men
servants
go
with
her.
Miss
Darcy,
the
daughter
of
Mr.
Darcy,
of
Pemberley,
and
Lady
Anne,
could
not
have
appeared
with
propriety
in
a
different
manner.
I
am
excessively
attentive
to
all
those
things.
You
must
send
John
with
the
young
ladies,
Mrs.
Collins.
I
