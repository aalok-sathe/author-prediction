urged
against
my
father,
who,
though
with
some
peculiarities,
has
abilities
Mr.
Darcy
himself
need
not
disdain,
and
respectability
which
he
will
probably
never
reach."
When
she
thought
of
her
mother,
her
confidence
gave
way
a
little;
but
she
would
not
allow
that
any
objections
there
had
material
weight
with
Mr.
Darcy,
whose
pride,
she
was
convinced,
would
receive
a
deeper
wound
from
the
want
of
importance
in
his
friend's
connections,
than
from
their
want
of
sense;
and
she
was
quite
decided,
at
last,
that
he
had
been
partly
governed
by
this
worst
kind
of
pride,
and
partly
by
the
wish
of
retaining
Mr.
Bingley
for
his
sister.
The
agitation
and
tears
which
the
subject
occasioned,
brought
on
a
headache;
and
it
grew
so
much
worse
towards
the
evening,
that,
added
to
her
unwillingness
to
see
Mr.
Darcy,
it
determined
her
not
to
attend
her
cousins
to
Rosings,
where
they
were
engaged
to
drink
tea.
Mrs.
Collins,
seeing
that
she
was
really
unwell,
did
not
press
her
to
go
and
as
much
as
possible
prevented
her
husband
from
pressing
her;
but
Mr.
Collins
could
not
conceal
his
apprehension
of
Lady
Catherine's
being
rather
displeased
by
her
staying
at
home.
When
they
were
gone,
Elizabeth,
as
if
intending
to
exasperate
herself
as
much
as
possible
against
Mr.
Darcy,
chose
for
her
employment
the
examination
of
all
the
letters
which
Jane
had
written
to
her
since
her
being
in
Kent.
They
contained
no
actual
complaint,
nor
was
there
any
revival
of
past
occurrences,
or
any
communication
of
present
suffering.
But
in
all,
and
in
almost
every
line
of
each,
there
was
a
want
of
that
cheerfulness
which
had
been
used
to
characterise
her
style,
and
which,
proceeding
from
the
serenity
of
a
mind
at
ease
with
itself
and
kindly
disposed
towards
everyone,
had
been
scarcely
ever
clouded.
Elizabeth
noticed
every
sentence
conveying
the
idea
of
uneasiness,
with
an
attention
which
it
had
hardly
received
on
the
first
perusal.
Mr.
Darcy's
shameful
boast
of
what
misery
he
had
been
able
to
inflict,
gave
her
a
keener
sense
of
her
sister's
sufferings.
It
was
some
consolation
to
think
that
his
visit
to
Rosings
was
to
end
on
the
day
after
the
next
and,
a
still
greater,
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
she
should
herself
be
with
Jane
again,
and
enabled
to
contribute
to
the
recovery
of
her
spirits,
by
all
that
affection
could
do.
She
could
not
think
of
Darcy's
leaving
Kent
without
remembering
that
his
cousin
was
to
go
with
him;
but
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
had
made
it
clear
that
he
had
no
intentions
at
all,
and
agreeable
as
he
was,
she
did
not
mean
to
be
unhappy
about
him.
While
settling
this
point,
she
was
suddenly
roused
by
the
sound
of
the
door
bell,
and
her
spirits
were
a
little
fluttered
by
the
idea
of
its
being
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
himself,
who
had
once
before
called
late
in
the
evening,
and
might
now
come
to
inquire
particularly
after
her.
But
this
idea
was
