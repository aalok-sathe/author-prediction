the
new
instrument.
"For
my
companion
tells
me,"
said
she,
"that
I
absolutely
promised
Miss
Bates
last
night,
that
I
would
come
this
morning.
I
was
not
aware
of
it
myself.
I
did
not
know
that
I
had
fixed
a
day,
but
as
he
says
I
did,
I
am
going
now."
"And
while
Mrs.
Weston
pays
her
visit,
I
may
be
allowed,
I
hope,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
"to
join
your
party
and
wait
for
her
at
Hartfield
if
you
are
going
home."
Mrs.
Weston
was
disappointed.
"I
thought
you
meant
to
go
with
me.
They
would
be
very
much
pleased."
"Me!
I
should
be
quite
in
the
way.
But,
perhaps
I
may
be
equally
in
the
way
here.
Miss
Woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
did
not
want
me.
My
aunt
always
sends
me
off
when
she
is
shopping.
She
says
I
fidget
her
to
death;
and
Miss
Woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
could
almost
say
the
same.
What
am
I
to
do?"
"I
am
here
on
no
business
of
my
own,"
said
Emma;
"I
am
only
waiting
for
my
friend.
She
will
probably
have
soon
done,
and
then
we
shall
go
home.
But
you
had
better
go
with
Mrs.
Weston
and
hear
the
instrument."
"Well
if
you
advise
it.
But
(with
a
smile)
if
Colonel
Campbell
should
have
employed
a
careless
friend,
and
if
it
should
prove
to
have
an
indifferent
tone
what
shall
I
say?
I
shall
be
no
support
to
Mrs.
Weston.
She
might
do
very
well
by
herself.
A
disagreeable
truth
would
be
palatable
through
her
lips,
but
I
am
the
wretchedest
being
in
the
world
at
a
civil
falsehood."
"I
do
not
believe
any
such
thing,"
replied
Emma.
"I
am
persuaded
that
you
can
be
as
insincere
as
your
neighbours,
when
it
is
necessary;
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
the
instrument
is
indifferent.
Quite
otherwise
indeed,
if
I
understood
Miss
Fairfax's
opinion
last
night."
"Do
come
with
me,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"if
it
be
not
very
disagreeable
to
you.
It
need
not
detain
us
long.
We
will
go
to
Hartfield
afterwards.
We
will
follow
them
to
Hartfield.
I
really
wish
you
to
call
with
me.
It
will
be
felt
so
great
an
attention!
and
I
always
thought
you
meant
it."
He
could
say
no
more;
and
with
the
hope
of
Hartfield
to
reward
him,
returned
with
Mrs.
Weston
to
Mrs.
Bates's
door.
Emma
watched
them
in,
and
then
joined
Harriet
at
the
interesting
counter,
trying,
with
all
the
force
of
her
own
mind,
to
convince
her
that
if
she
wanted
plain
muslin
it
was
of
no
use
to
look
at
figured;
and
that
a
blue
ribbon,
be
it
ever
so
beautiful,
would
still
never
match
her
yellow
pattern.
At
last
it
was
all
settled,
even
to
the
destination
of
the
parcel.
"Should
I
send
it
to
Mrs.
Goddard's,
ma'am?"
asked
Mrs.
Ford.
"Yes
no
yes,
to
Mrs.
Goddard's.
Only
my
pattern
gown
is
at
Hartfield.
No,
you
shall
send
it
to
Hartfield,
if
you
