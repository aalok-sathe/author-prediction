so
thin
and
so
small.
There
was
neither
in
figure
nor
face
any
likeness
between
the
ladies.
Miss
de
Bourgh
was
pale
and
sickly;
her
features,
though
not
plain,
were
insignificant;
and
she
spoke
very
little,
except
in
a
low
voice,
to
Mrs.
Jenkinson,
in
whose
appearance
there
was
nothing
remarkable,
and
who
was
entirely
engaged
in
listening
to
what
she
said,
and
placing
a
screen
in
the
proper
direction
before
her
eyes.
After
sitting
a
few
minutes,
they
were
all
sent
to
one
of
the
windows
to
admire
the
view,
Mr.
Collins
attending
them
to
point
out
its
beauties,
and
Lady
Catherine
kindly
informing
them
that
it
was
much
better
worth
looking
at
in
the
summer.
The
dinner
was
exceedingly
handsome,
and
there
were
all
the
servants
and
all
the
articles
of
plate
which
Mr.
Collins
had
promised;
and,
as
he
had
likewise
foretold,
he
took
his
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
table,
by
her
ladyship's
desire,
and
looked
as
if
he
felt
that
life
could
furnish
nothing
greater.
He
carved,
and
ate,
and
praised
with
delighted
alacrity;
and
every
dish
was
commended,
first
by
him
and
then
by
Sir
William,
who
was
now
enough
recovered
to
echo
whatever
his
son
in
law
said,
in
a
manner
which
Elizabeth
wondered
Lady
Catherine
could
bear.
But
Lady
Catherine
seemed
gratified
by
their
excessive
admiration,
and
gave
most
gracious
smiles,
especially
when
any
dish
on
the
table
proved
a
novelty
to
them.
The
party
did
not
supply
much
conversation.
Elizabeth
was
ready
to
speak
whenever
there
was
an
opening,
but
she
was
seated
between
Charlotte
and
Miss
de
Bourgh
the
former
of
whom
was
engaged
in
listening
to
Lady
Catherine,
and
the
latter
said
not
a
word
to
her
all
dinner
time.
Mrs.
Jenkinson
was
chiefly
employed
in
watching
how
little
Miss
de
Bourgh
ate,
pressing
her
to
try
some
other
dish,
and
fearing
she
was
indisposed.
Maria
thought
speaking
out
of
the
question,
and
the
gentlemen
did
nothing
but
eat
and
admire.
When
the
ladies
returned
to
the
drawing
room,
there
was
little
to
be
done
but
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
talk,
which
she
did
without
any
intermission
till
coffee
came
in,
delivering
her
opinion
on
every
subject
in
so
decisive
a
manner,
as
proved
that
she
was
not
used
to
have
her
judgement
controverted.
She
inquired
into
Charlotte's
domestic
concerns
familiarly
and
minutely,
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
advice
as
to
the
management
of
them
all;
told
her
how
everything
ought
to
be
regulated
in
so
small
a
family
as
hers,
and
instructed
her
as
to
the
care
of
her
cows
and
her
poultry.
Elizabeth
found
that
nothing
was
beneath
this
great
lady's
attention,
which
could
furnish
her
with
an
occasion
of
dictating
to
others.
In
the
intervals
of
her
discourse
with
Mrs.
Collins,
she
addressed
a
variety
of
questions
to
Maria
and
Elizabeth,
but
especially
to
the
latter,
of
whose
connections
she
knew
the
least,
and
who
she
observed
to
Mrs.
Collins
was
a
very
genteel,
