her
age!
Her
performance
on
the
pianoforte
is
exquisite."
"It
is
amazing
to
me,"
said
Bingley,
"how
young
ladies
can
have
patience
to
be
so
very
accomplished
as
they
all
are."
"All
young
ladies
accomplished!
My
dear
Charles,
what
do
you
mean?"
"Yes,
all
of
them,
I
think.
They
all
paint
tables,
cover
screens,
and
net
purses.
I
scarcely
know
anyone
who
cannot
do
all
this,
and
I
am
sure
I
never
heard
a
young
lady
spoken
of
for
the
first
time,
without
being
informed
that
she
was
very
accomplished."
"Your
list
of
the
common
extent
of
accomplishments,"
said
Darcy,
"has
too
much
truth.
The
word
is
applied
to
many
a
woman
who
deserves
it
no
otherwise
than
by
netting
a
purse
or
covering
a
screen.
But
I
am
very
far
from
agreeing
with
you
in
your
estimation
of
ladies
in
general.
I
cannot
boast
of
knowing
more
than
half
a
dozen,
in
the
whole
range
of
my
acquaintance,
that
are
really
accomplished."
"Nor
I,
I
am
sure,"
said
Miss
Bingley.
"Then,"
observed
Elizabeth,
"you
must
comprehend
a
great
deal
in
your
idea
of
an
accomplished
woman."
"Yes,
I
do
comprehend
a
great
deal
in
it."
"Oh!
certainly,"
cried
his
faithful
assistant,
"no
one
can
be
really
esteemed
accomplished
who
does
not
greatly
surpass
what
is
usually
met
with.
A
woman
must
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
music,
singing,
drawing,
dancing,
and
the
modern
languages,
to
deserve
the
word;
and
besides
all
this,
she
must
possess
a
certain
something
in
her
air
and
manner
of
walking,
the
tone
of
her
voice,
her
address
and
expressions,
or
the
word
will
be
but
half
deserved."
"All
this
she
must
possess,"
added
Darcy,
"and
to
all
this
she
must
yet
add
something
more
substantial,
in
the
improvement
of
her
mind
by
extensive
reading."
"I
am
no
longer
surprised
at
your
knowing
only
six
accomplished
women.
I
rather
wonder
now
at
your
knowing
any."
"Are
you
so
severe
upon
your
own
sex
as
to
doubt
the
possibility
of
all
this?"
"I
never
saw
such
a
woman.
I
never
saw
such
capacity,
and
taste,
and
application,
and
elegance,
as
you
describe
united."
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
both
cried
out
against
the
injustice
of
her
implied
doubt,
and
were
both
protesting
that
they
knew
many
women
who
answered
this
description,
when
Mr.
Hurst
called
them
to
order,
with
bitter
complaints
of
their
inattention
to
what
was
going
forward.
As
all
conversation
was
thereby
at
an
end,
Elizabeth
soon
afterwards
left
the
room.
"Elizabeth
Bennet,"
said
Miss
Bingley,
when
the
door
was
closed
on
her,
"is
one
of
those
young
ladies
who
seek
to
recommend
themselves
to
the
other
sex
by
undervaluing
their
own;
and
with
many
men,
I
dare
say,
it
succeeds.
But,
in
my
opinion,
it
is
a
paltry
device,
a
very
mean
art."
"Undoubtedly,"
replied
Darcy,
to
whom
this
remark
was
chiefly
addressed,
"there
is
a
meanness
in
all
the
arts
which
ladies
sometimes
condescend
to
employ
for
captivation.
Whatever
bears
affinity
to
