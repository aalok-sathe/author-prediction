creditors
in
Meryton,
of
whom
I
shall
subjoin
a
list
according
to
his
information?
He
has
given
in
all
his
debts;
I
hope
at
least
he
has
not
deceived
us.
Haggerston
has
our
directions,
and
all
will
be
completed
in
a
week.
They
will
then
join
his
regiment,
unless
they
are
first
invited
to
Longbourn;
and
I
understand
from
Mrs.
Gardiner,
that
my
niece
is
very
desirous
of
seeing
you
all
before
she
leaves
the
South.
She
is
well,
and
begs
to
be
dutifully
remembered
to
you
and
her
mother.
Yours,
etc.,
"E.
GARDINER."
Mr.
Bennet
and
his
daughters
saw
all
the
advantages
of
Wickham's
removal
from
the
shire
as
clearly
as
Mr.
Gardiner
could
do.
But
Mrs.
Bennet
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
it.
Lydia's
being
settled
in
the
North,
just
when
she
had
expected
most
pleasure
and
pride
in
her
company,
for
she
had
by
no
means
given
up
her
plan
of
their
residing
in
Hertfordshire,
was
a
severe
disappointment;
and,
besides,
it
was
such
a
pity
that
Lydia
should
be
taken
from
a
regiment
where
she
was
acquainted
with
everybody,
and
had
so
many
favourites.
"She
is
so
fond
of
Mrs.
Forster,"
said
she,
"it
will
be
quite
shocking
to
send
her
away!
And
there
are
several
of
the
young
men,
too,
that
she
likes
very
much.
The
officers
may
not
be
so
pleasant
in
General
's
regiment."
His
daughter's
request,
for
such
it
might
be
considered,
of
being
admitted
into
her
family
again
before
she
set
off
for
the
North,
received
at
first
an
absolute
negative.
But
Jane
and
Elizabeth,
who
agreed
in
wishing,
for
the
sake
of
their
sister's
feelings
and
consequence,
that
she
should
be
noticed
on
her
marriage
by
her
parents,
urged
him
so
earnestly
yet
so
rationally
and
so
mildly,
to
receive
her
and
her
husband
at
Longbourn,
as
soon
as
they
were
married,
that
he
was
prevailed
on
to
think
as
they
thought,
and
act
as
they
wished.
And
their
mother
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
would
be
able
to
show
her
married
daughter
in
the
neighbourhood
before
she
was
banished
to
the
North.
When
Mr.
Bennet
wrote
again
to
his
brother,
therefore,
he
sent
his
permission
for
them
to
come;
and
it
was
settled,
that
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
was
over,
they
should
proceed
to
Longbourn.
Elizabeth
was
surprised,
however,
that
Wickham
should
consent
to
such
a
scheme,
and
had
she
consulted
only
her
own
inclination,
any
meeting
with
him
would
have
been
the
last
object
of
her
wishes.
Their
sister's
wedding
day
arrived;
and
Jane
and
Elizabeth
felt
for
her
probably
more
than
she
felt
for
herself.
The
carriage
was
sent
to
meet
them
at
,
and
they
were
to
return
in
it
by
dinner
time.
Their
arrival
was
dreaded
by
the
elder
Miss
Bennets,
and
Jane
more
especially,
who
gave
Lydia
the
feelings
which
would
have
attended
herself,
had
she
been
the
culprit,
and
was
wretched
in
the
thought
of
what
her
sister
must
