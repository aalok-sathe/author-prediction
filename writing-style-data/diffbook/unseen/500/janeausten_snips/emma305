Knightley!
Can
you
explain
it?"
Emma
amused
herself
by
protesting
that
it
was
very
extraordinary,
indeed,
and
that
she
had
not
a
syllable
to
say
for
him.
"I
cannot
imagine,"
said
Mrs.
Elton,
(feeling
the
indignity
as
a
wife
ought
to
do,)
"I
cannot
imagine
how
he
could
do
such
a
thing
by
you,
of
all
people
in
the
world!
The
very
last
person
whom
one
should
expect
to
be
forgotten!
My
dear
Mr.
E.,
he
must
have
left
a
message
for
you,
I
am
sure
he
must.
Not
even
Knightley
could
be
so
very
eccentric;
and
his
servants
forgot
it.
Depend
upon
it,
that
was
the
case:
and
very
likely
to
happen
with
the
Donwell
servants,
who
are
all,
I
have
often
observed,
extremely
awkward
and
remiss.
I
am
sure
I
would
not
have
such
a
creature
as
his
Harry
stand
at
our
sideboard
for
any
consideration.
And
as
for
Mrs.
Hodges,
Wright
holds
her
very
cheap
indeed.
She
promised
Wright
a
receipt,
and
never
sent
it."
"I
met
William
Larkins,"
continued
Mr.
Elton,
"as
I
got
near
the
house,
and
he
told
me
I
should
not
find
his
master
at
home,
but
I
did
not
believe
him.
William
seemed
rather
out
of
humour.
He
did
not
know
what
was
come
to
his
master
lately,
he
said,
but
he
could
hardly
ever
get
the
speech
of
him.
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
William's
wants,
but
it
really
is
of
very
great
importance
that
I
should
see
Knightley
to
day;
and
it
becomes
a
matter,
therefore,
of
very
serious
inconvenience
that
I
should
have
had
this
hot
walk
to
no
purpose."
Emma
felt
that
she
could
not
do
better
than
go
home
directly.
In
all
probability
she
was
at
this
very
time
waited
for
there;
and
Mr.
Knightley
might
be
preserved
from
sinking
deeper
in
aggression
towards
Mr.
Elton,
if
not
towards
William
Larkins.
She
was
pleased,
on
taking
leave,
to
find
Miss
Fairfax
determined
to
attend
her
out
of
the
room,
to
go
with
her
even
downstairs;
it
gave
her
an
opportunity
which
she
immediately
made
use
of,
to
say,
"It
is
as
well,
perhaps,
that
I
have
not
had
the
possibility.
Had
you
not
been
surrounded
by
other
friends,
I
might
have
been
tempted
to
introduce
a
subject,
to
ask
questions,
to
speak
more
openly
than
might
have
been
strictly
correct.
I
feel
that
I
should
certainly
have
been
impertinent."
"Oh!"
cried
Jane,
with
a
blush
and
an
hesitation
which
Emma
thought
infinitely
more
becoming
to
her
than
all
the
elegance
of
all
her
usual
composure
"there
would
have
been
no
danger.
The
danger
would
have
been
of
my
wearying
you.
You
could
not
have
gratified
me
more
than
by
expressing
an
interest
.
Indeed,
Miss
Woodhouse,
(speaking
more
collectedly,)
with
the
consciousness
which
I
have
of
misconduct,
very
great
misconduct,
it
is
particularly
consoling
to
me
to
know
that
those
of
my
friends,
whose
good
opinion
is
most
worth
preserving,
are
not
disgusted
to
such
a
