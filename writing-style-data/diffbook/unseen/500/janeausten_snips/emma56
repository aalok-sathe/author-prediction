I
shall
not
be
a
poor
old
maid;
and
it
is
poverty
only
which
makes
celibacy
contemptible
to
a
generous
public!
A
single
woman,
with
a
very
narrow
income,
must
be
a
ridiculous,
disagreeable
old
maid!
the
proper
sport
of
boys
and
girls,
but
a
single
woman,
of
good
fortune,
is
always
respectable,
and
may
be
as
sensible
and
pleasant
as
any
body
else.
And
the
distinction
is
not
quite
so
much
against
the
candour
and
common
sense
of
the
world
as
appears
at
first;
for
a
very
narrow
income
has
a
tendency
to
contract
the
mind,
and
sour
the
temper.
Those
who
can
barely
live,
and
who
live
perforce
in
a
very
small,
and
generally
very
inferior,
society,
may
well
be
illiberal
and
cross.
This
does
not
apply,
however,
to
Miss
Bates;
she
is
only
too
good
natured
and
too
silly
to
suit
me;
but,
in
general,
she
is
very
much
to
the
taste
of
every
body,
though
single
and
though
poor.
Poverty
certainly
has
not
contracted
her
mind:
I
really
believe,
if
she
had
only
a
shilling
in
the
world,
she
would
be
very
likely
to
give
away
sixpence
of
it;
and
nobody
is
afraid
of
her:
that
is
a
great
charm."
"Dear
me!
but
what
shall
you
do?
how
shall
you
employ
yourself
when
you
grow
old?"
"If
I
know
myself,
Harriet,
mine
is
an
active,
busy
mind,
with
a
great
many
independent
resources;
and
I
do
not
perceive
why
I
should
be
more
in
want
of
employment
at
forty
or
fifty
than
one
and
twenty.
Woman's
usual
occupations
of
hand
and
mind
will
be
as
open
to
me
then
as
they
are
now;
or
with
no
important
variation.
If
I
draw
less,
I
shall
read
more;
if
I
give
up
music,
I
shall
take
to
carpet
work.
And
as
for
objects
of
interest,
objects
for
the
affections,
which
is
in
truth
the
great
point
of
inferiority,
the
want
of
which
is
really
the
great
evil
to
be
avoided
in
not
marrying,
I
shall
be
very
well
off,
with
all
the
children
of
a
sister
I
love
so
much,
to
care
about.
There
will
be
enough
of
them,
in
all
probability,
to
supply
every
sort
of
sensation
that
declining
life
can
need.
There
will
be
enough
for
every
hope
and
every
fear;
and
though
my
attachment
to
none
can
equal
that
of
a
parent,
it
suits
my
ideas
of
comfort
better
than
what
is
warmer
and
blinder.
My
nephews
and
nieces!
I
shall
often
have
a
niece
with
me."
"Do
you
know
Miss
Bates's
niece?
That
is,
I
know
you
must
have
seen
her
a
hundred
times
but
are
you
acquainted?"
"Oh!
yes;
we
are
always
forced
to
be
acquainted
whenever
she
comes
to
Highbury.
By
the
bye,
that
is
almost
enough
to
put
one
out
of
conceit
with
a
niece.
Heaven
forbid!
at
least,
that
I
should
ever
bore
people
half
so
much
about
all
the
Knightleys
together,
as
she
does
about
Jane
Fairfax.
