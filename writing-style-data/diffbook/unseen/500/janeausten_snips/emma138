above
once
since
the
new
approach
was
made;
but
still
I
have
no
doubt
that
James
will
take
you
very
safely.
And
when
you
get
there,
you
must
tell
him
at
what
time
you
would
have
him
come
for
you
again;
and
you
had
better
name
an
early
hour.
You
will
not
like
staying
late.
You
will
get
very
tired
when
tea
is
over."
"But
you
would
not
wish
me
to
come
away
before
I
am
tired,
papa?"
"Oh!
no,
my
love;
but
you
will
soon
be
tired.
There
will
be
a
great
many
people
talking
at
once.
You
will
not
like
the
noise."
"But,
my
dear
sir,"
cried
Mr.
Weston,
"if
Emma
comes
away
early,
it
will
be
breaking
up
the
party."
"And
no
great
harm
if
it
does,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse.
"The
sooner
every
party
breaks
up,
the
better."
"But
you
do
not
consider
how
it
may
appear
to
the
Coles.
Emma's
going
away
directly
after
tea
might
be
giving
offence.
They
are
good
natured
people,
and
think
little
of
their
own
claims;
but
still
they
must
feel
that
any
body's
hurrying
away
is
no
great
compliment;
and
Miss
Woodhouse's
doing
it
would
be
more
thought
of
than
any
other
person's
in
the
room.
You
would
not
wish
to
disappoint
and
mortify
the
Coles,
I
am
sure,
sir;
friendly,
good
sort
of
people
as
ever
lived,
and
who
have
been
your
neighbours
these
ten
years."
"No,
upon
no
account
in
the
world,
Mr.
Weston;
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
reminding
me.
I
should
be
extremely
sorry
to
be
giving
them
any
pain.
I
know
what
worthy
people
they
are.
Perry
tells
me
that
Mr.
Cole
never
touches
malt
liquor.
You
would
not
think
it
to
look
at
him,
but
he
is
bilious
Mr.
Cole
is
very
bilious.
No,
I
would
not
be
the
means
of
giving
them
any
pain.
My
dear
Emma,
we
must
consider
this.
I
am
sure,
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
hurting
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole,
you
would
stay
a
little
longer
than
you
might
wish.
You
will
not
regard
being
tired.
You
will
be
perfectly
safe,
you
know,
among
your
friends."
"Oh
yes,
papa.
I
have
no
fears
at
all
for
myself;
and
I
should
have
no
scruples
of
staying
as
late
as
Mrs.
Weston,
but
on
your
account.
I
am
only
afraid
of
your
sitting
up
for
me.
I
am
not
afraid
of
your
not
being
exceedingly
comfortable
with
Mrs.
Goddard.
She
loves
piquet,
you
know;
but
when
she
is
gone
home,
I
am
afraid
you
will
be
sitting
up
by
yourself,
instead
of
going
to
bed
at
your
usual
time
and
the
idea
of
that
would
entirely
destroy
my
comfort.
You
must
promise
me
not
to
sit
up."
He
did,
on
the
condition
of
some
promises
on
her
side:
such
as
that,
if
she
came
home
cold,
she
would
be
sure
to
warm
herself
thoroughly;
if
hungry,
that
she
would
take
something
to
eat;
that
her
own
maid
should
