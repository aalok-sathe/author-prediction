walked
out
to
recover
her
spirits;
or
in
other
words,
to
dwell
without
interruption
on
those
subjects
that
must
deaden
them
more.
Mr.
Darcy's
behaviour
astonished
and
vexed
her.
"Why,
if
he
came
only
to
be
silent,
grave,
and
indifferent,"
said
she,
"did
he
come
at
all?"
She
could
settle
it
in
no
way
that
gave
her
pleasure.
"He
could
be
still
amiable,
still
pleasing,
to
my
uncle
and
aunt,
when
he
was
in
town;
and
why
not
to
me?
If
he
fears
me,
why
come
hither?
If
he
no
longer
cares
for
me,
why
silent?
Teasing,
teasing,
man!
I
will
think
no
more
about
him."
Her
resolution
was
for
a
short
time
involuntarily
kept
by
the
approach
of
her
sister,
who
joined
her
with
a
cheerful
look,
which
showed
her
better
satisfied
with
their
visitors,
than
Elizabeth.
"Now,"
said
she,
"that
this
first
meeting
is
over,
I
feel
perfectly
easy.
I
know
my
own
strength,
and
I
shall
never
be
embarrassed
again
by
his
coming.
I
am
glad
he
dines
here
on
Tuesday.
It
will
then
be
publicly
seen
that,
on
both
sides,
we
meet
only
as
common
and
indifferent
acquaintance."
"Yes,
very
indifferent
indeed,"
said
Elizabeth,
laughingly.
"Oh,
Jane,
take
care."
"My
dear
Lizzy,
you
cannot
think
me
so
weak,
as
to
be
in
danger
now?"
"I
think
you
are
in
very
great
danger
of
making
him
as
much
in
love
with
you
as
ever."
They
did
not
see
the
gentlemen
again
till
Tuesday;
and
Mrs.
Bennet,
in
the
meanwhile,
was
giving
way
to
all
the
happy
schemes,
which
the
good
humour
and
common
politeness
of
Bingley,
in
half
an
hour's
visit,
had
revived.
On
Tuesday
there
was
a
large
party
assembled
at
Longbourn;
and
the
two
who
were
most
anxiously
expected,
to
the
credit
of
their
punctuality
as
sportsmen,
were
in
very
good
time.
When
they
repaired
to
the
dining
room,
Elizabeth
eagerly
watched
to
see
whether
Bingley
would
take
the
place,
which,
in
all
their
former
parties,
had
belonged
to
him,
by
her
sister.
Her
prudent
mother,
occupied
by
the
same
ideas,
forbore
to
invite
him
to
sit
by
herself.
On
entering
the
room,
he
seemed
to
hesitate;
but
Jane
happened
to
look
round,
and
happened
to
smile:
it
was
decided.
He
placed
himself
by
her.
Elizabeth,
with
a
triumphant
sensation,
looked
towards
his
friend.
He
bore
it
with
noble
indifference,
and
she
would
have
imagined
that
Bingley
had
received
his
sanction
to
be
happy,
had
she
not
seen
his
eyes
likewise
turned
towards
Mr.
Darcy,
with
an
expression
of
half
laughing
alarm.
His
behaviour
to
her
sister
was
such,
during
dinner
time,
as
showed
an
admiration
of
her,
which,
though
more
guarded
than
formerly,
persuaded
Elizabeth,
that
if
left
wholly
to
himself,
Jane's
happiness,
and
his
own,
would
be
speedily
secured.
Though
she
dared
not
depend
upon
the
consequence,
she
yet
received
pleasure
from
observing
his
behaviour.
It
gave
her
all
the
animation
that
her
spirits
could
boast;
for
she
was
in
no
cheerful
humour.
