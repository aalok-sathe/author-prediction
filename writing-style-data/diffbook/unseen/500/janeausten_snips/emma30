day;
and
Mr.
Elton,
just
as
he
ought,
entreated
for
the
permission
of
attending
and
reading
to
them
again.
"By
all
means.
We
shall
be
most
happy
to
consider
you
as
one
of
the
party."
The
same
civilities
and
courtesies,
the
same
success
and
satisfaction,
took
place
on
the
morrow,
and
accompanied
the
whole
progress
of
the
picture,
which
was
rapid
and
happy.
Every
body
who
saw
it
was
pleased,
but
Mr.
Elton
was
in
continual
raptures,
and
defended
it
through
every
criticism.
"Miss
Woodhouse
has
given
her
friend
the
only
beauty
she
wanted,"
observed
Mrs.
Weston
to
him
not
in
the
least
suspecting
that
she
was
addressing
a
lover.
"The
expression
of
the
eye
is
most
correct,
but
Miss
Smith
has
not
those
eyebrows
and
eyelashes.
It
is
the
fault
of
her
face
that
she
has
them
not."
"Do
you
think
so?"
replied
he.
"I
cannot
agree
with
you.
It
appears
to
me
a
most
perfect
resemblance
in
every
feature.
I
never
saw
such
a
likeness
in
my
life.
We
must
allow
for
the
effect
of
shade,
you
know."
"You
have
made
her
too
tall,
Emma,"
said
Mr.
Knightley.
Emma
knew
that
she
had,
but
would
not
own
it;
and
Mr.
Elton
warmly
added,
"Oh
no!
certainly
not
too
tall;
not
in
the
least
too
tall.
Consider,
she
is
sitting
down
which
naturally
presents
a
different
which
in
short
gives
exactly
the
idea
and
the
proportions
must
be
preserved,
you
know.
Proportions,
fore
shortening.
Oh
no!
it
gives
one
exactly
the
idea
of
such
a
height
as
Miss
Smith's.
Exactly
so
indeed!"
"It
is
very
pretty,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse.
"So
prettily
done!
Just
as
your
drawings
always
are,
my
dear.
I
do
not
know
any
body
who
draws
so
well
as
you
do.
The
only
thing
I
do
not
thoroughly
like
is,
that
she
seems
to
be
sitting
out
of
doors,
with
only
a
little
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
it
makes
one
think
she
must
catch
cold."
"But,
my
dear
papa,
it
is
supposed
to
be
summer;
a
warm
day
in
summer.
Look
at
the
tree."
"But
it
is
never
safe
to
sit
out
of
doors,
my
dear."
"You,
sir,
may
say
any
thing,"
cried
Mr.
Elton,
"but
I
must
confess
that
I
regard
it
as
a
most
happy
thought,
the
placing
of
Miss
Smith
out
of
doors;
and
the
tree
is
touched
with
such
inimitable
spirit!
Any
other
situation
would
have
been
much
less
in
character.
The
naivete
of
Miss
Smith's
manners
and
altogether
Oh,
it
is
most
admirable!
I
cannot
keep
my
eyes
from
it.
I
never
saw
such
a
likeness."
The
next
thing
wanted
was
to
get
the
picture
framed;
and
here
were
a
few
difficulties.
It
must
be
done
directly;
it
must
be
done
in
London;
the
order
must
go
through
the
hands
of
some
intelligent
person
whose
taste
could
be
depended
on;
and
Isabella,
the
usual
doer
of
all
commissions,
must
not
be
applied
to,
because
it
was
December,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
