every
thing.
I
have
some
notion
of
putting
such
a
trimming
as
this
to
my
white
and
silver
poplin.
Do
you
think
it
will
look
well?"
The
whole
party
were
but
just
reassembled
in
the
drawing
room
when
Mr.
Weston
made
his
appearance
among
them.
He
had
returned
to
a
late
dinner,
and
walked
to
Hartfield
as
soon
as
it
was
over.
He
had
been
too
much
expected
by
the
best
judges,
for
surprize
but
there
was
great
joy.
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
almost
as
glad
to
see
him
now,
as
he
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
before.
John
Knightley
only
was
in
mute
astonishment.
That
a
man
who
might
have
spent
his
evening
quietly
at
home
after
a
day
of
business
in
London,
should
set
off
again,
and
walk
half
a
mile
to
another
man's
house,
for
the
sake
of
being
in
mixed
company
till
bed
time,
of
finishing
his
day
in
the
efforts
of
civility
and
the
noise
of
numbers,
was
a
circumstance
to
strike
him
deeply.
A
man
who
had
been
in
motion
since
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning,
and
might
now
have
been
still,
who
had
been
long
talking,
and
might
have
been
silent,
who
had
been
in
more
than
one
crowd,
and
might
have
been
alone!
Such
a
man,
to
quit
the
tranquillity
and
independence
of
his
own
fireside,
and
on
the
evening
of
a
cold
sleety
April
day
rush
out
again
into
the
world!
Could
he
by
a
touch
of
his
finger
have
instantly
taken
back
his
wife,
there
would
have
been
a
motive;
but
his
coming
would
probably
prolong
rather
than
break
up
the
party.
John
Knightley
looked
at
him
with
amazement,
then
shrugged
his
shoulders,
and
said,
"I
could
not
have
believed
it
even
of
him."
Mr.
Weston
meanwhile,
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
the
indignation
he
was
exciting,
happy
and
cheerful
as
usual,
and
with
all
the
right
of
being
principal
talker,
which
a
day
spent
anywhere
from
home
confers,
was
making
himself
agreeable
among
the
rest;
and
having
satisfied
the
inquiries
of
his
wife
as
to
his
dinner,
convincing
her
that
none
of
all
her
careful
directions
to
the
servants
had
been
forgotten,
and
spread
abroad
what
public
news
he
had
heard,
was
proceeding
to
a
family
communication,
which,
though
principally
addressed
to
Mrs.
Weston,
he
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
being
highly
interesting
to
every
body
in
the
room.
He
gave
her
a
letter,
it
was
from
Frank,
and
to
herself;
he
had
met
with
it
in
his
way,
and
had
taken
the
liberty
of
opening
it.
"Read
it,
read
it,"
said
he,
"it
will
give
you
pleasure;
only
a
few
lines
will
not
take
you
long;
read
it
to
Emma."
The
two
ladies
looked
over
it
together;
and
he
sat
smiling
and
talking
to
them
the
whole
time,
in
a
voice
a
little
subdued,
but
very
audible
to
every
body.
"Well,
he
is
coming,
you
see;
good
news,
I
think.
Well,
what
do
you
say
to
it?
I
