effect
of
what
he
heard,
on
his
feelings.
The
delightful
assurance
of
her
total
indifference
towards
Frank
Churchill,
of
her
having
a
heart
completely
disengaged
from
him,
had
given
birth
to
the
hope,
that,
in
time,
he
might
gain
her
affection
himself;
but
it
had
been
no
present
hope
he
had
only,
in
the
momentary
conquest
of
eagerness
over
judgment,
aspired
to
be
told
that
she
did
not
forbid
his
attempt
to
attach
her.
The
superior
hopes
which
gradually
opened
were
so
much
the
more
enchanting.
The
affection,
which
he
had
been
asking
to
be
allowed
to
create,
if
he
could,
was
already
his!
Within
half
an
hour,
he
had
passed
from
a
thoroughly
distressed
state
of
mind,
to
something
so
like
perfect
happiness,
that
it
could
bear
no
other
name.
Her
change
was
equal.
This
one
half
hour
had
given
to
each
the
same
precious
certainty
of
being
beloved,
had
cleared
from
each
the
same
degree
of
ignorance,
jealousy,
or
distrust.
On
his
side,
there
had
been
a
long
standing
jealousy,
old
as
the
arrival,
or
even
the
expectation,
of
Frank
Churchill.
He
had
been
in
love
with
Emma,
and
jealous
of
Frank
Churchill,
from
about
the
same
period,
one
sentiment
having
probably
enlightened
him
as
to
the
other.
It
was
his
jealousy
of
Frank
Churchill
that
had
taken
him
from
the
country.
The
Box
Hill
party
had
decided
him
on
going
away.
He
would
save
himself
from
witnessing
again
such
permitted,
encouraged
attentions.
He
had
gone
to
learn
to
be
indifferent.
But
he
had
gone
to
a
wrong
place.
There
was
too
much
domestic
happiness
in
his
brother's
house;
woman
wore
too
amiable
a
form
in
it;
Isabella
was
too
much
like
Emma
differing
only
in
those
striking
inferiorities,
which
always
brought
the
other
in
brilliancy
before
him,
for
much
to
have
been
done,
even
had
his
time
been
longer.
He
had
stayed
on,
however,
vigorously,
day
after
day
till
this
very
morning's
post
had
conveyed
the
history
of
Jane
Fairfax.
Then,
with
the
gladness
which
must
be
felt,
nay,
which
he
did
not
scruple
to
feel,
having
never
believed
Frank
Churchill
to
be
at
all
deserving
Emma,
was
there
so
much
fond
solicitude,
so
much
keen
anxiety
for
her,
that
he
could
stay
no
longer.
He
had
ridden
home
through
the
rain;
and
had
walked
up
directly
after
dinner,
to
see
how
this
sweetest
and
best
of
all
creatures,
faultless
in
spite
of
all
her
faults,
bore
the
discovery.
He
had
found
her
agitated
and
low.
Frank
Churchill
was
a
villain.
He
heard
her
declare
that
she
had
never
loved
him.
Frank
Churchill's
character
was
not
desperate.
She
was
his
own
Emma,
by
hand
and
word,
when
they
returned
into
the
house;
and
if
he
could
have
thought
of
Frank
Churchill
then,
he
might
have
deemed
him
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow.
What
totally
different
feelings
did
Emma
take
back
into
the
house
from
what
she
had
brought
out!
she
had
then
been
only
daring
to
