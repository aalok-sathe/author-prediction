their
whims.
Respect
for
right
conduct
is
felt
by
every
body.
If
he
would
act
in
this
sort
of
manner,
on
principle,
consistently,
regularly,
their
little
minds
would
bend
to
his."
"I
rather
doubt
that.
You
are
very
fond
of
bending
little
minds;
but
where
little
minds
belong
to
rich
people
in
authority,
I
think
they
have
a
knack
of
swelling
out,
till
they
are
quite
as
unmanageable
as
great
ones.
I
can
imagine,
that
if
you,
as
you
are,
Mr.
Knightley,
were
to
be
transported
and
placed
all
at
once
in
Mr.
Frank
Churchill's
situation,
you
would
be
able
to
say
and
do
just
what
you
have
been
recommending
for
him;
and
it
might
have
a
very
good
effect.
The
Churchills
might
not
have
a
word
to
say
in
return;
but
then,
you
would
have
no
habits
of
early
obedience
and
long
observance
to
break
through.
To
him
who
has,
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
burst
forth
at
once
into
perfect
independence,
and
set
all
their
claims
on
his
gratitude
and
regard
at
nought.
He
may
have
as
strong
a
sense
of
what
would
be
right,
as
you
can
have,
without
being
so
equal,
under
particular
circumstances,
to
act
up
to
it."
"Then
it
would
not
be
so
strong
a
sense.
If
it
failed
to
produce
equal
exertion,
it
could
not
be
an
equal
conviction."
"Oh,
the
difference
of
situation
and
habit!
I
wish
you
would
try
to
understand
what
an
amiable
young
man
may
be
likely
to
feel
in
directly
opposing
those,
whom
as
child
and
boy
he
has
been
looking
up
to
all
his
life."
"Our
amiable
young
man
is
a
very
weak
young
man,
if
this
be
the
first
occasion
of
his
carrying
through
a
resolution
to
do
right
against
the
will
of
others.
It
ought
to
have
been
a
habit
with
him
by
this
time,
of
following
his
duty,
instead
of
consulting
expediency.
I
can
allow
for
the
fears
of
the
child,
but
not
of
the
man.
As
he
became
rational,
he
ought
to
have
roused
himself
and
shaken
off
all
that
was
unworthy
in
their
authority.
He
ought
to
have
opposed
the
first
attempt
on
their
side
to
make
him
slight
his
father.
Had
he
begun
as
he
ought,
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
now."
"We
shall
never
agree
about
him,"
cried
Emma;
"but
that
is
nothing
extraordinary.
I
have
not
the
least
idea
of
his
being
a
weak
young
man:
I
feel
sure
that
he
is
not.
Mr.
Weston
would
not
be
blind
to
folly,
though
in
his
own
son;
but
he
is
very
likely
to
have
a
more
yielding,
complying,
mild
disposition
than
would
suit
your
notions
of
man's
perfection.
I
dare
say
he
has;
and
though
it
may
cut
him
off
from
some
advantages,
it
will
secure
him
many
others."
"Yes;
all
the
advantages
of
sitting
still
when
he
ought
to
move,
and
of
leading
a
life
of
mere
idle
pleasure,
and
fancying
himself
extremely
expert
in
