any
other
man."
"You
are
very
cruel,"
said
her
sister,
"you
will
not
let
me
smile,
and
are
provoking
me
to
it
every
moment."
"How
hard
it
is
in
some
cases
to
be
believed!"
"And
how
impossible
in
others!"
"But
why
should
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
I
feel
more
than
I
acknowledge?"
"That
is
a
question
which
I
hardly
know
how
to
answer.
We
all
love
to
instruct,
though
we
can
teach
only
what
is
not
worth
knowing.
Forgive
me;
and
if
you
persist
in
indifference,
do
not
make
me
your
confidante."
A
few
days
after
this
visit,
Mr.
Bingley
called
again,
and
alone.
His
friend
had
left
him
that
morning
for
London,
but
was
to
return
home
in
ten
days
time.
He
sat
with
them
above
an
hour,
and
was
in
remarkably
good
spirits.
Mrs.
Bennet
invited
him
to
dine
with
them;
but,
with
many
expressions
of
concern,
he
confessed
himself
engaged
elsewhere.
"Next
time
you
call,"
said
she,
"I
hope
we
shall
be
more
lucky."
He
should
be
particularly
happy
at
any
time,
etc.
etc.;
and
if
she
would
give
him
leave,
would
take
an
early
opportunity
of
waiting
on
them.
"Can
you
come
to
morrow?"
Yes,
he
had
no
engagement
at
all
for
to
morrow;
and
her
invitation
was
accepted
with
alacrity.
He
came,
and
in
such
very
good
time
that
the
ladies
were
none
of
them
dressed.
In
ran
Mrs.
Bennet
to
her
daughter's
room,
in
her
dressing
gown,
and
with
her
hair
half
finished,
crying
out:
"My
dear
Jane,
make
haste
and
hurry
down.
He
is
come
Mr.
Bingley
is
come.
He
is,
indeed.
Make
haste,
make
haste.
Here,
Sarah,
come
to
Miss
Bennet
this
moment,
and
help
her
on
with
her
gown.
Never
mind
Miss
Lizzy's
hair."
"We
will
be
down
as
soon
as
we
can,"
said
Jane;
"but
I
dare
say
Kitty
is
forwarder
than
either
of
us,
for
she
went
up
stairs
half
an
hour
ago."
"Oh!
hang
Kitty!
what
has
she
to
do
with
it?
Come
be
quick,
be
quick!
Where
is
your
sash,
my
dear?"
But
when
her
mother
was
gone,
Jane
would
not
be
prevailed
on
to
go
down
without
one
of
her
sisters.
The
same
anxiety
to
get
them
by
themselves
was
visible
again
in
the
evening.
After
tea,
Mr.
Bennet
retired
to
the
library,
as
was
his
custom,
and
Mary
went
up
stairs
to
her
instrument.
Two
obstacles
of
the
five
being
thus
removed,
Mrs.
Bennet
sat
looking
and
winking
at
Elizabeth
and
Catherine
for
a
considerable
time,
without
making
any
impression
on
them.
Elizabeth
would
not
observe
her;
and
when
at
last
Kitty
did,
she
very
innocently
said,
"What
is
the
matter
mamma?
What
do
you
keep
winking
at
me
for?
What
am
I
to
do?"
"Nothing
child,
nothing.
I
did
not
wink
at
you."
She
then
sat
still
five
minutes
longer;
but
unable
to
waste
such
a
precious
occasion,
she
suddenly
got
up,
and
saying
to
Kitty,
"Come
here,
my
love,
I
want
