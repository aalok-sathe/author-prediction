him."
"And
if
I
did,
(which,
however,
I
am
far
from
allowing)
I
should
not
feel
that
I
had
done
wrong.
Mr.
Martin
is
a
very
respectable
young
man,
but
I
cannot
admit
him
to
be
Harriet's
equal;
and
am
rather
surprized
indeed
that
he
should
have
ventured
to
address
her.
By
your
account,
he
does
seem
to
have
had
some
scruples.
It
is
a
pity
that
they
were
ever
got
over."
"Not
Harriet's
equal!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Knightley
loudly
and
warmly;
and
with
calmer
asperity,
added,
a
few
moments
afterwards,
"No,
he
is
not
her
equal
indeed,
for
he
is
as
much
her
superior
in
sense
as
in
situation.
Emma,
your
infatuation
about
that
girl
blinds
you.
What
are
Harriet
Smith's
claims,
either
of
birth,
nature
or
education,
to
any
connexion
higher
than
Robert
Martin?
She
is
the
natural
daughter
of
nobody
knows
whom,
with
probably
no
settled
provision
at
all,
and
certainly
no
respectable
relations.
She
is
known
only
as
parlour
boarder
at
a
common
school.
She
is
not
a
sensible
girl,
nor
a
girl
of
any
information.
She
has
been
taught
nothing
useful,
and
is
too
young
and
too
simple
to
have
acquired
any
thing
herself.
At
her
age
she
can
have
no
experience,
and
with
her
little
wit,
is
not
very
likely
ever
to
have
any
that
can
avail
her.
She
is
pretty,
and
she
is
good
tempered,
and
that
is
all.
My
only
scruple
in
advising
the
match
was
on
his
account,
as
being
beneath
his
deserts,
and
a
bad
connexion
for
him.
I
felt
that,
as
to
fortune,
in
all
probability
he
might
do
much
better;
and
that
as
to
a
rational
companion
or
useful
helpmate,
he
could
not
do
worse.
But
I
could
not
reason
so
to
a
man
in
love,
and
was
willing
to
trust
to
there
being
no
harm
in
her,
to
her
having
that
sort
of
disposition,
which,
in
good
hands,
like
his,
might
be
easily
led
aright
and
turn
out
very
well.
The
advantage
of
the
match
I
felt
to
be
all
on
her
side;
and
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
(nor
have
I
now)
that
there
would
be
a
general
cry
out
upon
her
extreme
good
luck.
Even
your
satisfaction
I
made
sure
of.
It
crossed
my
mind
immediately
that
you
would
not
regret
your
friend's
leaving
Highbury,
for
the
sake
of
her
being
settled
so
well.
I
remember
saying
to
myself,
'Even
Emma,
with
all
her
partiality
for
Harriet,
will
think
this
a
good
match.'"
"I
cannot
help
wondering
at
your
knowing
so
little
of
Emma
as
to
say
any
such
thing.
What!
think
a
farmer,
(and
with
all
his
sense
and
all
his
merit
Mr.
Martin
is
nothing
more,)
a
good
match
for
my
intimate
friend!
Not
regret
her
leaving
Highbury
for
the
sake
of
marrying
a
man
whom
I
could
never
admit
as
an
acquaintance
of
my
own!
I
wonder
you
should
think
it
possible
for
me
to
have
such
feelings.
I
assure
you
mine
are
