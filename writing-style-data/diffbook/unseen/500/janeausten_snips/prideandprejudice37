am
sure!
Well,
I
am
sure
I
shall
be
extremely
glad
to
see
Mr.
Bingley.
But
good
Lord!
how
unlucky!
There
is
not
a
bit
of
fish
to
be
got
to
day.
Lydia,
my
love,
ring
the
bell
I
must
speak
to
Hill
this
moment."
"It
is
not
Mr.
Bingley,"
said
her
husband;
"it
is
a
person
whom
I
never
saw
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life."
This
roused
a
general
astonishment;
and
he
had
the
pleasure
of
being
eagerly
questioned
by
his
wife
and
his
five
daughters
at
once.
After
amusing
himself
some
time
with
their
curiosity,
he
thus
explained:
"About
a
month
ago
I
received
this
letter;
and
about
a
fortnight
ago
I
answered
it,
for
I
thought
it
a
case
of
some
delicacy,
and
requiring
early
attention.
It
is
from
my
cousin,
Mr.
Collins,
who,
when
I
am
dead,
may
turn
you
all
out
of
this
house
as
soon
as
he
pleases."
"Oh!
my
dear,"
cried
his
wife,
"I
cannot
bear
to
hear
that
mentioned.
Pray
do
not
talk
of
that
odious
man.
I
do
think
it
is
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world,
that
your
estate
should
be
entailed
away
from
your
own
children;
and
I
am
sure,
if
I
had
been
you,
I
should
have
tried
long
ago
to
do
something
or
other
about
it."
Jane
and
Elizabeth
tried
to
explain
to
her
the
nature
of
an
entail.
They
had
often
attempted
to
do
it
before,
but
it
was
a
subject
on
which
Mrs.
Bennet
was
beyond
the
reach
of
reason,
and
she
continued
to
rail
bitterly
against
the
cruelty
of
settling
an
estate
away
from
a
family
of
five
daughters,
in
favour
of
a
man
whom
nobody
cared
anything
about.
"It
certainly
is
a
most
iniquitous
affair,"
said
Mr.
Bennet,
"and
nothing
can
clear
Mr.
Collins
from
the
guilt
of
inheriting
Longbourn.
But
if
you
will
listen
to
his
letter,
you
may
perhaps
be
a
little
softened
by
his
manner
of
expressing
himself."
"No,
that
I
am
sure
I
shall
not;
and
I
think
it
is
very
impertinent
of
him
to
write
to
you
at
all,
and
very
hypocritical.
I
hate
such
false
friends.
Why
could
he
not
keep
on
quarreling
with
you,
as
his
father
did
before
him?"
"Why,
indeed;
he
does
seem
to
have
had
some
filial
scruples
on
that
head,
as
you
will
hear."
"Hunsford,
near
Westerham,
Kent,
15th
October.
"Dear
Sir,
"The
disagreement
subsisting
between
yourself
and
my
late
honoured
father
always
gave
me
much
uneasiness,
and
since
I
have
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
him,
I
have
frequently
wished
to
heal
the
breach;
but
for
some
time
I
was
kept
back
by
my
own
doubts,
fearing
lest
it
might
seem
disrespectful
to
his
memory
for
me
to
be
on
good
terms
with
anyone
with
whom
it
had
always
pleased
him
to
be
at
variance.
'There,
Mrs.
Bennet.'
My
mind,
however,
is
now
made
up
on
the
subject,
for
having
received
ordination
at
Easter,
I
have
been
so
fortunate
