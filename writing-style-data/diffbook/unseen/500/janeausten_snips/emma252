to
be
now
actually
determined
on,
might
be
as
much
for
Miss
Fairfax's
advantage
and
comfort
as
possible.
"It
must
be
a
severe
trial
to
them
all.
She
had
understood
it
was
to
be
delayed
till
Colonel
Campbell's
return."
"So
very
kind!"
replied
Miss
Bates.
"But
you
are
always
kind."
There
was
no
bearing
such
an
"always;"
and
to
break
through
her
dreadful
gratitude,
Emma
made
the
direct
inquiry
of
"Where
may
I
ask?
is
Miss
Fairfax
going?"
"To
a
Mrs.
Smallridge
charming
woman
most
superior
to
have
the
charge
of
her
three
little
girls
delightful
children.
Impossible
that
any
situation
could
be
more
replete
with
comfort;
if
we
except,
perhaps,
Mrs.
Suckling's
own
family,
and
Mrs.
Bragge's;
but
Mrs.
Smallridge
is
intimate
with
both,
and
in
the
very
same
neighbourhood:
lives
only
four
miles
from
Maple
Grove.
Jane
will
be
only
four
miles
from
Maple
Grove."
"Mrs.
Elton,
I
suppose,
has
been
the
person
to
whom
Miss
Fairfax
owes
"
"Yes,
our
good
Mrs.
Elton.
The
most
indefatigable,
true
friend.
She
would
not
take
a
denial.
She
would
not
let
Jane
say,
'No;'
for
when
Jane
first
heard
of
it,
(it
was
the
day
before
yesterday,
the
very
morning
we
were
at
Donwell,)
when
Jane
first
heard
of
it,
she
was
quite
decided
against
accepting
the
offer,
and
for
the
reasons
you
mention;
exactly
as
you
say,
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
close
with
nothing
till
Colonel
Campbell's
return,
and
nothing
should
induce
her
to
enter
into
any
engagement
at
present
and
so
she
told
Mrs.
Elton
over
and
over
again
and
I
am
sure
I
had
no
more
idea
that
she
would
change
her
mind!
but
that
good
Mrs.
Elton,
whose
judgment
never
fails
her,
saw
farther
than
I
did.
It
is
not
every
body
that
would
have
stood
out
in
such
a
kind
way
as
she
did,
and
refuse
to
take
Jane's
answer;
but
she
positively
declared
she
would
not
write
any
such
denial
yesterday,
as
Jane
wished
her;
she
would
wait
and,
sure
enough,
yesterday
evening
it
was
all
settled
that
Jane
should
go.
Quite
a
surprize
to
me!
I
had
not
the
least
idea!
Jane
took
Mrs.
Elton
aside,
and
told
her
at
once,
that
upon
thinking
over
the
advantages
of
Mrs.
Smallridge's
situation,
she
had
come
to
the
resolution
of
accepting
it.
I
did
not
know
a
word
of
it
till
it
was
all
settled."
"You
spent
the
evening
with
Mrs.
Elton?"
"Yes,
all
of
us;
Mrs.
Elton
would
have
us
come.
It
was
settled
so,
upon
the
hill,
while
we
were
walking
about
with
Mr.
Knightley.
'You
must
all
spend
your
evening
with
us,'
said
she
'I
positively
must
have
you
all
come.'"
"Mr.
Knightley
was
there
too,
was
he?"
"No,
not
Mr.
Knightley;
he
declined
it
from
the
first;
and
though
I
thought
he
would
come,
because
Mrs.
Elton
declared
she
would
not
let
him
off,
he
did
not;
but
my
mother,
and
Jane,
and
I,
were
all
there,
and
