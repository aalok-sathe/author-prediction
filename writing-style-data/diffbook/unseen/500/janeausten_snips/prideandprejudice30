the
circumstance
occurs
before
we
discuss
the
discretion
of
his
behaviour
thereupon.
But
in
general
and
ordinary
cases
between
friend
and
friend,
where
one
of
them
is
desired
by
the
other
to
change
a
resolution
of
no
very
great
moment,
should
you
think
ill
of
that
person
for
complying
with
the
desire,
without
waiting
to
be
argued
into
it?"
"Will
it
not
be
advisable,
before
we
proceed
on
this
subject,
to
arrange
with
rather
more
precision
the
degree
of
importance
which
is
to
appertain
to
this
request,
as
well
as
the
degree
of
intimacy
subsisting
between
the
parties?"
"By
all
means,"
cried
Bingley;
"let
us
hear
all
the
particulars,
not
forgetting
their
comparative
height
and
size;
for
that
will
have
more
weight
in
the
argument,
Miss
Bennet,
than
you
may
be
aware
of.
I
assure
you,
that
if
Darcy
were
not
such
a
great
tall
fellow,
in
comparison
with
myself,
I
should
not
pay
him
half
so
much
deference.
I
declare
I
do
not
know
a
more
awful
object
than
Darcy,
on
particular
occasions,
and
in
particular
places;
at
his
own
house
especially,
and
of
a
Sunday
evening,
when
he
has
nothing
to
do."
Mr.
Darcy
smiled;
but
Elizabeth
thought
she
could
perceive
that
he
was
rather
offended,
and
therefore
checked
her
laugh.
Miss
Bingley
warmly
resented
the
indignity
he
had
received,
in
an
expostulation
with
her
brother
for
talking
such
nonsense.
"I
see
your
design,
Bingley,"
said
his
friend.
"You
dislike
an
argument,
and
want
to
silence
this."
"Perhaps
I
do.
Arguments
are
too
much
like
disputes.
If
you
and
Miss
Bennet
will
defer
yours
till
I
am
out
of
the
room,
I
shall
be
very
thankful;
and
then
you
may
say
whatever
you
like
of
me."
"What
you
ask,"
said
Elizabeth,
"is
no
sacrifice
on
my
side;
and
Mr.
Darcy
had
much
better
finish
his
letter."
Mr.
Darcy
took
her
advice,
and
did
finish
his
letter.
When
that
business
was
over,
he
applied
to
Miss
Bingley
and
Elizabeth
for
an
indulgence
of
some
music.
Miss
Bingley
moved
with
some
alacrity
to
the
pianoforte;
and,
after
a
polite
request
that
Elizabeth
would
lead
the
way
which
the
other
as
politely
and
more
earnestly
negatived,
she
seated
herself.
Mrs.
Hurst
sang
with
her
sister,
and
while
they
were
thus
employed,
Elizabeth
could
not
help
observing,
as
she
turned
over
some
music
books
that
lay
on
the
instrument,
how
frequently
Mr.
Darcy's
eyes
were
fixed
on
her.
She
hardly
knew
how
to
suppose
that
she
could
be
an
object
of
admiration
to
so
great
a
man;
and
yet
that
he
should
look
at
her
because
he
disliked
her,
was
still
more
strange.
She
could
only
imagine,
however,
at
last
that
she
drew
his
notice
because
there
was
something
more
wrong
and
reprehensible,
according
to
his
ideas
of
right,
than
in
any
other
person
present.
The
supposition
did
not
pain
her.
She
liked
him
too
little
to
care
for
his
approbation.
After
playing
some
Italian
songs,
Miss
Bingley
varied
the
charm
by
