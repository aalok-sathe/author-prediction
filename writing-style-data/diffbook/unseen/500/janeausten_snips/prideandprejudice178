been
wearied
by
long
expectations.
The
little
Gardiners,
attracted
by
the
sight
of
a
chaise,
were
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
house
as
they
entered
the
paddock;
and,
when
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door,
the
joyful
surprise
that
lighted
up
their
faces,
and
displayed
itself
over
their
whole
bodies,
in
a
variety
of
capers
and
frisks,
was
the
first
pleasing
earnest
of
their
welcome.
Elizabeth
jumped
out;
and,
after
giving
each
of
them
a
hasty
kiss,
hurried
into
the
vestibule,
where
Jane,
who
came
running
down
from
her
mother's
apartment,
immediately
met
her.
Elizabeth,
as
she
affectionately
embraced
her,
whilst
tears
filled
the
eyes
of
both,
lost
not
a
moment
in
asking
whether
anything
had
been
heard
of
the
fugitives.
"Not
yet,"
replied
Jane.
"But
now
that
my
dear
uncle
is
come,
I
hope
everything
will
be
well."
"Is
my
father
in
town?"
"Yes,
he
went
on
Tuesday,
as
I
wrote
you
word."
"And
have
you
heard
from
him
often?"
"We
have
heard
only
twice.
He
wrote
me
a
few
lines
on
Wednesday
to
say
that
he
had
arrived
in
safety,
and
to
give
me
his
directions,
which
I
particularly
begged
him
to
do.
He
merely
added
that
he
should
not
write
again
till
he
had
something
of
importance
to
mention."
"And
my
mother
how
is
she?
How
are
you
all?"
"My
mother
is
tolerably
well,
I
trust;
though
her
spirits
are
greatly
shaken.
She
is
up
stairs
and
will
have
great
satisfaction
in
seeing
you
all.
She
does
not
yet
leave
her
dressing
room.
Mary
and
Kitty,
thank
Heaven,
are
quite
well."
"But
you
how
are
you?"
cried
Elizabeth.
"You
look
pale.
How
much
you
must
have
gone
through!"
Her
sister,
however,
assured
her
of
her
being
perfectly
well;
and
their
conversation,
which
had
been
passing
while
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
were
engaged
with
their
children,
was
now
put
an
end
to
by
the
approach
of
the
whole
party.
Jane
ran
to
her
uncle
and
aunt,
and
welcomed
and
thanked
them
both,
with
alternate
smiles
and
tears.
When
they
were
all
in
the
drawing
room,
the
questions
which
Elizabeth
had
already
asked
were
of
course
repeated
by
the
others,
and
they
soon
found
that
Jane
had
no
intelligence
to
give.
The
sanguine
hope
of
good,
however,
which
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
suggested
had
not
yet
deserted
her;
she
still
expected
that
it
would
all
end
well,
and
that
every
morning
would
bring
some
letter,
either
from
Lydia
or
her
father,
to
explain
their
proceedings,
and,
perhaps,
announce
their
marriage.
Mrs.
Bennet,
to
whose
apartment
they
all
repaired,
after
a
few
minutes'
conversation
together,
received
them
exactly
as
might
be
expected;
with
tears
and
lamentations
of
regret,
invectives
against
the
villainous
conduct
of
Wickham,
and
complaints
of
her
own
sufferings
and
ill
usage;
blaming
everybody
but
the
person
to
whose
ill
judging
indulgence
the
errors
of
her
daughter
must
principally
be
owing.
"If
I
had
been
able,"
said
she,
"to
carry
my
point
in
going
to
