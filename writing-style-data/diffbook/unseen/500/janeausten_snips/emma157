sort
excessively.'
I
never
shall
forget
his
manner.
And
when
I
brought
out
the
baked
apples
from
the
closet,
and
hoped
our
friends
would
be
so
very
obliging
as
to
take
some,
'Oh!'
said
he
directly,
'there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
fruit
half
so
good,
and
these
are
the
finest
looking
home
baked
apples
I
ever
saw
in
my
life.'
That,
you
know,
was
so
very....
And
I
am
sure,
by
his
manner,
it
was
no
compliment.
Indeed
they
are
very
delightful
apples,
and
Mrs.
Wallis
does
them
full
justice
only
we
do
not
have
them
baked
more
than
twice,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
made
us
promise
to
have
them
done
three
times
but
Miss
Woodhouse
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
mention
it.
The
apples
themselves
are
the
very
finest
sort
for
baking,
beyond
a
doubt;
all
from
Donwell
some
of
Mr.
Knightley's
most
liberal
supply.
He
sends
us
a
sack
every
year;
and
certainly
there
never
was
such
a
keeping
apple
anywhere
as
one
of
his
trees
I
believe
there
is
two
of
them.
My
mother
says
the
orchard
was
always
famous
in
her
younger
days.
But
I
was
really
quite
shocked
the
other
day
for
Mr.
Knightley
called
one
morning,
and
Jane
was
eating
these
apples,
and
we
talked
about
them
and
said
how
much
she
enjoyed
them,
and
he
asked
whether
we
were
not
got
to
the
end
of
our
stock.
'I
am
sure
you
must
be,'
said
he,
'and
I
will
send
you
another
supply;
for
I
have
a
great
many
more
than
I
can
ever
use.
William
Larkins
let
me
keep
a
larger
quantity
than
usual
this
year.
I
will
send
you
some
more,
before
they
get
good
for
nothing.'
So
I
begged
he
would
not
for
really
as
to
ours
being
gone,
I
could
not
absolutely
say
that
we
had
a
great
many
left
it
was
but
half
a
dozen
indeed;
but
they
should
be
all
kept
for
Jane;
and
I
could
not
at
all
bear
that
he
should
be
sending
us
more,
so
liberal
as
he
had
been
already;
and
Jane
said
the
same.
And
when
he
was
gone,
she
almost
quarrelled
with
me
No,
I
should
not
say
quarrelled,
for
we
never
had
a
quarrel
in
our
lives;
but
she
was
quite
distressed
that
I
had
owned
the
apples
were
so
nearly
gone;
she
wished
I
had
made
him
believe
we
had
a
great
many
left.
Oh,
said
I,
my
dear,
I
did
say
as
much
as
I
could.
However,
the
very
same
evening
William
Larkins
came
over
with
a
large
basket
of
apples,
the
same
sort
of
apples,
a
bushel
at
least,
and
I
was
very
much
obliged,
and
went
down
and
spoke
to
William
Larkins
and
said
every
thing,
as
you
may
suppose.
William
Larkins
is
such
an
old
acquaintance!
I
am
always
glad
to
see
him.
But,
however,
I
found
afterwards
from
Patty,
that
William
said
it
was
all
the
apples
of
that
sort
his
master
