not
bear
the
idea
of
her
stirring
out
of
her
house
in
the
fogs
of
December.
But
no
sooner
was
the
distress
known
to
Mr.
Elton,
than
it
was
removed.
His
gallantry
was
always
on
the
alert.
"Might
he
be
trusted
with
the
commission,
what
infinite
pleasure
should
he
have
in
executing
it!
he
could
ride
to
London
at
any
time.
It
was
impossible
to
say
how
much
he
should
be
gratified
by
being
employed
on
such
an
errand."
"He
was
too
good!
she
could
not
endure
the
thought!
she
would
not
give
him
such
a
troublesome
office
for
the
world,"
brought
on
the
desired
repetition
of
entreaties
and
assurances,
and
a
very
few
minutes
settled
the
business.
Mr.
Elton
was
to
take
the
drawing
to
London,
chuse
the
frame,
and
give
the
directions;
and
Emma
thought
she
could
so
pack
it
as
to
ensure
its
safety
without
much
incommoding
him,
while
he
seemed
mostly
fearful
of
not
being
incommoded
enough.
"What
a
precious
deposit!"
said
he
with
a
tender
sigh,
as
he
received
it.
"This
man
is
almost
too
gallant
to
be
in
love,"
thought
Emma.
"I
should
say
so,
but
that
I
suppose
there
may
be
a
hundred
different
ways
of
being
in
love.
He
is
an
excellent
young
man,
and
will
suit
Harriet
exactly;
it
will
be
an
'Exactly
so,'
as
he
says
himself;
but
he
does
sigh
and
languish,
and
study
for
compliments
rather
more
than
I
could
endure
as
a
principal.
I
come
in
for
a
pretty
good
share
as
a
second.
But
it
is
his
gratitude
on
Harriet's
account."
The
very
day
of
Mr.
Elton's
going
to
London
produced
a
fresh
occasion
for
Emma's
services
towards
her
friend.
Harriet
had
been
at
Hartfield,
as
usual,
soon
after
breakfast;
and,
after
a
time,
had
gone
home
to
return
again
to
dinner:
she
returned,
and
sooner
than
had
been
talked
of,
and
with
an
agitated,
hurried
look,
announcing
something
extraordinary
to
have
happened
which
she
was
longing
to
tell.
Half
a
minute
brought
it
all
out.
She
had
heard,
as
soon
as
she
got
back
to
Mrs.
Goddard's,
that
Mr.
Martin
had
been
there
an
hour
before,
and
finding
she
was
not
at
home,
nor
particularly
expected,
had
left
a
little
parcel
for
her
from
one
of
his
sisters,
and
gone
away;
and
on
opening
this
parcel,
she
had
actually
found,
besides
the
two
songs
which
she
had
lent
Elizabeth
to
copy,
a
letter
to
herself;
and
this
letter
was
from
him,
from
Mr.
Martin,
and
contained
a
direct
proposal
of
marriage.
"Who
could
have
thought
it?
She
was
so
surprized
she
did
not
know
what
to
do.
Yes,
quite
a
proposal
of
marriage;
and
a
very
good
letter,
at
least
she
thought
so.
And
he
wrote
as
if
he
really
loved
her
very
much
but
she
did
not
know
and
so,
she
was
come
as
fast
as
she
could
to
ask
Miss
Woodhouse
what
she
should
do.
"
Emma
was
half
ashamed
of
her
friend
