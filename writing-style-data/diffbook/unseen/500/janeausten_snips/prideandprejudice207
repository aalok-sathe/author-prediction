know.
Do
not
let
us
quarrel
about
the
past.
In
future,
I
hope
we
shall
be
always
of
one
mind."
She
held
out
her
hand;
he
kissed
it
with
affectionate
gallantry,
though
he
hardly
knew
how
to
look,
and
they
entered
the
house.
Mr.
Wickham
was
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
conversation
that
he
never
again
distressed
himself,
or
provoked
his
dear
sister
Elizabeth,
by
introducing
the
subject
of
it;
and
she
was
pleased
to
find
that
she
had
said
enough
to
keep
him
quiet.
The
day
of
his
and
Lydia's
departure
soon
came,
and
Mrs.
Bennet
was
forced
to
submit
to
a
separation,
which,
as
her
husband
by
no
means
entered
into
her
scheme
of
their
all
going
to
Newcastle,
was
likely
to
continue
at
least
a
twelvemonth.
"Oh!
my
dear
Lydia,"
she
cried,
"when
shall
we
meet
again?"
"Oh,
lord!
I
don't
know.
Not
these
two
or
three
years,
perhaps."
"Write
to
me
very
often,
my
dear."
"As
often
as
I
can.
But
you
know
married
women
have
never
much
time
for
writing.
My
sisters
may
write
to
me.
They
will
have
nothing
else
to
do."
Mr.
Wickham's
adieus
were
much
more
affectionate
than
his
wife's.
He
smiled,
looked
handsome,
and
said
many
pretty
things.
"He
is
as
fine
a
fellow,"
said
Mr.
Bennet,
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
house,
"as
ever
I
saw.
He
simpers,
and
smirks,
and
makes
love
to
us
all.
I
am
prodigiously
proud
of
him.
I
defy
even
Sir
William
Lucas
himself
to
produce
a
more
valuable
son
in
law."
The
loss
of
her
daughter
made
Mrs.
Bennet
very
dull
for
several
days.
"I
often
think,"
said
she,
"that
there
is
nothing
so
bad
as
parting
with
one's
friends.
One
seems
so
forlorn
without
them."
"This
is
the
consequence,
you
see,
Madam,
of
marrying
a
daughter,"
said
Elizabeth.
"It
must
make
you
better
satisfied
that
your
other
four
are
single."
"It
is
no
such
thing.
Lydia
does
not
leave
me
because
she
is
married,
but
only
because
her
husband's
regiment
happens
to
be
so
far
off.
If
that
had
been
nearer,
she
would
not
have
gone
so
soon."
But
the
spiritless
condition
which
this
event
threw
her
into
was
shortly
relieved,
and
her
mind
opened
again
to
the
agitation
of
hope,
by
an
article
of
news
which
then
began
to
be
in
circulation.
The
housekeeper
at
Netherfield
had
received
orders
to
prepare
for
the
arrival
of
her
master,
who
was
coming
down
in
a
day
or
two,
to
shoot
there
for
several
weeks.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
quite
in
the
fidgets.
She
looked
at
Jane,
and
smiled
and
shook
her
head
by
turns.
"Well,
well,
and
so
Mr.
Bingley
is
coming
down,
sister,"
(for
Mrs.
Phillips
first
brought
her
the
news).
"Well,
so
much
the
better.
Not
that
I
care
about
it,
though.
He
is
nothing
to
us,
you
know,
and
I
am
sure
I
never
want
to
see
him
again.
But,
however,
he
is
very
welcome
to
come
to
Netherfield,
