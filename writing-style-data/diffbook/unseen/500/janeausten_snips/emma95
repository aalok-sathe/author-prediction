as
warmly
into
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston's
disappointment,
as
might
naturally
belong
to
their
friendship.
She
was
the
first
to
announce
it
to
Mr.
Knightley;
and
exclaimed
quite
as
much
as
was
necessary,
(or,
being
acting
a
part,
perhaps
rather
more,)
at
the
conduct
of
the
Churchills,
in
keeping
him
away.
She
then
proceeded
to
say
a
good
deal
more
than
she
felt,
of
the
advantage
of
such
an
addition
to
their
confined
society
in
Surry;
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
somebody
new;
the
gala
day
to
Highbury
entire,
which
the
sight
of
him
would
have
made;
and
ending
with
reflections
on
the
Churchills
again,
found
herself
directly
involved
in
a
disagreement
with
Mr.
Knightley;
and,
to
her
great
amusement,
perceived
that
she
was
taking
the
other
side
of
the
question
from
her
real
opinion,
and
making
use
of
Mrs.
Weston's
arguments
against
herself.
"The
Churchills
are
very
likely
in
fault,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
coolly;
"but
I
dare
say
he
might
come
if
he
would."
"I
do
not
know
why
you
should
say
so.
He
wishes
exceedingly
to
come;
but
his
uncle
and
aunt
will
not
spare
him."
"I
cannot
believe
that
he
has
not
the
power
of
coming,
if
he
made
a
point
of
it.
It
is
too
unlikely,
for
me
to
believe
it
without
proof."
"How
odd
you
are!
What
has
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
done,
to
make
you
suppose
him
such
an
unnatural
creature?"
"I
am
not
supposing
him
at
all
an
unnatural
creature,
in
suspecting
that
he
may
have
learnt
to
be
above
his
connexions,
and
to
care
very
little
for
any
thing
but
his
own
pleasure,
from
living
with
those
who
have
always
set
him
the
example
of
it.
It
is
a
great
deal
more
natural
than
one
could
wish,
that
a
young
man,
brought
up
by
those
who
are
proud,
luxurious,
and
selfish,
should
be
proud,
luxurious,
and
selfish
too.
If
Frank
Churchill
had
wanted
to
see
his
father,
he
would
have
contrived
it
between
September
and
January.
A
man
at
his
age
what
is
he?
three
or
four
and
twenty
cannot
be
without
the
means
of
doing
as
much
as
that.
It
is
impossible."
"That's
easily
said,
and
easily
felt
by
you,
who
have
always
been
your
own
master.
You
are
the
worst
judge
in
the
world,
Mr.
Knightley,
of
the
difficulties
of
dependence.
You
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
tempers
to
manage."
"It
is
not
to
be
conceived
that
a
man
of
three
or
four
and
twenty
should
not
have
liberty
of
mind
or
limb
to
that
amount.
He
cannot
want
money
he
cannot
want
leisure.
We
know,
on
the
contrary,
that
he
has
so
much
of
both,
that
he
is
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
at
the
idlest
haunts
in
the
kingdom.
We
hear
of
him
for
ever
at
some
watering
place
or
other.
A
little
while
ago,
he
was
at
Weymouth.
This
proves
that
he
can
leave
the
Churchills."
"Yes,
sometimes
he
can."
"And
those
times
are
