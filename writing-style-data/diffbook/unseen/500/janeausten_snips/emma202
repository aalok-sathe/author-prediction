it
in
a
letter
to
day.
I
met
the
letters
in
my
way
this
morning,
and
seeing
my
son's
hand,
presumed
to
open
it
though
it
was
not
directed
to
me
it
was
to
Mrs.
Weston.
She
is
his
principal
correspondent,
I
assure
you.
I
hardly
ever
get
a
letter."
"And
so
you
absolutely
opened
what
was
directed
to
her!
Oh!
Mr.
Weston
(laughing
affectedly)
I
must
protest
against
that.
A
most
dangerous
precedent
indeed!
I
beg
you
will
not
let
your
neighbours
follow
your
example.
Upon
my
word,
if
this
is
what
I
am
to
expect,
we
married
women
must
begin
to
exert
ourselves!
Oh!
Mr.
Weston,
I
could
not
have
believed
it
of
you!"
"Aye,
we
men
are
sad
fellows.
You
must
take
care
of
yourself,
Mrs.
Elton.
This
letter
tells
us
it
is
a
short
letter
written
in
a
hurry,
merely
to
give
us
notice
it
tells
us
that
they
are
all
coming
up
to
town
directly,
on
Mrs.
Churchill's
account
she
has
not
been
well
the
whole
winter,
and
thinks
Enscombe
too
cold
for
her
so
they
are
all
to
move
southward
without
loss
of
time."
"Indeed!
from
Yorkshire,
I
think.
Enscombe
is
in
Yorkshire?"
"Yes,
they
are
about
one
hundred
and
ninety
miles
from
London,
a
considerable
journey."
"Yes,
upon
my
word,
very
considerable.
Sixty
five
miles
farther
than
from
Maple
Grove
to
London.
But
what
is
distance,
Mr.
Weston,
to
people
of
large
fortune?
You
would
be
amazed
to
hear
how
my
brother,
Mr.
Suckling,
sometimes
flies
about.
You
will
hardly
believe
me
but
twice
in
one
week
he
and
Mr.
Bragge
went
to
London
and
back
again
with
four
horses."
"The
evil
of
the
distance
from
Enscombe,"
said
Mr.
Weston,
"is,
that
Mrs.
Churchill,
as
we
understand,
has
not
been
able
to
leave
the
sofa
for
a
week
together.
In
Frank's
last
letter
she
complained,
he
said,
of
being
too
weak
to
get
into
her
conservatory
without
having
both
his
arm
and
his
uncle's!
This,
you
know,
speaks
a
great
degree
of
weakness
but
now
she
is
so
impatient
to
be
in
town,
that
she
means
to
sleep
only
two
nights
on
the
road.
So
Frank
writes
word.
Certainly,
delicate
ladies
have
very
extraordinary
constitutions,
Mrs.
Elton.
You
must
grant
me
that."
"No,
indeed,
I
shall
grant
you
nothing.
I
always
take
the
part
of
my
own
sex.
I
do
indeed.
I
give
you
notice
You
will
find
me
a
formidable
antagonist
on
that
point.
I
always
stand
up
for
women
and
I
assure
you,
if
you
knew
how
Selina
feels
with
respect
to
sleeping
at
an
inn,
you
would
not
wonder
at
Mrs.
Churchill's
making
incredible
exertions
to
avoid
it.
Selina
says
it
is
quite
horror
to
her
and
I
believe
I
have
caught
a
little
of
her
nicety.
She
always
travels
with
her
own
sheets;
an
excellent
precaution.
Does
Mrs.
Churchill
do
the
same?"
"Depend
upon
it,
Mrs.
Churchill
does
every
thing
that
any
other
fine
lady
ever
did.
Mrs.
Churchill
