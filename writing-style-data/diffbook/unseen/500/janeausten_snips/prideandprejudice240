you.
There
I
have
saved
you
the
trouble
of
accounting
for
it;
and
really,
all
things
considered,
I
begin
to
think
it
perfectly
reasonable.
To
be
sure,
you
knew
no
actual
good
of
me
but
nobody
thinks
of
that
when
they
fall
in
love."
"Was
there
no
good
in
your
affectionate
behaviour
to
Jane
while
she
was
ill
at
Netherfield?"
"Dearest
Jane!
who
could
have
done
less
for
her?
But
make
a
virtue
of
it
by
all
means.
My
good
qualities
are
under
your
protection,
and
you
are
to
exaggerate
them
as
much
as
possible;
and,
in
return,
it
belongs
to
me
to
find
occasions
for
teasing
and
quarrelling
with
you
as
often
as
may
be;
and
I
shall
begin
directly
by
asking
you
what
made
you
so
unwilling
to
come
to
the
point
at
last.
What
made
you
so
shy
of
me,
when
you
first
called,
and
afterwards
dined
here?
Why,
especially,
when
you
called,
did
you
look
as
if
you
did
not
care
about
me?"
"Because
you
were
grave
and
silent,
and
gave
me
no
encouragement."
"But
I
was
embarrassed."
"And
so
was
I."
"You
might
have
talked
to
me
more
when
you
came
to
dinner."
"A
man
who
had
felt
less,
might."
"How
unlucky
that
you
should
have
a
reasonable
answer
to
give,
and
that
I
should
be
so
reasonable
as
to
admit
it!
But
I
wonder
how
long
you
would
have
gone
on,
if
you
had
been
left
to
yourself.
I
wonder
when
you
would
have
spoken,
if
I
had
not
asked
you!
My
resolution
of
thanking
you
for
your
kindness
to
Lydia
had
certainly
great
effect.
Too
much,
I
am
afraid;
for
what
becomes
of
the
moral,
if
our
comfort
springs
from
a
breach
of
promise?
for
I
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
the
subject.
This
will
never
do."
"You
need
not
distress
yourself.
The
moral
will
be
perfectly
fair.
Lady
Catherine's
unjustifiable
endeavours
to
separate
us
were
the
means
of
removing
all
my
doubts.
I
am
not
indebted
for
my
present
happiness
to
your
eager
desire
of
expressing
your
gratitude.
I
was
not
in
a
humour
to
wait
for
any
opening
of
yours.
My
aunt's
intelligence
had
given
me
hope,
and
I
was
determined
at
once
to
know
every
thing."
"Lady
Catherine
has
been
of
infinite
use,
which
ought
to
make
her
happy,
for
she
loves
to
be
of
use.
But
tell
me,
what
did
you
come
down
to
Netherfield
for?
Was
it
merely
to
ride
to
Longbourn
and
be
embarrassed?
or
had
you
intended
any
more
serious
consequence?"
"My
real
purpose
was
to
see
you,
and
to
judge,
if
I
could,
whether
I
might
ever
hope
to
make
you
love
me.
My
avowed
one,
or
what
I
avowed
to
myself,
was
to
see
whether
your
sister
were
still
partial
to
Bingley,
and
if
she
were,
to
make
the
confession
to
him
which
I
have
since
made."
"Shall
you
ever
have
courage
to
announce
to
Lady
Catherine
what
is
to
befall
her?"
"I
