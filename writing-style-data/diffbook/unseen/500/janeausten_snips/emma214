while,
till
another
suspension
brought
Mrs.
Elton's
tones
again
distinctly
forward.
Mr.
Elton
had
just
joined
them,
and
his
wife
was
exclaiming,
"Oh!
you
have
found
us
out
at
last,
have
you,
in
our
seclusion?
I
was
this
moment
telling
Jane,
I
thought
you
would
begin
to
be
impatient
for
tidings
of
us."
"Jane!"
repeated
Frank
Churchill,
with
a
look
of
surprize
and
displeasure.
"That
is
easy
but
Miss
Fairfax
does
not
disapprove
it,
I
suppose."
"How
do
you
like
Mrs.
Elton?"
said
Emma
in
a
whisper.
"Not
at
all."
"You
are
ungrateful."
"Ungrateful!
What
do
you
mean?"
Then
changing
from
a
frown
to
a
smile
"No,
do
not
tell
me
I
do
not
want
to
know
what
you
mean.
Where
is
my
father?
When
are
we
to
begin
dancing?"
Emma
could
hardly
understand
him;
he
seemed
in
an
odd
humour.
He
walked
off
to
find
his
father,
but
was
quickly
back
again
with
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston.
He
had
met
with
them
in
a
little
perplexity,
which
must
be
laid
before
Emma.
It
had
just
occurred
to
Mrs.
Weston
that
Mrs.
Elton
must
be
asked
to
begin
the
ball;
that
she
would
expect
it;
which
interfered
with
all
their
wishes
of
giving
Emma
that
distinction.
Emma
heard
the
sad
truth
with
fortitude.
"And
what
are
we
to
do
for
a
proper
partner
for
her?"
said
Mr.
Weston.
"She
will
think
Frank
ought
to
ask
her."
Frank
turned
instantly
to
Emma,
to
claim
her
former
promise;
and
boasted
himself
an
engaged
man,
which
his
father
looked
his
most
perfect
approbation
of
and
it
then
appeared
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
wanting
him
to
dance
with
Mrs.
Elton
himself,
and
that
their
business
was
to
help
to
persuade
him
into
it,
which
was
done
pretty
soon.
Mr.
Weston
and
Mrs.
Elton
led
the
way,
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
followed.
Emma
must
submit
to
stand
second
to
Mrs.
Elton,
though
she
had
always
considered
the
ball
as
peculiarly
for
her.
It
was
almost
enough
to
make
her
think
of
marrying.
Mrs.
Elton
had
undoubtedly
the
advantage,
at
this
time,
in
vanity
completely
gratified;
for
though
she
had
intended
to
begin
with
Frank
Churchill,
she
could
not
lose
by
the
change.
Mr.
Weston
might
be
his
son's
superior.
In
spite
of
this
little
rub,
however,
Emma
was
smiling
with
enjoyment,
delighted
to
see
the
respectable
length
of
the
set
as
it
was
forming,
and
to
feel
that
she
had
so
many
hours
of
unusual
festivity
before
her.
She
was
more
disturbed
by
Mr.
Knightley's
not
dancing
than
by
any
thing
else.
There
he
was,
among
the
standers
by,
where
he
ought
not
to
be;
he
ought
to
be
dancing,
not
classing
himself
with
the
husbands,
and
fathers,
and
whist
players,
who
were
pretending
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
dance
till
their
rubbers
were
made
up,
so
young
as
he
looked!
He
could
not
have
appeared
to
greater
advantage
perhaps
anywhere,
than
where
he
had
placed
himself.
His
tall,
firm,
upright
