manner
he
spoke
of
the
man
who
had
behaved
with
such
forbearance
and
liberality
towards
him.
And
there
are
other
circumstances
which
I
am
not
at
liberty
which
it
is
not
worth
while
to
relate;
but
his
lies
about
the
whole
Pemberley
family
are
endless.
From
what
he
said
of
Miss
Darcy
I
was
thoroughly
prepared
to
see
a
proud,
reserved,
disagreeable
girl.
Yet
he
knew
to
the
contrary
himself.
He
must
know
that
she
was
as
amiable
and
unpretending
as
we
have
found
her."
"But
does
Lydia
know
nothing
of
this?
can
she
be
ignorant
of
what
you
and
Jane
seem
so
well
to
understand?"
"Oh,
yes!
that,
that
is
the
worst
of
all.
Till
I
was
in
Kent,
and
saw
so
much
both
of
Mr.
Darcy
and
his
relation
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
I
was
ignorant
of
the
truth
myself.
And
when
I
returned
home,
the
shire
was
to
leave
Meryton
in
a
week
or
fortnight's
time.
As
that
was
the
case,
neither
Jane,
to
whom
I
related
the
whole,
nor
I,
thought
it
necessary
to
make
our
knowledge
public;
for
of
what
use
could
it
apparently
be
to
any
one,
that
the
good
opinion
which
all
the
neighbourhood
had
of
him
should
then
be
overthrown?
And
even
when
it
was
settled
that
Lydia
should
go
with
Mrs.
Forster,
the
necessity
of
opening
her
eyes
to
his
character
never
occurred
to
me.
That
she
could
be
in
any
danger
from
the
deception
never
entered
my
head.
That
such
a
consequence
as
this
could
ensue,
you
may
easily
believe,
was
far
enough
from
my
thoughts."
"When
they
all
removed
to
Brighton,
therefore,
you
had
no
reason,
I
suppose,
to
believe
them
fond
of
each
other?"
"Not
the
slightest.
I
can
remember
no
symptom
of
affection
on
either
side;
and
had
anything
of
the
kind
been
perceptible,
you
must
be
aware
that
ours
is
not
a
family
on
which
it
could
be
thrown
away.
When
first
he
entered
the
corps,
she
was
ready
enough
to
admire
him;
but
so
we
all
were.
Every
girl
in
or
near
Meryton
was
out
of
her
senses
about
him
for
the
first
two
months;
but
he
never
distinguished
her
by
any
particular
attention;
and,
consequently,
after
a
moderate
period
of
extravagant
and
wild
admiration,
her
fancy
for
him
gave
way,
and
others
of
the
regiment,
who
treated
her
with
more
distinction,
again
became
her
favourites."
It
may
be
easily
believed,
that
however
little
of
novelty
could
be
added
to
their
fears,
hopes,
and
conjectures,
on
this
interesting
subject,
by
its
repeated
discussion,
no
other
could
detain
them
from
it
long,
during
the
whole
of
the
journey.
From
Elizabeth's
thoughts
it
was
never
absent.
Fixed
there
by
the
keenest
of
all
anguish,
self
reproach,
she
could
find
no
interval
of
ease
or
forgetfulness.
They
travelled
as
expeditiously
as
possible,
and,
sleeping
one
night
on
the
road,
reached
Longbourn
by
dinner
time
the
next
day.
It
was
a
comfort
to
Elizabeth
to
consider
that
Jane
could
not
have
