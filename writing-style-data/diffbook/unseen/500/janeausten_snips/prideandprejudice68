every
respect
ill
qualified
for
the
situation."
"Were
it
certain
that
Lady
Catherine
would
think
so,"
said
Mr.
Collins
very
gravely
"but
I
cannot
imagine
that
her
ladyship
would
at
all
disapprove
of
you.
And
you
may
be
certain
when
I
have
the
honour
of
seeing
her
again,
I
shall
speak
in
the
very
highest
terms
of
your
modesty,
economy,
and
other
amiable
qualification."
"Indeed,
Mr.
Collins,
all
praise
of
me
will
be
unnecessary.
You
must
give
me
leave
to
judge
for
myself,
and
pay
me
the
compliment
of
believing
what
I
say.
I
wish
you
very
happy
and
very
rich,
and
by
refusing
your
hand,
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
your
being
otherwise.
In
making
me
the
offer,
you
must
have
satisfied
the
delicacy
of
your
feelings
with
regard
to
my
family,
and
may
take
possession
of
Longbourn
estate
whenever
it
falls,
without
any
self
reproach.
This
matter
may
be
considered,
therefore,
as
finally
settled."
And
rising
as
she
thus
spoke,
she
would
have
quitted
the
room,
had
Mr.
Collins
not
thus
addressed
her:
"When
I
do
myself
the
honour
of
speaking
to
you
next
on
the
subject,
I
shall
hope
to
receive
a
more
favourable
answer
than
you
have
now
given
me;
though
I
am
far
from
accusing
you
of
cruelty
at
present,
because
I
know
it
to
be
the
established
custom
of
your
sex
to
reject
a
man
on
the
first
application,
and
perhaps
you
have
even
now
said
as
much
to
encourage
my
suit
as
would
be
consistent
with
the
true
delicacy
of
the
female
character."
"Really,
Mr.
Collins,"
cried
Elizabeth
with
some
warmth,
"you
puzzle
me
exceedingly.
If
what
I
have
hitherto
said
can
appear
to
you
in
the
form
of
encouragement,
I
know
not
how
to
express
my
refusal
in
such
a
way
as
to
convince
you
of
its
being
one."
"You
must
give
me
leave
to
flatter
myself,
my
dear
cousin,
that
your
refusal
of
my
addresses
is
merely
words
of
course.
My
reasons
for
believing
it
are
briefly
these:
It
does
not
appear
to
me
that
my
hand
is
unworthy
of
your
acceptance,
or
that
the
establishment
I
can
offer
would
be
any
other
than
highly
desirable.
My
situation
in
life,
my
connections
with
the
family
of
de
Bourgh,
and
my
relationship
to
your
own,
are
circumstances
highly
in
my
favour;
and
you
should
take
it
into
further
consideration,
that
in
spite
of
your
manifold
attractions,
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
another
offer
of
marriage
may
ever
be
made
you.
Your
portion
is
unhappily
so
small
that
it
will
in
all
likelihood
undo
the
effects
of
your
loveliness
and
amiable
qualifications.
As
I
must
therefore
conclude
that
you
are
not
serious
in
your
rejection
of
me,
I
shall
choose
to
attribute
it
to
your
wish
of
increasing
my
love
by
suspense,
according
to
the
usual
practice
of
elegant
females."
"I
do
assure
you,
sir,
that
I
have
no
pretensions
whatever
to
that
kind
of
elegance
which
consists
in
