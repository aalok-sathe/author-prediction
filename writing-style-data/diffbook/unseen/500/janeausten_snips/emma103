is
so
impatient
to
see
them
again
for
till
she
married,
last
October,
she
was
never
away
from
them
so
much
as
a
week,
which
must
make
it
very
strange
to
be
in
different
kingdoms,
I
was
going
to
say,
but
however
different
countries,
and
so
she
wrote
a
very
urgent
letter
to
her
mother
or
her
father,
I
declare
I
do
not
know
which
it
was,
but
we
shall
see
presently
in
Jane's
letter
wrote
in
Mr.
Dixon's
name
as
well
as
her
own,
to
press
their
coming
over
directly,
and
they
would
give
them
the
meeting
in
Dublin,
and
take
them
back
to
their
country
seat,
Baly
craig,
a
beautiful
place,
I
fancy.
Jane
has
heard
a
great
deal
of
its
beauty;
from
Mr.
Dixon,
I
mean
I
do
not
know
that
she
ever
heard
about
it
from
any
body
else;
but
it
was
very
natural,
you
know,
that
he
should
like
to
speak
of
his
own
place
while
he
was
paying
his
addresses
and
as
Jane
used
to
be
very
often
walking
out
with
them
for
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
were
very
particular
about
their
daughter's
not
walking
out
often
with
only
Mr.
Dixon,
for
which
I
do
not
at
all
blame
them;
of
course
she
heard
every
thing
he
might
be
telling
Miss
Campbell
about
his
own
home
in
Ireland;
and
I
think
she
wrote
us
word
that
he
had
shewn
them
some
drawings
of
the
place,
views
that
he
had
taken
himself.
He
is
a
most
amiable,
charming
young
man,
I
believe.
Jane
was
quite
longing
to
go
to
Ireland,
from
his
account
of
things."
At
this
moment,
an
ingenious
and
animating
suspicion
entering
Emma's
brain
with
regard
to
Jane
Fairfax,
this
charming
Mr.
Dixon,
and
the
not
going
to
Ireland,
she
said,
with
the
insidious
design
of
farther
discovery,
"You
must
feel
it
very
fortunate
that
Miss
Fairfax
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
you
at
such
a
time.
Considering
the
very
particular
friendship
between
her
and
Mrs.
Dixon,
you
could
hardly
have
expected
her
to
be
excused
from
accompanying
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell."
"Very
true,
very
true,
indeed.
The
very
thing
that
we
have
always
been
rather
afraid
of;
for
we
should
not
have
liked
to
have
her
at
such
a
distance
from
us,
for
months
together
not
able
to
come
if
any
thing
was
to
happen.
But
you
see,
every
thing
turns
out
for
the
best.
They
want
her
(Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon)
excessively
to
come
over
with
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell;
quite
depend
upon
it;
nothing
can
be
more
kind
or
pressing
than
their
joint
invitation,
Jane
says,
as
you
will
hear
presently;
Mr.
Dixon
does
not
seem
in
the
least
backward
in
any
attention.
He
is
a
most
charming
young
man.
Ever
since
the
service
he
rendered
Jane
at
Weymouth,
when
they
were
out
in
that
party
on
the
water,
and
she,
by
the
sudden
whirling
round
of
something
or
other
among
the
sails,
would
have
been
dashed
into
the
