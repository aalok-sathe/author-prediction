Mrs.
Hurst
thought
the
same,
and
added:
"She
has
nothing,
in
short,
to
recommend
her,
but
being
an
excellent
walker.
I
shall
never
forget
her
appearance
this
morning.
She
really
looked
almost
wild."
"She
did,
indeed,
Louisa.
I
could
hardly
keep
my
countenance.
Very
nonsensical
to
come
at
all!
Why
must
she
be
scampering
about
the
country,
because
her
sister
had
a
cold?
Her
hair,
so
untidy,
so
blowsy!"
"Yes,
and
her
petticoat;
I
hope
you
saw
her
petticoat,
six
inches
deep
in
mud,
I
am
absolutely
certain;
and
the
gown
which
had
been
let
down
to
hide
it
not
doing
its
office."
"Your
picture
may
be
very
exact,
Louisa,"
said
Bingley;
"but
this
was
all
lost
upon
me.
I
thought
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet
looked
remarkably
well
when
she
came
into
the
room
this
morning.
Her
dirty
petticoat
quite
escaped
my
notice."
"You
observed
it,
Mr.
Darcy,
I
am
sure,"
said
Miss
Bingley;
"and
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
you
would
not
wish
to
see
your
sister
make
such
an
exhibition."
"Certainly
not."
"To
walk
three
miles,
or
four
miles,
or
five
miles,
or
whatever
it
is,
above
her
ankles
in
dirt,
and
alone,
quite
alone!
What
could
she
mean
by
it?
It
seems
to
me
to
show
an
abominable
sort
of
conceited
independence,
a
most
country
town
indifference
to
decorum."
"It
shows
an
affection
for
her
sister
that
is
very
pleasing,"
said
Bingley.
"I
am
afraid,
Mr.
Darcy,"
observed
Miss
Bingley
in
a
half
whisper,
"that
this
adventure
has
rather
affected
your
admiration
of
her
fine
eyes."
"Not
at
all,"
he
replied;
"they
were
brightened
by
the
exercise."
A
short
pause
followed
this
speech,
and
Mrs.
Hurst
began
again:
"I
have
an
excessive
regard
for
Miss
Jane
Bennet,
she
is
really
a
very
sweet
girl,
and
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
she
were
well
settled.
But
with
such
a
father
and
mother,
and
such
low
connections,
I
am
afraid
there
is
no
chance
of
it."
"I
think
I
have
heard
you
say
that
their
uncle
is
an
attorney
in
Meryton."
"Yes;
and
they
have
another,
who
lives
somewhere
near
Cheapside."
"That
is
capital,"
added
her
sister,
and
they
both
laughed
heartily.
"If
they
had
uncles
enough
to
fill
all
Cheapside,"
cried
Bingley,
"it
would
not
make
them
one
jot
less
agreeable."
"But
it
must
very
materially
lessen
their
chance
of
marrying
men
of
any
consideration
in
the
world,"
replied
Darcy.
To
this
speech
Bingley
made
no
answer;
but
his
sisters
gave
it
their
hearty
assent,
and
indulged
their
mirth
for
some
time
at
the
expense
of
their
dear
friend's
vulgar
relations.
With
a
renewal
of
tenderness,
however,
they
returned
to
her
room
on
leaving
the
dining
parlour,
and
sat
with
her
till
summoned
to
coffee.
She
was
still
very
poorly,
and
Elizabeth
would
not
quit
her
at
all,
till
late
in
the
evening,
when
she
had
the
comfort
of
seeing
her
sleep,
and
when
it
seemed
to
her
rather
right
than
pleasant
that
she
should
go
downstairs
