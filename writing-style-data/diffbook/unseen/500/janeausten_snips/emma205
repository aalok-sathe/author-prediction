doubt
that
my
opinion
will
be
decidedly
in
his
favour.
I
have
heard
so
much
in
praise
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill.
At
the
same
time
it
is
fair
to
observe,
that
I
am
one
of
those
who
always
judge
for
themselves,
and
are
by
no
means
implicitly
guided
by
others.
I
give
you
notice
that
as
I
find
your
son,
so
I
shall
judge
of
him.
I
am
no
flatterer."
Mr.
Weston
was
musing.
"I
hope,"
said
he
presently,
"I
have
not
been
severe
upon
poor
Mrs.
Churchill.
If
she
is
ill
I
should
be
sorry
to
do
her
injustice;
but
there
are
some
traits
in
her
character
which
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
speak
of
her
with
the
forbearance
I
could
wish.
You
cannot
be
ignorant,
Mrs.
Elton,
of
my
connexion
with
the
family,
nor
of
the
treatment
I
have
met
with;
and,
between
ourselves,
the
whole
blame
of
it
is
to
be
laid
to
her.
She
was
the
instigator.
Frank's
mother
would
never
have
been
slighted
as
she
was
but
for
her.
Mr.
Churchill
has
pride;
but
his
pride
is
nothing
to
his
wife's:
his
is
a
quiet,
indolent,
gentlemanlike
sort
of
pride
that
would
harm
nobody,
and
only
make
himself
a
little
helpless
and
tiresome;
but
her
pride
is
arrogance
and
insolence!
And
what
inclines
one
less
to
bear,
she
has
no
fair
pretence
of
family
or
blood.
She
was
nobody
when
he
married
her,
barely
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman;
but
ever
since
her
being
turned
into
a
Churchill
she
has
out
Churchill'd
them
all
in
high
and
mighty
claims:
but
in
herself,
I
assure
you,
she
is
an
upstart."
"Only
think!
well,
that
must
be
infinitely
provoking!
I
have
quite
a
horror
of
upstarts.
Maple
Grove
has
given
me
a
thorough
disgust
to
people
of
that
sort;
for
there
is
a
family
in
that
neighbourhood
who
are
such
an
annoyance
to
my
brother
and
sister
from
the
airs
they
give
themselves!
Your
description
of
Mrs.
Churchill
made
me
think
of
them
directly.
People
of
the
name
of
Tupman,
very
lately
settled
there,
and
encumbered
with
many
low
connexions,
but
giving
themselves
immense
airs,
and
expecting
to
be
on
a
footing
with
the
old
established
families.
A
year
and
a
half
is
the
very
utmost
that
they
can
have
lived
at
West
Hall;
and
how
they
got
their
fortune
nobody
knows.
They
came
from
Birmingham,
which
is
not
a
place
to
promise
much,
you
know,
Mr.
Weston.
One
has
not
great
hopes
from
Birmingham.
I
always
say
there
is
something
direful
in
the
sound:
but
nothing
more
is
positively
known
of
the
Tupmans,
though
a
good
many
things
I
assure
you
are
suspected;
and
yet
by
their
manners
they
evidently
think
themselves
equal
even
to
my
brother,
Mr.
Suckling,
who
happens
to
be
one
of
their
nearest
neighbours.
It
is
infinitely
too
bad.
Mr.
Suckling,
who
has
been
eleven
years
a
resident
at
Maple
Grove,
and
whose
father
had
it
before
him
I
believe,
at
