youth
was
passed
together;
inmates
of
the
same
house,
sharing
the
same
amusements,
objects
of
the
same
parental
care.
My
father
began
life
in
the
profession
which
your
uncle,
Mr.
Phillips,
appears
to
do
so
much
credit
to
but
he
gave
up
everything
to
be
of
use
to
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
and
devoted
all
his
time
to
the
care
of
the
Pemberley
property.
He
was
most
highly
esteemed
by
Mr.
Darcy,
a
most
intimate,
confidential
friend.
Mr.
Darcy
often
acknowledged
himself
to
be
under
the
greatest
obligations
to
my
father's
active
superintendence,
and
when,
immediately
before
my
father's
death,
Mr.
Darcy
gave
him
a
voluntary
promise
of
providing
for
me,
I
am
convinced
that
he
felt
it
to
be
as
much
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
him,
as
of
his
affection
to
myself."
"How
strange!"
cried
Elizabeth.
"How
abominable!
I
wonder
that
the
very
pride
of
this
Mr.
Darcy
has
not
made
him
just
to
you!
If
from
no
better
motive,
that
he
should
not
have
been
too
proud
to
be
dishonest
for
dishonesty
I
must
call
it."
"It
is
wonderful,"
replied
Wickham,
"for
almost
all
his
actions
may
be
traced
to
pride;
and
pride
had
often
been
his
best
friend.
It
has
connected
him
nearer
with
virtue
than
with
any
other
feeling.
But
we
are
none
of
us
consistent,
and
in
his
behaviour
to
me
there
were
stronger
impulses
even
than
pride."
"Can
such
abominable
pride
as
his
have
ever
done
him
good?"
"Yes.
It
has
often
led
him
to
be
liberal
and
generous,
to
give
his
money
freely,
to
display
hospitality,
to
assist
his
tenants,
and
relieve
the
poor.
Family
pride,
and
filial
pride
for
he
is
very
proud
of
what
his
father
was
have
done
this.
Not
to
appear
to
disgrace
his
family,
to
degenerate
from
the
popular
qualities,
or
lose
the
influence
of
the
Pemberley
House,
is
a
powerful
motive.
He
has
also
brotherly
pride,
which,
with
some
brotherly
affection,
makes
him
a
very
kind
and
careful
guardian
of
his
sister,
and
you
will
hear
him
generally
cried
up
as
the
most
attentive
and
best
of
brothers."
"What
sort
of
girl
is
Miss
Darcy?"
He
shook
his
head.
"I
wish
I
could
call
her
amiable.
It
gives
me
pain
to
speak
ill
of
a
Darcy.
But
she
is
too
much
like
her
brother
very,
very
proud.
As
a
child,
she
was
affectionate
and
pleasing,
and
extremely
fond
of
me;
and
I
have
devoted
hours
and
hours
to
her
amusement.
But
she
is
nothing
to
me
now.
She
is
a
handsome
girl,
about
fifteen
or
sixteen,
and,
I
understand,
highly
accomplished.
Since
her
father's
death,
her
home
has
been
London,
where
a
lady
lives
with
her,
and
superintends
her
education."
After
many
pauses
and
many
trials
of
other
subjects,
Elizabeth
could
not
help
reverting
once
more
to
the
first,
and
saying:
"I
am
astonished
at
his
intimacy
with
Mr.
Bingley!
How
can
Mr.
Bingley,
who
seems
good
humour
itself,
and
is,
I
really
believe,
truly
amiable,
