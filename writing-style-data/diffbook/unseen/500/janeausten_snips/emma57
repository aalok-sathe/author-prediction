sick
of
the
very
name
of
Jane
Fairfax.
Every
letter
from
her
is
read
forty
times
over;
her
compliments
to
all
friends
go
round
and
round
again;
and
if
she
does
but
send
her
aunt
the
pattern
of
a
stomacher,
or
knit
a
pair
of
garters
for
her
grandmother,
one
hears
of
nothing
else
for
a
month.
I
wish
Jane
Fairfax
very
well;
but
she
tires
me
to
death."
They
were
now
approaching
the
cottage,
and
all
idle
topics
were
superseded.
Emma
was
very
compassionate;
and
the
distresses
of
the
poor
were
as
sure
of
relief
from
her
personal
attention
and
kindness,
her
counsel
and
her
patience,
as
from
her
purse.
She
understood
their
ways,
could
allow
for
their
ignorance
and
their
temptations,
had
no
romantic
expectations
of
extraordinary
virtue
from
those
for
whom
education
had
done
so
little;
entered
into
their
troubles
with
ready
sympathy,
and
always
gave
her
assistance
with
as
much
intelligence
as
good
will.
In
the
present
instance,
it
was
sickness
and
poverty
together
which
she
came
to
visit;
and
after
remaining
there
as
long
as
she
could
give
comfort
or
advice,
she
quitted
the
cottage
with
such
an
impression
of
the
scene
as
made
her
say
to
Harriet,
as
they
walked
away,
"These
are
the
sights,
Harriet,
to
do
one
good.
How
trifling
they
make
every
thing
else
appear!
I
feel
now
as
if
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
these
poor
creatures
all
the
rest
of
the
day;
and
yet,
who
can
say
how
soon
it
may
all
vanish
from
my
mind?"
"Very
true,"
said
Harriet.
"Poor
creatures!
one
can
think
of
nothing
else."
"And
really,
I
do
not
think
the
impression
will
soon
be
over,"
said
Emma,
as
she
crossed
the
low
hedge,
and
tottering
footstep
which
ended
the
narrow,
slippery
path
through
the
cottage
garden,
and
brought
them
into
the
lane
again.
"I
do
not
think
it
will,"
stopping
to
look
once
more
at
all
the
outward
wretchedness
of
the
place,
and
recall
the
still
greater
within.
"Oh!
dear,
no,"
said
her
companion.
They
walked
on.
The
lane
made
a
slight
bend;
and
when
that
bend
was
passed,
Mr.
Elton
was
immediately
in
sight;
and
so
near
as
to
give
Emma
time
only
to
say
farther,
"Ah!
Harriet,
here
comes
a
very
sudden
trial
of
our
stability
in
good
thoughts.
Well,
(smiling,)
I
hope
it
may
be
allowed
that
if
compassion
has
produced
exertion
and
relief
to
the
sufferers,
it
has
done
all
that
is
truly
important.
If
we
feel
for
the
wretched,
enough
to
do
all
we
can
for
them,
the
rest
is
empty
sympathy,
only
distressing
to
ourselves."
Harriet
could
just
answer,
"Oh!
dear,
yes,"
before
the
gentleman
joined
them.
The
wants
and
sufferings
of
the
poor
family,
however,
were
the
first
subject
on
meeting.
He
had
been
going
to
call
on
them.
His
visit
he
would
now
defer;
but
they
had
a
very
interesting
parley
about
what
could
be
done
and
should
be
done.
Mr.
Elton
then
turned
back
