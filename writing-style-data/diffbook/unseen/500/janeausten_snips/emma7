open
hearted
man
like
Weston,
and
a
rational,
unaffected
woman
like
Miss
Taylor,
may
be
safely
left
to
manage
their
own
concerns.
You
are
more
likely
to
have
done
harm
to
yourself,
than
good
to
them,
by
interference."
"Emma
never
thinks
of
herself,
if
she
can
do
good
to
others,"
rejoined
Mr.
Woodhouse,
understanding
but
in
part.
"But,
my
dear,
pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches;
they
are
silly
things,
and
break
up
one's
family
circle
grievously."
"Only
one
more,
papa;
only
for
Mr.
Elton.
Poor
Mr.
Elton!
You
like
Mr.
Elton,
papa,
I
must
look
about
for
a
wife
for
him.
There
is
nobody
in
Highbury
who
deserves
him
and
he
has
been
here
a
whole
year,
and
has
fitted
up
his
house
so
comfortably,
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
him
single
any
longer
and
I
thought
when
he
was
joining
their
hands
to
day,
he
looked
so
very
much
as
if
he
would
like
to
have
the
same
kind
office
done
for
him!
I
think
very
well
of
Mr.
Elton,
and
this
is
the
only
way
I
have
of
doing
him
a
service."
"Mr.
Elton
is
a
very
pretty
young
man,
to
be
sure,
and
a
very
good
young
man,
and
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him.
But
if
you
want
to
shew
him
any
attention,
my
dear,
ask
him
to
come
and
dine
with
us
some
day.
That
will
be
a
much
better
thing.
I
dare
say
Mr.
Knightley
will
be
so
kind
as
to
meet
him."
"With
a
great
deal
of
pleasure,
sir,
at
any
time,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
laughing,
"and
I
agree
with
you
entirely,
that
it
will
be
a
much
better
thing.
Invite
him
to
dinner,
Emma,
and
help
him
to
the
best
of
the
fish
and
the
chicken,
but
leave
him
to
chuse
his
own
wife.
Depend
upon
it,
a
man
of
six
or
seven
and
twenty
can
take
care
of
himself."
Mr.
Weston
was
a
native
of
Highbury,
and
born
of
a
respectable
family,
which
for
the
last
two
or
three
generations
had
been
rising
into
gentility
and
property.
He
had
received
a
good
education,
but,
on
succeeding
early
in
life
to
a
small
independence,
had
become
indisposed
for
any
of
the
more
homely
pursuits
in
which
his
brothers
were
engaged,
and
had
satisfied
an
active,
cheerful
mind
and
social
temper
by
entering
into
the
militia
of
his
county,
then
embodied.
Captain
Weston
was
a
general
favourite;
and
when
the
chances
of
his
military
life
had
introduced
him
to
Miss
Churchill,
of
a
great
Yorkshire
family,
and
Miss
Churchill
fell
in
love
with
him,
nobody
was
surprized,
except
her
brother
and
his
wife,
who
had
never
seen
him,
and
who
were
full
of
pride
and
importance,
which
the
connexion
would
offend.
Miss
Churchill,
however,
being
of
age,
and
with
the
full
command
of
her
fortune
though
her
fortune
bore
no
proportion
to
the
family
estate
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
the
marriage,
and
it
took
place,
