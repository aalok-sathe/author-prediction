in
the
world
if
he
were
left
to
himself;
and
though
there
was
no
being
attached
to
the
aunt,
he
acknowledged
her
kindness
with
gratitude,
and
seemed
to
mean
always
to
speak
of
her
with
respect.
This
was
all
very
promising;
and,
but
for
such
an
unfortunate
fancy
for
having
his
hair
cut,
there
was
nothing
to
denote
him
unworthy
of
the
distinguished
honour
which
her
imagination
had
given
him;
the
honour,
if
not
of
being
really
in
love
with
her,
of
being
at
least
very
near
it,
and
saved
only
by
her
own
indifference
(for
still
her
resolution
held
of
never
marrying)
the
honour,
in
short,
of
being
marked
out
for
her
by
all
their
joint
acquaintance.
Mr.
Weston,
on
his
side,
added
a
virtue
to
the
account
which
must
have
some
weight.
He
gave
her
to
understand
that
Frank
admired
her
extremely
thought
her
very
beautiful
and
very
charming;
and
with
so
much
to
be
said
for
him
altogether,
she
found
she
must
not
judge
him
harshly.
As
Mrs.
Weston
observed,
"all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whims."
There
was
one
person
among
his
new
acquaintance
in
Surry,
not
so
leniently
disposed.
In
general
he
was
judged,
throughout
the
parishes
of
Donwell
and
Highbury,
with
great
candour;
liberal
allowances
were
made
for
the
little
excesses
of
such
a
handsome
young
man
one
who
smiled
so
often
and
bowed
so
well;
but
there
was
one
spirit
among
them
not
to
be
softened,
from
its
power
of
censure,
by
bows
or
smiles
Mr.
Knightley.
The
circumstance
was
told
him
at
Hartfield;
for
the
moment,
he
was
silent;
but
Emma
heard
him
almost
immediately
afterwards
say
to
himself,
over
a
newspaper
he
held
in
his
hand,
"Hum!
just
the
trifling,
silly
fellow
I
took
him
for."
She
had
half
a
mind
to
resent;
but
an
instant's
observation
convinced
her
that
it
was
really
said
only
to
relieve
his
own
feelings,
and
not
meant
to
provoke;
and
therefore
she
let
it
pass.
Although
in
one
instance
the
bearers
of
not
good
tidings,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston's
visit
this
morning
was
in
another
respect
particularly
opportune.
Something
occurred
while
they
were
at
Hartfield,
to
make
Emma
want
their
advice;
and,
which
was
still
more
lucky,
she
wanted
exactly
the
advice
they
gave.
This
was
the
occurrence:
The
Coles
had
been
settled
some
years
in
Highbury,
and
were
very
good
sort
of
people
friendly,
liberal,
and
unpretending;
but,
on
the
other
hand,
they
were
of
low
origin,
in
trade,
and
only
moderately
genteel.
On
their
first
coming
into
the
country,
they
had
lived
in
proportion
to
their
income,
quietly,
keeping
little
company,
and
that
little
unexpensively;
but
the
last
year
or
two
had
brought
them
a
considerable
increase
of
means
the
house
in
town
had
yielded
greater
profits,
and
fortune
in
general
had
smiled
on
them.
With
their
wealth,
their
views
increased;
their
want
of
a
larger
house,
their
inclination
for
more
company.
They
added
to
their
house,
to
their
number
of
servants,
