without
you."
Emma
was
most
happy
to
be
called
to
such
a
council;
and
her
father,
engaging
to
think
it
all
over
while
she
was
gone,
the
two
young
people
set
off
together
without
delay
for
the
Crown.
There
were
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston;
delighted
to
see
her
and
receive
her
approbation,
very
busy
and
very
happy
in
their
different
way;
she,
in
some
little
distress;
and
he,
finding
every
thing
perfect.
"Emma,"
said
she,
"this
paper
is
worse
than
I
expected.
Look!
in
places
you
see
it
is
dreadfully
dirty;
and
the
wainscot
is
more
yellow
and
forlorn
than
any
thing
I
could
have
imagined."
"My
dear,
you
are
too
particular,"
said
her
husband.
"What
does
all
that
signify?
You
will
see
nothing
of
it
by
candlelight.
It
will
be
as
clean
as
Randalls
by
candlelight.
We
never
see
any
thing
of
it
on
our
club
nights."
The
ladies
here
probably
exchanged
looks
which
meant,
"Men
never
know
when
things
are
dirty
or
not;"
and
the
gentlemen
perhaps
thought
each
to
himself,
"Women
will
have
their
little
nonsenses
and
needless
cares."
One
perplexity,
however,
arose,
which
the
gentlemen
did
not
disdain.
It
regarded
a
supper
room.
At
the
time
of
the
ballroom's
being
built,
suppers
had
not
been
in
question;
and
a
small
card
room
adjoining,
was
the
only
addition.
What
was
to
be
done?
This
card
room
would
be
wanted
as
a
card
room
now;
or,
if
cards
were
conveniently
voted
unnecessary
by
their
four
selves,
still
was
it
not
too
small
for
any
comfortable
supper?
Another
room
of
much
better
size
might
be
secured
for
the
purpose;
but
it
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
house,
and
a
long
awkward
passage
must
be
gone
through
to
get
at
it.
This
made
a
difficulty.
Mrs.
Weston
was
afraid
of
draughts
for
the
young
people
in
that
passage;
and
neither
Emma
nor
the
gentlemen
could
tolerate
the
prospect
of
being
miserably
crowded
at
supper.
Mrs.
Weston
proposed
having
no
regular
supper;
merely
sandwiches,
&c.,
set
out
in
the
little
room;
but
that
was
scouted
as
a
wretched
suggestion.
A
private
dance,
without
sitting
down
to
supper,
was
pronounced
an
infamous
fraud
upon
the
rights
of
men
and
women;
and
Mrs.
Weston
must
not
speak
of
it
again.
She
then
took
another
line
of
expediency,
and
looking
into
the
doubtful
room,
observed,
"I
do
not
think
it
is
so
very
small.
We
shall
not
be
many,
you
know."
And
Mr.
Weston
at
the
same
time,
walking
briskly
with
long
steps
through
the
passage,
was
calling
out,
"You
talk
a
great
deal
of
the
length
of
this
passage,
my
dear.
It
is
a
mere
nothing
after
all;
and
not
the
least
draught
from
the
stairs."
"I
wish,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"one
could
know
which
arrangement
our
guests
in
general
would
like
best.
To
do
what
would
be
most
generally
pleasing
must
be
our
object
if
one
could
but
tell
what
that
would
be."
"Yes,
very
true,"
cried
Frank,
"very
true.
