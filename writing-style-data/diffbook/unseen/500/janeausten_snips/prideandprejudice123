the
necessity
of
relating
feelings
which
may
be
offensive
to
yours,
I
can
only
say
that
I
am
sorry.
The
necessity
must
be
obeyed,
and
further
apology
would
be
absurd.
"I
had
not
been
long
in
Hertfordshire,
before
I
saw,
in
common
with
others,
that
Bingley
preferred
your
elder
sister
to
any
other
young
woman
in
the
country.
But
it
was
not
till
the
evening
of
the
dance
at
Netherfield
that
I
had
any
apprehension
of
his
feeling
a
serious
attachment.
I
had
often
seen
him
in
love
before.
At
that
ball,
while
I
had
the
honour
of
dancing
with
you,
I
was
first
made
acquainted,
by
Sir
William
Lucas's
accidental
information,
that
Bingley's
attentions
to
your
sister
had
given
rise
to
a
general
expectation
of
their
marriage.
He
spoke
of
it
as
a
certain
event,
of
which
the
time
alone
could
be
undecided.
From
that
moment
I
observed
my
friend's
behaviour
attentively;
and
I
could
then
perceive
that
his
partiality
for
Miss
Bennet
was
beyond
what
I
had
ever
witnessed
in
him.
Your
sister
I
also
watched.
Her
look
and
manners
were
open,
cheerful,
and
engaging
as
ever,
but
without
any
symptom
of
peculiar
regard,
and
I
remained
convinced
from
the
evening's
scrutiny,
that
though
she
received
his
attentions
with
pleasure,
she
did
not
invite
them
by
any
participation
of
sentiment.
If
you
have
not
been
mistaken
here,
I
must
have
been
in
error.
Your
superior
knowledge
of
your
sister
must
make
the
latter
probable.
If
it
be
so,
if
I
have
been
misled
by
such
error
to
inflict
pain
on
her,
your
resentment
has
not
been
unreasonable.
But
I
shall
not
scruple
to
assert,
that
the
serenity
of
your
sister's
countenance
and
air
was
such
as
might
have
given
the
most
acute
observer
a
conviction
that,
however
amiable
her
temper,
her
heart
was
not
likely
to
be
easily
touched.
That
I
was
desirous
of
believing
her
indifferent
is
certain
but
I
will
venture
to
say
that
my
investigation
and
decisions
are
not
usually
influenced
by
my
hopes
or
fears.
I
did
not
believe
her
to
be
indifferent
because
I
wished
it;
I
believed
it
on
impartial
conviction,
as
truly
as
I
wished
it
in
reason.
My
objections
to
the
marriage
were
not
merely
those
which
I
last
night
acknowledged
to
have
the
utmost
force
of
passion
to
put
aside,
in
my
own
case;
the
want
of
connection
could
not
be
so
great
an
evil
to
my
friend
as
to
me.
But
there
were
other
causes
of
repugnance;
causes
which,
though
still
existing,
and
existing
to
an
equal
degree
in
both
instances,
I
had
myself
endeavoured
to
forget,
because
they
were
not
immediately
before
me.
These
causes
must
be
stated,
though
briefly.
The
situation
of
your
mother's
family,
though
objectionable,
was
nothing
in
comparison
to
that
total
want
of
propriety
so
frequently,
so
almost
uniformly
betrayed
by
herself,
by
your
three
younger
sisters,
and
occasionally
even
by
your
father.
Pardon
me.
It
pains
me
to
offend
you.
But
amidst
