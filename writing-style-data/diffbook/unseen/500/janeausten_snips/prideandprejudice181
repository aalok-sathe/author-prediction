especially
on
Lydia's
side,
but
nothing
to
give
him
any
alarm.
I
am
so
grieved
for
him!
His
behaviour
was
attentive
and
kind
to
the
utmost.
He
was
coming
to
us,
in
order
to
assure
us
of
his
concern,
before
he
had
any
idea
of
their
not
being
gone
to
Scotland:
when
that
apprehension
first
got
abroad,
it
hastened
his
journey."
"And
was
Denny
convinced
that
Wickham
would
not
marry?
Did
he
know
of
their
intending
to
go
off?
Had
Colonel
Forster
seen
Denny
himself?"
"Yes;
but,
when
questioned
by
him,
Denny
denied
knowing
anything
of
their
plans,
and
would
not
give
his
real
opinion
about
it.
He
did
not
repeat
his
persuasion
of
their
not
marrying
and
from
that,
I
am
inclined
to
hope,
he
might
have
been
misunderstood
before."
"And
till
Colonel
Forster
came
himself,
not
one
of
you
entertained
a
doubt,
I
suppose,
of
their
being
really
married?"
"How
was
it
possible
that
such
an
idea
should
enter
our
brains?
I
felt
a
little
uneasy
a
little
fearful
of
my
sister's
happiness
with
him
in
marriage,
because
I
knew
that
his
conduct
had
not
been
always
quite
right.
My
father
and
mother
knew
nothing
of
that;
they
only
felt
how
imprudent
a
match
it
must
be.
Kitty
then
owned,
with
a
very
natural
triumph
on
knowing
more
than
the
rest
of
us,
that
in
Lydia's
last
letter
she
had
prepared
her
for
such
a
step.
She
had
known,
it
seems,
of
their
being
in
love
with
each
other,
many
weeks."
"But
not
before
they
went
to
Brighton?"
"No,
I
believe
not."
"And
did
Colonel
Forster
appear
to
think
well
of
Wickham
himself?
Does
he
know
his
real
character?"
"I
must
confess
that
he
did
not
speak
so
well
of
Wickham
as
he
formerly
did.
He
believed
him
to
be
imprudent
and
extravagant.
And
since
this
sad
affair
has
taken
place,
it
is
said
that
he
left
Meryton
greatly
in
debt;
but
I
hope
this
may
be
false."
"Oh,
Jane,
had
we
been
less
secret,
had
we
told
what
we
knew
of
him,
this
could
not
have
happened!"
"Perhaps
it
would
have
been
better,"
replied
her
sister.
"But
to
expose
the
former
faults
of
any
person
without
knowing
what
their
present
feelings
were,
seemed
unjustifiable.
We
acted
with
the
best
intentions."
"Could
Colonel
Forster
repeat
the
particulars
of
Lydia's
note
to
his
wife?"
"He
brought
it
with
him
for
us
to
see."
Jane
then
took
it
from
her
pocket
book,
and
gave
it
to
Elizabeth.
These
were
the
contents:
"MY
DEAR
HARRIET,
"You
will
laugh
when
you
know
where
I
am
gone,
and
I
cannot
help
laughing
myself
at
your
surprise
to
morrow
morning,
as
soon
as
I
am
missed.
I
am
going
to
Gretna
Green,
and
if
you
cannot
guess
with
who,
I
shall
think
you
a
simpleton,
for
there
is
but
one
man
in
the
world
I
love,
and
he
is
an
angel.
I
should
never
be
happy
without
him,
so
think
it
no
harm
to
