awkward.
Now,
it
so
happened
that
in
spite
of
Emma's
resolution
of
never
marrying,
there
was
something
in
the
name,
in
the
idea
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,
which
always
interested
her.
She
had
frequently
thought
especially
since
his
father's
marriage
with
Miss
Taylor
that
if
she
were
to
marry,
he
was
the
very
person
to
suit
her
in
age,
character
and
condition.
He
seemed
by
this
connexion
between
the
families,
quite
to
belong
to
her.
She
could
not
but
suppose
it
to
be
a
match
that
every
body
who
knew
them
must
think
of.
That
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
did
think
of
it,
she
was
very
strongly
persuaded;
and
though
not
meaning
to
be
induced
by
him,
or
by
any
body
else,
to
give
up
a
situation
which
she
believed
more
replete
with
good
than
any
she
could
change
it
for,
she
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
him,
a
decided
intention
of
finding
him
pleasant,
of
being
liked
by
him
to
a
certain
degree,
and
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
their
being
coupled
in
their
friends'
imaginations.
With
such
sensations,
Mr.
Elton's
civilities
were
dreadfully
ill
timed;
but
she
had
the
comfort
of
appearing
very
polite,
while
feeling
very
cross
and
of
thinking
that
the
rest
of
the
visit
could
not
possibly
pass
without
bringing
forward
the
same
information
again,
or
the
substance
of
it,
from
the
open
hearted
Mr.
Weston.
So
it
proved;
for
when
happily
released
from
Mr.
Elton,
and
seated
by
Mr.
Weston,
at
dinner,
he
made
use
of
the
very
first
interval
in
the
cares
of
hospitality,
the
very
first
leisure
from
the
saddle
of
mutton,
to
say
to
her,
"We
want
only
two
more
to
be
just
the
right
number.
I
should
like
to
see
two
more
here,
your
pretty
little
friend,
Miss
Smith,
and
my
son
and
then
I
should
say
we
were
quite
complete.
I
believe
you
did
not
hear
me
telling
the
others
in
the
drawing
room
that
we
are
expecting
Frank.
I
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning,
and
he
will
be
with
us
within
a
fortnight."
Emma
spoke
with
a
very
proper
degree
of
pleasure;
and
fully
assented
to
his
proposition
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Smith
making
their
party
quite
complete.
"He
has
been
wanting
to
come
to
us,"
continued
Mr.
Weston,
"ever
since
September:
every
letter
has
been
full
of
it;
but
he
cannot
command
his
own
time.
He
has
those
to
please
who
must
be
pleased,
and
who
(between
ourselves)
are
sometimes
to
be
pleased
only
by
a
good
many
sacrifices.
But
now
I
have
no
doubt
of
seeing
him
here
about
the
second
week
in
January."
"What
a
very
great
pleasure
it
will
be
to
you!
and
Mrs.
Weston
is
so
anxious
to
be
acquainted
with
him,
that
she
must
be
almost
as
happy
as
yourself."
"Yes,
she
would
be,
but
that
she
thinks
there
will
be
another
put
off.
She
does
not
depend
upon
his
coming
so
much
as
