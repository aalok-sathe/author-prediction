your
head?"
"I
have
lately
imagined
that
I
saw
symptoms
of
attachment
between
them
certain
expressive
looks,
which
I
did
not
believe
meant
to
be
public."
"Oh!
you
amuse
me
excessively.
I
am
delighted
to
find
that
you
can
vouchsafe
to
let
your
imagination
wander
but
it
will
not
do
very
sorry
to
check
you
in
your
first
essay
but
indeed
it
will
not
do.
There
is
no
admiration
between
them,
I
do
assure
you;
and
the
appearances
which
have
caught
you,
have
arisen
from
some
peculiar
circumstances
feelings
rather
of
a
totally
different
nature
it
is
impossible
exactly
to
explain:
there
is
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
in
it
but
the
part
which
is
capable
of
being
communicated,
which
is
sense,
is,
that
they
are
as
far
from
any
attachment
or
admiration
for
one
another,
as
any
two
beings
in
the
world
can
be.
That
is,
I
presume
it
to
be
so
on
her
side,
and
I
can
answer
for
its
being
so
on
his.
I
will
answer
for
the
gentleman's
indifference."
She
spoke
with
a
confidence
which
staggered,
with
a
satisfaction
which
silenced,
Mr.
Knightley.
She
was
in
gay
spirits,
and
would
have
prolonged
the
conversation,
wanting
to
hear
the
particulars
of
his
suspicions,
every
look
described,
and
all
the
wheres
and
hows
of
a
circumstance
which
highly
entertained
her:
but
his
gaiety
did
not
meet
hers.
He
found
he
could
not
be
useful,
and
his
feelings
were
too
much
irritated
for
talking.
That
he
might
not
be
irritated
into
an
absolute
fever,
by
the
fire
which
Mr.
Woodhouse's
tender
habits
required
almost
every
evening
throughout
the
year,
he
soon
afterwards
took
a
hasty
leave,
and
walked
home
to
the
coolness
and
solitude
of
Donwell
Abbey.
After
being
long
fed
with
hopes
of
a
speedy
visit
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Suckling,
the
Highbury
world
were
obliged
to
endure
the
mortification
of
hearing
that
they
could
not
possibly
come
till
the
autumn.
No
such
importation
of
novelties
could
enrich
their
intellectual
stores
at
present.
In
the
daily
interchange
of
news,
they
must
be
again
restricted
to
the
other
topics
with
which
for
a
while
the
Sucklings'
coming
had
been
united,
such
as
the
last
accounts
of
Mrs.
Churchill,
whose
health
seemed
every
day
to
supply
a
different
report,
and
the
situation
of
Mrs.
Weston,
whose
happiness
it
was
to
be
hoped
might
eventually
be
as
much
increased
by
the
arrival
of
a
child,
as
that
of
all
her
neighbours
was
by
the
approach
of
it.
Mrs.
Elton
was
very
much
disappointed.
It
was
the
delay
of
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
parade.
Her
introductions
and
recommendations
must
all
wait,
and
every
projected
party
be
still
only
talked
of.
So
she
thought
at
first;
but
a
little
consideration
convinced
her
that
every
thing
need
not
be
put
off.
Why
should
not
they
explore
to
Box
Hill
though
the
Sucklings
did
not
come?
They
could
go
there
again
with
them
in
the
autumn.
It
was
settled
that
they
should
go
