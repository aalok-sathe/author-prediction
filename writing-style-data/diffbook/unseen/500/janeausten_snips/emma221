grateful
blessings
that
she
could
utter
for
her
friend
and
herself.
Such
an
adventure
as
this,
a
fine
young
man
and
a
lovely
young
woman
thrown
together
in
such
a
way,
could
hardly
fail
of
suggesting
certain
ideas
to
the
coldest
heart
and
the
steadiest
brain.
So
Emma
thought,
at
least.
Could
a
linguist,
could
a
grammarian,
could
even
a
mathematician
have
seen
what
she
did,
have
witnessed
their
appearance
together,
and
heard
their
history
of
it,
without
feeling
that
circumstances
had
been
at
work
to
make
them
peculiarly
interesting
to
each
other?
How
much
more
must
an
imaginist,
like
herself,
be
on
fire
with
speculation
and
foresight!
especially
with
such
a
groundwork
of
anticipation
as
her
mind
had
already
made.
It
was
a
very
extraordinary
thing!
Nothing
of
the
sort
had
ever
occurred
before
to
any
young
ladies
in
the
place,
within
her
memory;
no
rencontre,
no
alarm
of
the
kind;
and
now
it
had
happened
to
the
very
person,
and
at
the
very
hour,
when
the
other
very
person
was
chancing
to
pass
by
to
rescue
her!
It
certainly
was
very
extraordinary!
And
knowing,
as
she
did,
the
favourable
state
of
mind
of
each
at
this
period,
it
struck
her
the
more.
He
was
wishing
to
get
the
better
of
his
attachment
to
herself,
she
just
recovering
from
her
mania
for
Mr.
Elton.
It
seemed
as
if
every
thing
united
to
promise
the
most
interesting
consequences.
It
was
not
possible
that
the
occurrence
should
not
be
strongly
recommending
each
to
the
other.
In
the
few
minutes'
conversation
which
she
had
yet
had
with
him,
while
Harriet
had
been
partially
insensible,
he
had
spoken
of
her
terror,
her
naivete,
her
fervour
as
she
seized
and
clung
to
his
arm,
with
a
sensibility
amused
and
delighted;
and
just
at
last,
after
Harriet's
own
account
had
been
given,
he
had
expressed
his
indignation
at
the
abominable
folly
of
Miss
Bickerton
in
the
warmest
terms.
Every
thing
was
to
take
its
natural
course,
however,
neither
impelled
nor
assisted.
She
would
not
stir
a
step,
nor
drop
a
hint.
No,
she
had
had
enough
of
interference.
There
could
be
no
harm
in
a
scheme,
a
mere
passive
scheme.
It
was
no
more
than
a
wish.
Beyond
it
she
would
on
no
account
proceed.
Emma's
first
resolution
was
to
keep
her
father
from
the
knowledge
of
what
had
passed,
aware
of
the
anxiety
and
alarm
it
would
occasion:
but
she
soon
felt
that
concealment
must
be
impossible.
Within
half
an
hour
it
was
known
all
over
Highbury.
It
was
the
very
event
to
engage
those
who
talk
most,
the
young
and
the
low;
and
all
the
youth
and
servants
in
the
place
were
soon
in
the
happiness
of
frightful
news.
The
last
night's
ball
seemed
lost
in
the
gipsies.
Poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
trembled
as
he
sat,
and,
as
Emma
had
foreseen,
would
scarcely
be
satisfied
without
their
promising
never
to
go
beyond
the
shrubbery
again.
It
was
some
comfort
to
him
that
many
inquiries
