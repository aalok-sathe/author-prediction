is
all
very
well.
I
would
go
and
see
her
if
I
could
have
the
carriage."
Elizabeth,
feeling
really
anxious,
was
determined
to
go
to
her,
though
the
carriage
was
not
to
be
had;
and
as
she
was
no
horsewoman,
walking
was
her
only
alternative.
She
declared
her
resolution.
"How
can
you
be
so
silly,"
cried
her
mother,
"as
to
think
of
such
a
thing,
in
all
this
dirt!
You
will
not
be
fit
to
be
seen
when
you
get
there."
"I
shall
be
very
fit
to
see
Jane
which
is
all
I
want."
"Is
this
a
hint
to
me,
Lizzy,"
said
her
father,
"to
send
for
the
horses?"
"No,
indeed,
I
do
not
wish
to
avoid
the
walk.
The
distance
is
nothing
when
one
has
a
motive;
only
three
miles.
I
shall
be
back
by
dinner."
"I
admire
the
activity
of
your
benevolence,"
observed
Mary,
"but
every
impulse
of
feeling
should
be
guided
by
reason;
and,
in
my
opinion,
exertion
should
always
be
in
proportion
to
what
is
required."
"We
will
go
as
far
as
Meryton
with
you,"
said
Catherine
and
Lydia.
Elizabeth
accepted
their
company,
and
the
three
young
ladies
set
off
together.
"If
we
make
haste,"
said
Lydia,
as
they
walked
along,
"perhaps
we
may
see
something
of
Captain
Carter
before
he
goes."
In
Meryton
they
parted;
the
two
youngest
repaired
to
the
lodgings
of
one
of
the
officers'
wives,
and
Elizabeth
continued
her
walk
alone,
crossing
field
after
field
at
a
quick
pace,
jumping
over
stiles
and
springing
over
puddles
with
impatient
activity,
and
finding
herself
at
last
within
view
of
the
house,
with
weary
ankles,
dirty
stockings,
and
a
face
glowing
with
the
warmth
of
exercise.
She
was
shown
into
the
breakfast
parlour,
where
all
but
Jane
were
assembled,
and
where
her
appearance
created
a
great
deal
of
surprise.
That
she
should
have
walked
three
miles
so
early
in
the
day,
in
such
dirty
weather,
and
by
herself,
was
almost
incredible
to
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley;
and
Elizabeth
was
convinced
that
they
held
her
in
contempt
for
it.
She
was
received,
however,
very
politely
by
them;
and
in
their
brother's
manners
there
was
something
better
than
politeness;
there
was
good
humour
and
kindness.
Mr.
Darcy
said
very
little,
and
Mr.
Hurst
nothing
at
all.
The
former
was
divided
between
admiration
of
the
brilliancy
which
exercise
had
given
to
her
complexion,
and
doubt
as
to
the
occasion's
justifying
her
coming
so
far
alone.
The
latter
was
thinking
only
of
his
breakfast.
Her
inquiries
after
her
sister
were
not
very
favourably
answered.
Miss
Bennet
had
slept
ill,
and
though
up,
was
very
feverish,
and
not
well
enough
to
leave
her
room.
Elizabeth
was
glad
to
be
taken
to
her
immediately;
and
Jane,
who
had
only
been
withheld
by
the
fear
of
giving
alarm
or
inconvenience
from
expressing
in
her
note
how
much
she
longed
for
such
a
visit,
was
delighted
at
her
entrance.
She
was
not
equal,
however,
to
much
conversation,
and
when
Miss
Bingley
left
