washed
by
a
stream,
of
which
the
Abbey,
with
all
the
old
neglect
of
prospect,
had
scarcely
a
sight
and
its
abundance
of
timber
in
rows
and
avenues,
which
neither
fashion
nor
extravagance
had
rooted
up.
The
house
was
larger
than
Hartfield,
and
totally
unlike
it,
covering
a
good
deal
of
ground,
rambling
and
irregular,
with
many
comfortable,
and
one
or
two
handsome
rooms.
It
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be,
and
it
looked
what
it
was
and
Emma
felt
an
increasing
respect
for
it,
as
the
residence
of
a
family
of
such
true
gentility,
untainted
in
blood
and
understanding.
Some
faults
of
temper
John
Knightley
had;
but
Isabella
had
connected
herself
unexceptionably.
She
had
given
them
neither
men,
nor
names,
nor
places,
that
could
raise
a
blush.
These
were
pleasant
feelings,
and
she
walked
about
and
indulged
them
till
it
was
necessary
to
do
as
the
others
did,
and
collect
round
the
strawberry
beds.
The
whole
party
were
assembled,
excepting
Frank
Churchill,
who
was
expected
every
moment
from
Richmond;
and
Mrs.
Elton,
in
all
her
apparatus
of
happiness,
her
large
bonnet
and
her
basket,
was
very
ready
to
lead
the
way
in
gathering,
accepting,
or
talking
strawberries,
and
only
strawberries,
could
now
be
thought
or
spoken
of.
"The
best
fruit
in
England
every
body's
favourite
always
wholesome.
These
the
finest
beds
and
finest
sorts.
Delightful
to
gather
for
one's
self
the
only
way
of
really
enjoying
them.

the

in
the
shade."
Such,
for
half
an
hour,
was
the
conversation
interrupted
only
once
by
Mrs.
Weston,
who
came
out,
in
her
solicitude
after
her
son
in
law,
to
inquire
if
he
were
come
and
she
was
a
little
uneasy.
She
had
some
fears
of
his
horse.
Seats
tolerably
in
the
shade
were
found;
and
now
Emma
was
obliged
to
overhear
what
Mrs.
Elton
and
Jane
Fairfax
were
talking
of.
A
situation,
a
most
desirable
situation,
was
in
question.
Mrs.
Elton
had
received
notice
of
it
that
morning,
and
was
in
raptures.
It
was
not
with
Mrs.
Suckling,
it
was
not
with
Mrs.
Bragge,
but
in
felicity
and
splendour
it
fell
short
only
of
them:
it
was
with
a
cousin
of
Mrs.
Bragge,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Suckling,
a
lady
known
at
Maple
Grove.
Delightful,
charming,
superior,
first
circles,
spheres,
lines,
ranks,
every
thing
and
Mrs.
Elton
was
wild
to
have
the
offer
closed
with
immediately.
On
her
side,
all
was
warmth,
