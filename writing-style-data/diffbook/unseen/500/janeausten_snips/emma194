the
other.
Time
will
generally
lessen
the
interest
of
every
attachment
not
within
the
daily
circle
but
that
is
not
the
change
I
had
in
view
for
you.
As
an
old
friend,
you
will
allow
me
to
hope,
Miss
Fairfax,
that
ten
years
hence
you
may
have
as
many
concentrated
objects
as
I
have."
It
was
kindly
said,
and
very
far
from
giving
offence.
A
pleasant
"thank
you"
seemed
meant
to
laugh
it
off,
but
a
blush,
a
quivering
lip,
a
tear
in
the
eye,
shewed
that
it
was
felt
beyond
a
laugh.
Her
attention
was
now
claimed
by
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
being,
according
to
his
custom
on
such
occasions,
making
the
circle
of
his
guests,
and
paying
his
particular
compliments
to
the
ladies,
was
ending
with
her
and
with
all
his
mildest
urbanity,
said,
"I
am
very
sorry
to
hear,
Miss
Fairfax,
of
your
being
out
this
morning
in
the
rain.
Young
ladies
should
take
care
of
themselves.
Young
ladies
are
delicate
plants.
They
should
take
care
of
their
health
and
their
complexion.
My
dear,
did
you
change
your
stockings?"
"Yes,
sir,
I
did
indeed;
and
I
am
very
much
obliged
by
your
kind
solicitude
about
me."
"My
dear
Miss
Fairfax,
young
ladies
are
very
sure
to
be
cared
for.
I
hope
your
good
grand
mama
and
aunt
are
well.
They
are
some
of
my
very
old
friends.
I
wish
my
health
allowed
me
to
be
a
better
neighbour.
You
do
us
a
great
deal
of
honour
to
day,
I
am
sure.
My
daughter
and
I
are
both
highly
sensible
of
your
goodness,
and
have
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
seeing
you
at
Hartfield."
The
kind
hearted,
polite
old
man
might
then
sit
down
and
feel
that
he
had
done
his
duty,
and
made
every
fair
lady
welcome
and
easy.
By
this
time,
the
walk
in
the
rain
had
reached
Mrs.
Elton,
and
her
remonstrances
now
opened
upon
Jane.
"My
dear
Jane,
what
is
this
I
hear?
Going
to
the
post
office
in
the
rain!
This
must
not
be,
I
assure
you.
You
sad
girl,
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing?
It
is
a
sign
I
was
not
there
to
take
care
of
you."
Jane
very
patiently
assured
her
that
she
had
not
caught
any
cold.
"Oh!
do
not
tell
me.
You
really
are
a
very
sad
girl,
and
do
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
yourself.
To
the
post
office
indeed!
Mrs.
Weston,
did
you
ever
hear
the
like?
You
and
I
must
positively
exert
our
authority."
"My
advice,"
said
Mrs.
Weston
kindly
and
persuasively,
"I
certainly
do
feel
tempted
to
give.
Miss
Fairfax,
you
must
not
run
such
risks.
Liable
as
you
have
been
to
severe
colds,
indeed
you
ought
to
be
particularly
careful,
especially
at
this
time
of
year.
The
spring
I
always
think
requires
more
than
common
care.
Better
wait
an
hour
or
two,
or
even
half
a
day
for
your
letters,
than
run
the
risk
of
bringing
on
your
cough
again.
Now
do
