Bingley
was
also
coming
to
wait
on
her;
and
she
had
barely
time
to
express
her
satisfaction,
and
prepare
for
such
a
visitor,
when
Bingley's
quick
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs,
and
in
a
moment
he
entered
the
room.
All
Elizabeth's
anger
against
him
had
been
long
done
away;
but
had
she
still
felt
any,
it
could
hardly
have
stood
its
ground
against
the
unaffected
cordiality
with
which
he
expressed
himself
on
seeing
her
again.
He
inquired
in
a
friendly,
though
general
way,
after
her
family,
and
looked
and
spoke
with
the
same
good
humoured
ease
that
he
had
ever
done.
To
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
he
was
scarcely
a
less
interesting
personage
than
to
herself.
They
had
long
wished
to
see
him.
The
whole
party
before
them,
indeed,
excited
a
lively
attention.
The
suspicions
which
had
just
arisen
of
Mr.
Darcy
and
their
niece
directed
their
observation
towards
each
with
an
earnest
though
guarded
inquiry;
and
they
soon
drew
from
those
inquiries
the
full
conviction
that
one
of
them
at
least
knew
what
it
was
to
love.
Of
the
lady's
sensations
they
remained
a
little
in
doubt;
but
that
the
gentleman
was
overflowing
with
admiration
was
evident
enough.
Elizabeth,
on
her
side,
had
much
to
do.
She
wanted
to
ascertain
the
feelings
of
each
of
her
visitors;
she
wanted
to
compose
her
own,
and
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
all;
and
in
the
latter
object,
where
she
feared
most
to
fail,
she
was
most
sure
of
success,
for
those
to
whom
she
endeavoured
to
give
pleasure
were
prepossessed
in
her
favour.
Bingley
was
ready,
Georgiana
was
eager,
and
Darcy
determined,
to
be
pleased.
In
seeing
Bingley,
her
thoughts
naturally
flew
to
her
sister;
and,
oh!
how
ardently
did
she
long
to
know
whether
any
of
his
were
directed
in
a
like
manner.
Sometimes
she
could
fancy
that
he
talked
less
than
on
former
occasions,
and
once
or
twice
pleased
herself
with
the
notion
that,
as
he
looked
at
her,
he
was
trying
to
trace
a
resemblance.
But,
though
this
might
be
imaginary,
she
could
not
be
deceived
as
to
his
behaviour
to
Miss
Darcy,
who
had
been
set
up
as
a
rival
to
Jane.
No
look
appeared
on
either
side
that
spoke
particular
regard.
Nothing
occurred
between
them
that
could
justify
the
hopes
of
his
sister.
On
this
point
she
was
soon
satisfied;
and
two
or
three
little
circumstances
occurred
ere
they
parted,
which,
in
her
anxious
interpretation,
denoted
a
recollection
of
Jane
not
untinctured
by
tenderness,
and
a
wish
of
saying
more
that
might
lead
to
the
mention
of
her,
had
he
dared.
He
observed
to
her,
at
a
moment
when
the
others
were
talking
together,
and
in
a
tone
which
had
something
of
real
regret,
that
it
"was
a
very
long
time
since
he
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her;"
and,
before
she
could
reply,
he
added,
"It
is
above
eight
months.
We
have
not
met
since
the
26th
of
November,
when
we
were
all
