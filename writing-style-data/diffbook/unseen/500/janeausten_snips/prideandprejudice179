Brighton,
with
all
my
family,
this
would
not
have
happened;
but
poor
dear
Lydia
had
nobody
to
take
care
of
her.
Why
did
the
Forsters
ever
let
her
go
out
of
their
sight?
I
am
sure
there
was
some
great
neglect
or
other
on
their
side,
for
she
is
not
the
kind
of
girl
to
do
such
a
thing
if
she
had
been
well
looked
after.
I
always
thought
they
were
very
unfit
to
have
the
charge
of
her;
but
I
was
overruled,
as
I
always
am.
Poor
dear
child!
And
now
here's
Mr.
Bennet
gone
away,
and
I
know
he
will
fight
Wickham,
wherever
he
meets
him
and
then
he
will
be
killed,
and
what
is
to
become
of
us
all?
The
Collinses
will
turn
us
out
before
he
is
cold
in
his
grave,
and
if
you
are
not
kind
to
us,
brother,
I
do
not
know
what
we
shall
do."
They
all
exclaimed
against
such
terrific
ideas;
and
Mr.
Gardiner,
after
general
assurances
of
his
affection
for
her
and
all
her
family,
told
her
that
he
meant
to
be
in
London
the
very
next
day,
and
would
assist
Mr.
Bennet
in
every
endeavour
for
recovering
Lydia.
"Do
not
give
way
to
useless
alarm,"
added
he;
"though
it
is
right
to
be
prepared
for
the
worst,
there
is
no
occasion
to
look
on
it
as
certain.
It
is
not
quite
a
week
since
they
left
Brighton.
In
a
few
days
more
we
may
gain
some
news
of
them;
and
till
we
know
that
they
are
not
married,
and
have
no
design
of
marrying,
do
not
let
us
give
the
matter
over
as
lost.
As
soon
as
I
get
to
town
I
shall
go
to
my
brother,
and
make
him
come
home
with
me
to
Gracechurch
Street;
and
then
we
may
consult
together
as
to
what
is
to
be
done."
"Oh!
my
dear
brother,"
replied
Mrs.
Bennet,
"that
is
exactly
what
I
could
most
wish
for.
And
now
do,
when
you
get
to
town,
find
them
out,
wherever
they
may
be;
and
if
they
are
not
married
already,
make
them
marry.
And
as
for
wedding
clothes,
do
not
let
them
wait
for
that,
but
tell
Lydia
she
shall
have
as
much
money
as
she
chooses
to
buy
them,
after
they
are
married.
And,
above
all,
keep
Mr.
Bennet
from
fighting.
Tell
him
what
a
dreadful
state
I
am
in,
that
I
am
frighted
out
of
my
wits
and
have
such
tremblings,
such
flutterings,
all
over
me
such
spasms
in
my
side
and
pains
in
my
head,
and
such
beatings
at
heart,
that
I
can
get
no
rest
by
night
nor
by
day.
And
tell
my
dear
Lydia
not
to
give
any
directions
about
her
clothes
till
she
has
seen
me,
for
she
does
not
know
which
are
the
best
warehouses.
Oh,
brother,
how
kind
you
are!
I
know
you
will
contrive
it
all."
But
Mr.
Gardiner,
though
he
assured
her
again
of
his
earnest
endeavours
in
the
cause,
could
not
