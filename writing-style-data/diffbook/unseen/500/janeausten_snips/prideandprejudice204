you
every
thing.
It
is
a
relation
which
you
tell
me
is
to
give
you
great
surprise;
I
hope
at
least
it
will
not
afford
you
any
displeasure.
Lydia
came
to
us;
and
Wickham
had
constant
admission
to
the
house.
He
was
exactly
what
he
had
been,
when
I
knew
him
in
Hertfordshire;
but
I
would
not
tell
you
how
little
I
was
satisfied
with
her
behaviour
while
she
staid
with
us,
if
I
had
not
perceived,
by
Jane's
letter
last
Wednesday,
that
her
conduct
on
coming
home
was
exactly
of
a
piece
with
it,
and
therefore
what
I
now
tell
you
can
give
you
no
fresh
pain.
I
talked
to
her
repeatedly
in
the
most
serious
manner,
representing
to
her
all
the
wickedness
of
what
she
had
done,
and
all
the
unhappiness
she
had
brought
on
her
family.
If
she
heard
me,
it
was
by
good
luck,
for
I
am
sure
she
did
not
listen.
I
was
sometimes
quite
provoked,
but
then
I
recollected
my
dear
Elizabeth
and
Jane,
and
for
their
sakes
had
patience
with
her.
"Mr.
Darcy
was
punctual
in
his
return,
and
as
Lydia
informed
you,
attended
the
wedding.
He
dined
with
us
the
next
day,
and
was
to
leave
town
again
on
Wednesday
or
Thursday.
Will
you
be
very
angry
with
me,
my
dear
Lizzy,
if
I
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
(what
I
was
never
bold
enough
to
say
before)
how
much
I
like
him.
His
behaviour
to
us
has,
in
every
respect,
been
as
pleasing
as
when
we
were
in
Derbyshire.
His
understanding
and
opinions
all
please
me;
he
wants
nothing
but
a
little
more
liveliness,
and
that,
if
he
marry
prudently,
his
wife
may
teach
him.
I
thought
him
very
sly;
he
hardly
ever
mentioned
your
name.
But
slyness
seems
the
fashion.
"Pray
forgive
me
if
I
have
been
very
presuming,
or
at
least
do
not
punish
me
so
far
as
to
exclude
me
from
P.
I
shall
never
be
quite
happy
till
I
have
been
all
round
the
park.
A
low
phaeton,
with
a
nice
little
pair
of
ponies,
would
be
the
very
thing.
"But
I
must
write
no
more.
The
children
have
been
wanting
me
this
half
hour.
"Yours,
very
sincerely,
"M.
GARDINER."
The
contents
of
this
letter
threw
Elizabeth
into
a
flutter
of
spirits,
in
which
it
was
difficult
to
determine
whether
pleasure
or
pain
bore
the
greatest
share.
The
vague
and
unsettled
suspicions
which
uncertainty
had
produced
of
what
Mr.
Darcy
might
have
been
doing
to
forward
her
sister's
match,
which
she
had
feared
to
encourage
as
an
exertion
of
goodness
too
great
to
be
probable,
and
at
the
same
time
dreaded
to
be
just,
from
the
pain
of
obligation,
were
proved
beyond
their
greatest
extent
to
be
true!
He
had
followed
them
purposely
to
town,
he
had
taken
on
himself
all
the
trouble
and
mortification
attendant
on
such
a
research;
in
which
supplication
had
been
necessary
to
a
woman
whom
he
must
abominate
and
despise,
and
where
