whenever
he
thinks
it
worth
his
while;
whenever
there
is
any
temptation
of
pleasure."
"It
is
very
unfair
to
judge
of
any
body's
conduct,
without
an
intimate
knowledge
of
their
situation.
Nobody,
who
has
not
been
in
the
interior
of
a
family,
can
say
what
the
difficulties
of
any
individual
of
that
family
may
be.
We
ought
to
be
acquainted
with
Enscombe,
and
with
Mrs.
Churchill's
temper,
before
we
pretend
to
decide
upon
what
her
nephew
can
do.
He
may,
at
times,
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
more
than
he
can
at
others."
"There
is
one
thing,
Emma,
which
a
man
can
always
do,
if
he
chuses,
and
that
is,
his
duty;
not
by
manoeuvring
and
finessing,
but
by
vigour
and
resolution.
It
is
Frank
Churchill's
duty
to
pay
this
attention
to
his
father.
He
knows
it
to
be
so,
by
his
promises
and
messages;
but
if
he
wished
to
do
it,
it
might
be
done.
A
man
who
felt
rightly
would
say
at
once,
simply
and
resolutely,
to
Mrs.
Churchill
'Every
sacrifice
of
mere
pleasure
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
make
to
your
convenience;
but
I
must
go
and
see
my
father
immediately.
I
know
he
would
be
hurt
by
my
failing
in
such
a
mark
of
respect
to
him
on
the
present
occasion.
I
shall,
therefore,
set
off
to
morrow.'
If
he
would
say
so
to
her
at
once,
in
the
tone
of
decision
becoming
a
man,
there
would
be
no
opposition
made
to
his
going."
"No,"
said
Emma,
laughing;
"but
perhaps
there
might
be
some
made
to
his
coming
back
again.
Such
language
for
a
young
man
entirely
dependent,
to
use!
Nobody
but
you,
Mr.
Knightley,
would
imagine
it
possible.
But
you
have
not
an
idea
of
what
is
requisite
in
situations
directly
opposite
to
your
own.
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
be
making
such
a
speech
as
that
to
the
uncle
and
aunt,
who
have
brought
him
up,
and
are
to
provide
for
him!
Standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
I
suppose,
and
speaking
as
loud
as
he
could!
How
can
you
imagine
such
conduct
practicable?"
"Depend
upon
it,
Emma,
a
sensible
man
would
find
no
difficulty
in
it.
He
would
feel
himself
in
the
right;
and
the
declaration
made,
of
course,
as
a
man
of
sense
would
make
it,
in
a
proper
manner
would
do
him
more
good,
raise
him
higher,
fix
his
interest
stronger
with
the
people
he
depended
on,
than
all
that
a
line
of
shifts
and
expedients
can
ever
do.
Respect
would
be
added
to
affection.
They
would
feel
that
they
could
trust
him;
that
the
nephew
who
had
done
rightly
by
his
father,
would
do
rightly
by
them;
for
they
know,
as
well
as
he
does,
as
well
as
all
the
world
must
know,
that
he
ought
to
pay
this
visit
to
his
father;
and
while
meanly
exerting
their
power
to
delay
it,
are
in
their
hearts
not
thinking
the
better
of
him
for
submitting
to
