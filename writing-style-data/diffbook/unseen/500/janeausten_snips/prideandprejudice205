he
was
reduced
to
meet,
frequently
meet,
reason
with,
persuade,
and
finally
bribe,
the
man
whom
he
always
most
wished
to
avoid,
and
whose
very
name
it
was
punishment
to
him
to
pronounce.
He
had
done
all
this
for
a
girl
whom
he
could
neither
regard
nor
esteem.
Her
heart
did
whisper
that
he
had
done
it
for
her.
But
it
was
a
hope
shortly
checked
by
other
considerations,
and
she
soon
felt
that
even
her
vanity
was
insufficient,
when
required
to
depend
on
his
affection
for
her
for
a
woman
who
had
already
refused
him
as
able
to
overcome
a
sentiment
so
natural
as
abhorrence
against
relationship
with
Wickham.
Brother
in
law
of
Wickham!
Every
kind
of
pride
must
revolt
from
the
connection.
He
had,
to
be
sure,
done
much.
She
was
ashamed
to
think
how
much.
But
he
had
given
a
reason
for
his
interference,
which
asked
no
extraordinary
stretch
of
belief.
It
was
reasonable
that
he
should
feel
he
had
been
wrong;
he
had
liberality,
and
he
had
the
means
of
exercising
it;
and
though
she
would
not
place
herself
as
his
principal
inducement,
she
could,
perhaps,
believe
that
remaining
partiality
for
her
might
assist
his
endeavours
in
a
cause
where
her
peace
of
mind
must
be
materially
concerned.
It
was
painful,
exceedingly
painful,
to
know
that
they
were
under
obligations
to
a
person
who
could
never
receive
a
return.
They
owed
the
restoration
of
Lydia,
her
character,
every
thing,
to
him.
Oh!
how
heartily
did
she
grieve
over
every
ungracious
sensation
she
had
ever
encouraged,
every
saucy
speech
she
had
ever
directed
towards
him.
For
herself
she
was
humbled;
but
she
was
proud
of
him.
Proud
that
in
a
cause
of
compassion
and
honour,
he
had
been
able
to
get
the
better
of
himself.
She
read
over
her
aunt's
commendation
of
him
again
and
again.
It
was
hardly
enough;
but
it
pleased
her.
She
was
even
sensible
of
some
pleasure,
though
mixed
with
regret,
on
finding
how
steadfastly
both
she
and
her
uncle
had
been
persuaded
that
affection
and
confidence
subsisted
between
Mr.
Darcy
and
herself.
She
was
roused
from
her
seat,
and
her
reflections,
by
some
one's
approach;
and
before
she
could
strike
into
another
path,
she
was
overtaken
by
Wickham.
"I
am
afraid
I
interrupt
your
solitary
ramble,
my
dear
sister?"
said
he,
as
he
joined
her.
"You
certainly
do,"
she
replied
with
a
smile;
"but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
interruption
must
be
unwelcome."
"I
should
be
sorry
indeed,
if
it
were.
We
were
always
good
friends;
and
now
we
are
better."
"True.
Are
the
others
coming
out?"
"I
do
not
know.
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Lydia
are
going
in
the
carriage
to
Meryton.
And
so,
my
dear
sister,
I
find,
from
our
uncle
and
aunt,
that
you
have
actually
seen
Pemberley."
She
replied
in
the
affirmative.
"I
almost
envy
you
the
pleasure,
and
yet
I
believe
it
would
be
too
much
for
me,
or
else
I
could
take
it
in
my
way
