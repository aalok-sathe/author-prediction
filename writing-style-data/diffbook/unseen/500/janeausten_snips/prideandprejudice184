of
seduction,
had
been
extended
into
every
tradesman's
family.
Everybody
declared
that
he
was
the
wickedest
young
man
in
the
world;
and
everybody
began
to
find
out
that
they
had
always
distrusted
the
appearance
of
his
goodness.
Elizabeth,
though
she
did
not
credit
above
half
of
what
was
said,
believed
enough
to
make
her
former
assurance
of
her
sister's
ruin
more
certain;
and
even
Jane,
who
believed
still
less
of
it,
became
almost
hopeless,
more
especially
as
the
time
was
now
come
when,
if
they
had
gone
to
Scotland,
which
she
had
never
before
entirely
despaired
of,
they
must
in
all
probability
have
gained
some
news
of
them.
Mr.
Gardiner
left
Longbourn
on
Sunday;
on
Tuesday
his
wife
received
a
letter
from
him;
it
told
them
that,
on
his
arrival,
he
had
immediately
found
out
his
brother,
and
persuaded
him
to
come
to
Gracechurch
Street;
that
Mr.
Bennet
had
been
to
Epsom
and
Clapham,
before
his
arrival,
but
without
gaining
any
satisfactory
information;
and
that
he
was
now
determined
to
inquire
at
all
the
principal
hotels
in
town,
as
Mr.
Bennet
thought
it
possible
they
might
have
gone
to
one
of
them,
on
their
first
coming
to
London,
before
they
procured
lodgings.
Mr.
Gardiner
himself
did
not
expect
any
success
from
this
measure,
but
as
his
brother
was
eager
in
it,
he
meant
to
assist
him
in
pursuing
it.
He
added
that
Mr.
Bennet
seemed
wholly
disinclined
at
present
to
leave
London
and
promised
to
write
again
very
soon.
There
was
also
a
postscript
to
this
effect:
"I
have
written
to
Colonel
Forster
to
desire
him
to
find
out,
if
possible,
from
some
of
the
young
man's
intimates
in
the
regiment,
whether
Wickham
has
any
relations
or
connections
who
would
be
likely
to
know
in
what
part
of
town
he
has
now
concealed
himself.
If
there
were
anyone
that
one
could
apply
to
with
a
probability
of
gaining
such
a
clue
as
that,
it
might
be
of
essential
consequence.
At
present
we
have
nothing
to
guide
us.
Colonel
Forster
will,
I
dare
say,
do
everything
in
his
power
to
satisfy
us
on
this
head.
But,
on
second
thoughts,
perhaps,
Lizzy
could
tell
us
what
relations
he
has
now
living,
better
than
any
other
person."
Elizabeth
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
from
whence
this
deference
to
her
authority
proceeded;
but
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
give
any
information
of
so
satisfactory
a
nature
as
the
compliment
deserved.
She
had
never
heard
of
his
having
had
any
relations,
except
a
father
and
mother,
both
of
whom
had
been
dead
many
years.
It
was
possible,
however,
that
some
of
his
companions
in
the
shire
might
be
able
to
give
more
information;
and
though
she
was
not
very
sanguine
in
expecting
it,
the
application
was
a
something
to
look
forward
to.
Every
day
at
Longbourn
was
now
a
day
of
anxiety;
but
the
most
anxious
part
of
each
was
when
the
post
was
expected.
The
arrival
of
letters
was
the
grand
