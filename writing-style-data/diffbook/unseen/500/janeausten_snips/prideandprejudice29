to
the
imperfection
of
the
performance.
When
you
told
Mrs.
Bennet
this
morning
that
if
you
ever
resolved
upon
quitting
Netherfield
you
should
be
gone
in
five
minutes,
you
meant
it
to
be
a
sort
of
panegyric,
of
compliment
to
yourself
and
yet
what
is
there
so
very
laudable
in
a
precipitance
which
must
leave
very
necessary
business
undone,
and
can
be
of
no
real
advantage
to
yourself
or
anyone
else?"
"Nay,"
cried
Bingley,
"this
is
too
much,
to
remember
at
night
all
the
foolish
things
that
were
said
in
the
morning.
And
yet,
upon
my
honour,
I
believe
what
I
said
of
myself
to
be
true,
and
I
believe
it
at
this
moment.
At
least,
therefore,
I
did
not
assume
the
character
of
needless
precipitance
merely
to
show
off
before
the
ladies."
"I
dare
say
you
believed
it;
but
I
am
by
no
means
convinced
that
you
would
be
gone
with
such
celerity.
Your
conduct
would
be
quite
as
dependent
on
chance
as
that
of
any
man
I
know;
and
if,
as
you
were
mounting
your
horse,
a
friend
were
to
say,
'Bingley,
you
had
better
stay
till
next
week,'
you
would
probably
do
it,
you
would
probably
not
go
and
at
another
word,
might
stay
a
month."
"You
have
only
proved
by
this,"
cried
Elizabeth,
"that
Mr.
Bingley
did
not
do
justice
to
his
own
disposition.
You
have
shown
him
off
now
much
more
than
he
did
himself."
"I
am
exceedingly
gratified,"
said
Bingley,
"by
your
converting
what
my
friend
says
into
a
compliment
on
the
sweetness
of
my
temper.
But
I
am
afraid
you
are
giving
it
a
turn
which
that
gentleman
did
by
no
means
intend;
for
he
would
certainly
think
better
of
me,
if
under
such
a
circumstance
I
were
to
give
a
flat
denial,
and
ride
off
as
fast
as
I
could."
"Would
Mr.
Darcy
then
consider
the
rashness
of
your
original
intentions
as
atoned
for
by
your
obstinacy
in
adhering
to
it?"
"Upon
my
word,
I
cannot
exactly
explain
the
matter;
Darcy
must
speak
for
himself."
"You
expect
me
to
account
for
opinions
which
you
choose
to
call
mine,
but
which
I
have
never
acknowledged.
Allowing
the
case,
however,
to
stand
according
to
your
representation,
you
must
remember,
Miss
Bennet,
that
the
friend
who
is
supposed
to
desire
his
return
to
the
house,
and
the
delay
of
his
plan,
has
merely
desired
it,
asked
it
without
offering
one
argument
in
favour
of
its
propriety."
"To
yield
readily
easily
to
the
persuasion
of
a
friend
is
no
merit
with
you."
"To
yield
without
conviction
is
no
compliment
to
the
understanding
of
either."
"You
appear
to
me,
Mr.
Darcy,
to
allow
nothing
for
the
influence
of
friendship
and
affection.
A
regard
for
the
requester
would
often
make
one
readily
yield
to
a
request,
without
waiting
for
arguments
to
reason
one
into
it.
I
am
not
particularly
speaking
of
such
a
case
as
you
have
supposed
about
Mr.
Bingley.
We
may
as
well
wait,
perhaps,
till
