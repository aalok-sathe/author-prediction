very
moderate,
it
was
not
unfair
to
guess
the
dignity
of
his
line
of
trade
had
been
very
moderate
also.
Part
of
every
winter
she
had
been
used
to
spend
in
Bath;
but
Bristol
was
her
home,
the
very
heart
of
Bristol;
for
though
the
father
and
mother
had
died
some
years
ago,
an
uncle
remained
in
the
law
line
nothing
more
distinctly
honourable
was
hazarded
of
him,
than
that
he
was
in
the
law
line;
and
with
him
the
daughter
had
lived.
Emma
guessed
him
to
be
the
drudge
of
some
attorney,
and
too
stupid
to
rise.
And
all
the
grandeur
of
the
connexion
seemed
dependent
on
the
elder
sister,
who
was
very
well
married,
to
a
gentleman
in
a
great
way,
near
Bristol,
who
kept
two
carriages!
That
was
the
wind
up
of
the
history;
that
was
the
glory
of
Miss
Hawkins.
Could
she
but
have
given
Harriet
her
feelings
about
it
all!
She
had
talked
her
into
love;
but,
alas!
she
was
not
so
easily
to
be
talked
out
of
it.
The
charm
of
an
object
to
occupy
the
many
vacancies
of
Harriet's
mind
was
not
to
be
talked
away.
He
might
be
superseded
by
another;
he
certainly
would
indeed;
nothing
could
be
clearer;
even
a
Robert
Martin
would
have
been
sufficient;
but
nothing
else,
she
feared,
would
cure
her.
Harriet
was
one
of
those,
who,
having
once
begun,
would
be
always
in
love.
And
now,
poor
girl!
she
was
considerably
worse
from
this
reappearance
of
Mr.
Elton.
She
was
always
having
a
glimpse
of
him
somewhere
or
other.
Emma
saw
him
only
once;
but
two
or
three
times
every
day
Harriet
was
sure
just
to
meet
with
him,
or
just
to
miss
him,
just
to
hear
his
voice,
or
see
his
shoulder,
just
to
have
something
occur
to
preserve
him
in
her
fancy,
in
all
the
favouring
warmth
of
surprize
and
conjecture.
She
was,
moreover,
perpetually
hearing
about
him;
for,
excepting
when
at
Hartfield,
she
was
always
among
those
who
saw
no
fault
in
Mr.
Elton,
and
found
nothing
so
interesting
as
the
discussion
of
his
concerns;
and
every
report,
therefore,
every
guess
all
that
had
already
occurred,
all
that
might
occur
in
the
arrangement
of
his
affairs,
comprehending
income,
servants,
and
furniture,
was
continually
in
agitation
around
her.
Her
regard
was
receiving
strength
by
invariable
praise
of
him,
and
her
regrets
kept
alive,
and
feelings
irritated
by
ceaseless
repetitions
of
Miss
Hawkins's
happiness,
and
continual
observation
of,
how
much
he
seemed
attached!
his
air
as
he
walked
by
the
house
the
very
sitting
of
his
hat,
being
all
in
proof
of
how
much
he
was
in
love!
Had
it
been
allowable
entertainment,
had
there
been
no
pain
to
her
friend,
or
reproach
to
herself,
in
the
waverings
of
Harriet's
mind,
Emma
would
have
been
amused
by
its
variations.
Sometimes
Mr.
Elton
predominated,
sometimes
the
Martins;
and
each
was
occasionally
useful
as
a
check
to
the
other.
Mr.
Elton's
engagement
had
been
the
cure
of
the
