acted.
Regard
for
my
sister's
credit
and
feelings
prevented
any
public
exposure;
but
I
wrote
to
Mr.
Wickham,
who
left
the
place
immediately,
and
Mrs.
Younge
was
of
course
removed
from
her
charge.
Mr.
Wickham's
chief
object
was
unquestionably
my
sister's
fortune,
which
is
thirty
thousand
pounds;
but
I
cannot
help
supposing
that
the
hope
of
revenging
himself
on
me
was
a
strong
inducement.
His
revenge
would
have
been
complete
indeed.
"This,
madam,
is
a
faithful
narrative
of
every
event
in
which
we
have
been
concerned
together;
and
if
you
do
not
absolutely
reject
it
as
false,
you
will,
I
hope,
acquit
me
henceforth
of
cruelty
towards
Mr.
Wickham.
I
know
not
in
what
manner,
under
what
form
of
falsehood
he
had
imposed
on
you;
but
his
success
is
not
perhaps
to
be
wondered
at.
Ignorant
as
you
previously
were
of
everything
concerning
either,
detection
could
not
be
in
your
power,
and
suspicion
certainly
not
in
your
inclination.
"You
may
possibly
wonder
why
all
this
was
not
told
you
last
night;
but
I
was
not
then
master
enough
of
myself
to
know
what
could
or
ought
to
be
revealed.
For
the
truth
of
everything
here
related,
I
can
appeal
more
particularly
to
the
testimony
of
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
who,
from
our
near
relationship
and
constant
intimacy,
and,
still
more,
as
one
of
the
executors
of
my
father's
will,
has
been
unavoidably
acquainted
with
every
particular
of
these
transactions.
If
your
abhorrence
of
me
should
make
my
assertions
valueless,
you
cannot
be
prevented
by
the
same
cause
from
confiding
in
my
cousin;
and
that
there
may
be
the
possibility
of
consulting
him,
I
shall
endeavour
to
find
some
opportunity
of
putting
this
letter
in
your
hands
in
the
course
of
the
morning.
I
will
only
add,
God
bless
you.
"FITZWILLIAM
DARCY"
If
Elizabeth,
when
Mr.
Darcy
gave
her
the
letter,
did
not
expect
it
to
contain
a
renewal
of
his
offers,
she
had
formed
no
expectation
at
all
of
its
contents.
But
such
as
they
were,
it
may
well
be
supposed
how
eagerly
she
went
through
them,
and
what
a
contrariety
of
emotion
they
excited.
Her
feelings
as
she
read
were
scarcely
to
be
defined.
With
amazement
did
she
first
understand
that
he
believed
any
apology
to
be
in
his
power;
and
steadfastly
was
she
persuaded,
that
he
could
have
no
explanation
to
give,
which
a
just
sense
of
shame
would
not
conceal.
With
a
strong
prejudice
against
everything
he
might
say,
she
began
his
account
of
what
had
happened
at
Netherfield.
She
read
with
an
eagerness
which
hardly
left
her
power
of
comprehension,
and
from
impatience
of
knowing
what
the
next
sentence
might
bring,
was
incapable
of
attending
to
the
sense
of
the
one
before
her
eyes.
His
belief
of
her
sister's
insensibility
she
instantly
resolved
to
be
false;
and
his
account
of
the
real,
the
worst
objections
to
the
match,
made
her
too
angry
to
have
any
wish
of
doing
him
justice.
He
expressed
no
regret
for
what
he
had
