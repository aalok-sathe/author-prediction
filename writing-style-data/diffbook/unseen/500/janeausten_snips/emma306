degree
as
to
I
have
not
time
for
half
that
I
could
wish
to
say.
I
long
to
make
apologies,
excuses,
to
urge
something
for
myself.
I
feel
it
so
very
due.
But,
unfortunately
in
short,
if
your
compassion
does
not
stand
my
friend
"
"Oh!
you
are
too
scrupulous,
indeed
you
are,"
cried
Emma
warmly,
and
taking
her
hand.
"You
owe
me
no
apologies;
and
every
body
to
whom
you
might
be
supposed
to
owe
them,
is
so
perfectly
satisfied,
so
delighted
even
"
"You
are
very
kind,
but
I
know
what
my
manners
were
to
you.
So
cold
and
artificial!
I
had
always
a
part
to
act.
It
was
a
life
of
deceit!
I
know
that
I
must
have
disgusted
you."
"Pray
say
no
more.
I
feel
that
all
the
apologies
should
be
on
my
side.
Let
us
forgive
each
other
at
once.
We
must
do
whatever
is
to
be
done
quickest,
and
I
think
our
feelings
will
lose
no
time
there.
I
hope
you
have
pleasant
accounts
from
Windsor?"
"Very."
"And
the
next
news,
I
suppose,
will
be,
that
we
are
to
lose
you
just
as
I
begin
to
know
you."
"Oh!
as
to
all
that,
of
course
nothing
can
be
thought
of
yet.
I
am
here
till
claimed
by
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell."
"Nothing
can
be
actually
settled
yet,
perhaps,"
replied
Emma,
smiling
"but,
excuse
me,
it
must
be
thought
of."
The
smile
was
returned
as
Jane
answered,
"You
are
very
right;
it
has
been
thought
of.
And
I
will
own
to
you,
(I
am
sure
it
will
be
safe),
that
so
far
as
our
living
with
Mr.
Churchill
at
Enscombe,
it
is
settled.
There
must
be
three
months,
at
least,
of
deep
mourning;
but
when
they
are
over,
I
imagine
there
will
be
nothing
more
to
wait
for."
"Thank
you,
thank
you.
This
is
just
what
I
wanted
to
be
assured
of.
Oh!
if
you
knew
how
much
I
love
every
thing
that
is
decided
and
open!
Good
bye,
good
bye."
Mrs.
Weston's
friends
were
all
made
happy
by
her
safety;
and
if
the
satisfaction
of
her
well
doing
could
be
increased
to
Emma,
it
was
by
knowing
her
to
be
the
mother
of
a
little
girl.
She
had
been
decided
in
wishing
for
a
Miss
Weston.
She
would
not
acknowledge
that
it
was
with
any
view
of
making
a
match
for
her,
hereafter,
with
either
of
Isabella's
sons;
but
she
was
convinced
that
a
daughter
would
suit
both
father
and
mother
best.
It
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
Mr.
Weston,
as
he
grew
older
and
even
Mr.
Weston
might
be
growing
older
ten
years
hence
to
have
his
fireside
enlivened
by
the
sports
and
the
nonsense,
the
freaks
and
the
fancies
of
a
child
never
banished
from
home;
and
Mrs.
Weston
no
one
could
doubt
that
a
daughter
would
be
most
to
her;
and
it
would
be
quite
a
pity
that
any
one
who
so
well
knew
how
to
teach,
should
not
have
