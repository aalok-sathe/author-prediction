Darcy
is
not
in
the
least
to
blame,
that
he
cannot
bear
to
hear
George
Wickham
mentioned,
and
that
though
my
brother
thought
that
he
could
not
well
avoid
including
him
in
his
invitation
to
the
officers,
he
was
excessively
glad
to
find
that
he
had
taken
himself
out
of
the
way.
His
coming
into
the
country
at
all
is
a
most
insolent
thing,
indeed,
and
I
wonder
how
he
could
presume
to
do
it.
I
pity
you,
Miss
Eliza,
for
this
discovery
of
your
favourite's
guilt;
but
really,
considering
his
descent,
one
could
not
expect
much
better."
"His
guilt
and
his
descent
appear
by
your
account
to
be
the
same,"
said
Elizabeth
angrily;
"for
I
have
heard
you
accuse
him
of
nothing
worse
than
of
being
the
son
of
Mr.
Darcy's
steward,
and
of
that,
I
can
assure
you,
he
informed
me
himself."
"I
beg
your
pardon,"
replied
Miss
Bingley,
turning
away
with
a
sneer.
"Excuse
my
interference
it
was
kindly
meant."
"Insolent
girl!"
said
Elizabeth
to
herself.
"You
are
much
mistaken
if
you
expect
to
influence
me
by
such
a
paltry
attack
as
this.
I
see
nothing
in
it
but
your
own
wilful
ignorance
and
the
malice
of
Mr.
Darcy."
She
then
sought
her
eldest
sister,
who
had
undertaken
to
make
inquiries
on
the
same
subject
of
Bingley.
Jane
met
her
with
a
smile
of
such
sweet
complacency,
a
glow
of
such
happy
expression,
as
sufficiently
marked
how
well
she
was
satisfied
with
the
occurrences
of
the
evening.
Elizabeth
instantly
read
her
feelings,
and
at
that
moment
solicitude
for
Wickham,
resentment
against
his
enemies,
and
everything
else,
gave
way
before
the
hope
of
Jane's
being
in
the
fairest
way
for
happiness.
"I
want
to
know,"
said
she,
with
a
countenance
no
less
smiling
than
her
sister's,
"what
you
have
learnt
about
Mr.
Wickham.
But
perhaps
you
have
been
too
pleasantly
engaged
to
think
of
any
third
person;
in
which
case
you
may
be
sure
of
my
pardon."
"No,"
replied
Jane,
"I
have
not
forgotten
him;
but
I
have
nothing
satisfactory
to
tell
you.
Mr.
Bingley
does
not
know
the
whole
of
his
history,
and
is
quite
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
which
have
principally
offended
Mr.
Darcy;
but
he
will
vouch
for
the
good
conduct,
the
probity,
and
honour
of
his
friend,
and
is
perfectly
convinced
that
Mr.
Wickham
has
deserved
much
less
attention
from
Mr.
Darcy
than
he
has
received;
and
I
am
sorry
to
say
by
his
account
as
well
as
his
sister's,
Mr.
Wickham
is
by
no
means
a
respectable
young
man.
I
am
afraid
he
has
been
very
imprudent,
and
has
deserved
to
lose
Mr.
Darcy's
regard."
"Mr.
Bingley
does
not
know
Mr.
Wickham
himself?"
"No;
he
never
saw
him
till
the
other
morning
at
Meryton."
"This
account
then
is
what
he
has
received
from
Mr.
Darcy.
I
am
satisfied.
But
what
does
he
say
of
the
living?"
"He
does
not
exactly
recollect
the
circumstances,
though
he
has
heard
them
from
Mr.
Darcy
more
than
