own
wishes;
and
never
had
she
so
honestly
felt
that
she
could
have
loved
him,
as
now,
when
all
love
must
be
vain.
But
self,
though
it
would
intrude,
could
not
engross
her.
Lydia
the
humiliation,
the
misery
she
was
bringing
on
them
all,
soon
swallowed
up
every
private
care;
and
covering
her
face
with
her
handkerchief,
Elizabeth
was
soon
lost
to
everything
else;
and,
after
a
pause
of
several
minutes,
was
only
recalled
to
a
sense
of
her
situation
by
the
voice
of
her
companion,
who,
in
a
manner
which,
though
it
spoke
compassion,
spoke
likewise
restraint,
said,
"I
am
afraid
you
have
been
long
desiring
my
absence,
nor
have
I
anything
to
plead
in
excuse
of
my
stay,
but
real,
though
unavailing
concern.
Would
to
Heaven
that
anything
could
be
either
said
or
done
on
my
part
that
might
offer
consolation
to
such
distress!
But
I
will
not
torment
you
with
vain
wishes,
which
may
seem
purposely
to
ask
for
your
thanks.
This
unfortunate
affair
will,
I
fear,
prevent
my
sister's
having
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
Pemberley
to
day."
"Oh,
yes.
Be
so
kind
as
to
apologise
for
us
to
Miss
Darcy.
Say
that
urgent
business
calls
us
home
immediately.
Conceal
the
unhappy
truth
as
long
as
it
is
possible,
I
know
it
cannot
be
long."
He
readily
assured
her
of
his
secrecy;
again
expressed
his
sorrow
for
her
distress,
wished
it
a
happier
conclusion
than
there
was
at
present
reason
to
hope,
and
leaving
his
compliments
for
her
relations,
with
only
one
serious,
parting
look,
went
away.
As
he
quitted
the
room,
Elizabeth
felt
how
improbable
it
was
that
they
should
ever
see
each
other
again
on
such
terms
of
cordiality
as
had
marked
their
several
meetings
in
Derbyshire;
and
as
she
threw
a
retrospective
glance
over
the
whole
of
their
acquaintance,
so
full
of
contradictions
and
varieties,
sighed
at
the
perverseness
of
those
feelings
which
would
now
have
promoted
its
continuance,
and
would
formerly
have
rejoiced
in
its
termination.
If
gratitude
and
esteem
are
good
foundations
of
affection,
Elizabeth's
change
of
sentiment
will
be
neither
improbable
nor
faulty.
But
if
otherwise
if
regard
springing
from
such
sources
is
unreasonable
or
unnatural,
in
comparison
of
what
is
so
often
described
as
arising
on
a
first
interview
with
its
object,
and
even
before
two
words
have
been
exchanged,
nothing
can
be
said
in
her
defence,
except
that
she
had
given
somewhat
of
a
trial
to
the
latter
method
in
her
partiality
for
Wickham,
and
that
its
ill
success
might,
perhaps,
authorise
her
to
seek
the
other
less
interesting
mode
of
attachment.
Be
that
as
it
may,
she
saw
him
go
with
regret;
and
in
this
early
example
of
what
Lydia's
infamy
must
produce,
found
additional
anguish
as
she
reflected
on
that
wretched
business.
Never,
since
reading
Jane's
second
letter,
had
she
entertained
a
hope
of
Wickham's
meaning
to
marry
her.
No
one
but
Jane,
she
thought,
could
flatter
herself
with
such
an
expectation.
Surprise
was
the
