live
to
see
her
take
her
place
in
it!"
"My
dear,
do
not
give
way
to
such
gloomy
thoughts.
Let
us
hope
for
better
things.
Let
us
flatter
ourselves
that
I
may
be
the
survivor."
This
was
not
very
consoling
to
Mrs.
Bennet,
and
therefore,
instead
of
making
any
answer,
she
went
on
as
before.
"I
cannot
bear
to
think
that
they
should
have
all
this
estate.
If
it
was
not
for
the
entail,
I
should
not
mind
it."
"What
should
not
you
mind?"
"I
should
not
mind
anything
at
all."
"Let
us
be
thankful
that
you
are
preserved
from
a
state
of
such
insensibility."
"I
never
can
be
thankful,
Mr.
Bennet,
for
anything
about
the
entail.
How
anyone
could
have
the
conscience
to
entail
away
an
estate
from
one's
own
daughters,
I
cannot
understand;
and
all
for
the
sake
of
Mr.
Collins
too!
Why
should
he
have
it
more
than
anybody
else?"
"I
leave
it
to
yourself
to
determine,"
said
Mr.
Bennet.
Miss
Bingley's
letter
arrived,
and
put
an
end
to
doubt.
The
very
first
sentence
conveyed
the
assurance
of
their
being
all
settled
in
London
for
the
winter,
and
concluded
with
her
brother's
regret
at
not
having
had
time
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
friends
in
Hertfordshire
before
he
left
the
country.
Hope
was
over,
entirely
over;
and
when
Jane
could
attend
to
the
rest
of
the
letter,
she
found
little,
except
the
professed
affection
of
the
writer,
that
could
give
her
any
comfort.
Miss
Darcy's
praise
occupied
the
chief
of
it.
Her
many
attractions
were
again
dwelt
on,
and
Caroline
boasted
joyfully
of
their
increasing
intimacy,
and
ventured
to
predict
the
accomplishment
of
the
wishes
which
had
been
unfolded
in
her
former
letter.
She
wrote
also
with
great
pleasure
of
her
brother's
being
an
inmate
of
Mr.
Darcy's
house,
and
mentioned
with
raptures
some
plans
of
the
latter
with
regard
to
new
furniture.
Elizabeth,
to
whom
Jane
very
soon
communicated
the
chief
of
all
this,
heard
it
in
silent
indignation.
Her
heart
was
divided
between
concern
for
her
sister,
and
resentment
against
all
others.
To
Caroline's
assertion
of
her
brother's
being
partial
to
Miss
Darcy
she
paid
no
credit.
That
he
was
really
fond
of
Jane,
she
doubted
no
more
than
she
had
ever
done;
and
much
as
she
had
always
been
disposed
to
like
him,
she
could
not
think
without
anger,
hardly
without
contempt,
on
that
easiness
of
temper,
that
want
of
proper
resolution,
which
now
made
him
the
slave
of
his
designing
friends,
and
led
him
to
sacrifice
of
his
own
happiness
to
the
caprice
of
their
inclination.
Had
his
own
happiness,
however,
been
the
only
sacrifice,
he
might
have
been
allowed
to
sport
with
it
in
whatever
manner
he
thought
best,
but
her
sister's
was
involved
in
it,
as
she
thought
he
must
be
sensible
himself.
It
was
a
subject,
in
short,
on
which
reflection
would
be
long
indulged,
and
must
be
unavailing.
She
could
think
of
nothing
else;
and
yet
whether
