He
wanted
her
to
look
up
and
smile;
and
having
now
brought
herself
not
to
smile
too
broadly
she
did
cheerfully
answering,
"You
need
not
be
at
any
pains
to
reconcile
me
to
the
match.
I
think
Harriet
is
doing
extremely
well.
Her
connexions
may
be
worse
than
his.
In
respectability
of
character,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
are.
I
have
been
silent
from
surprize
merely,
excessive
surprize.
You
cannot
imagine
how
suddenly
it
has
come
on
me!
how
peculiarly
unprepared
I
was!
for
I
had
reason
to
believe
her
very
lately
more
determined
against
him,
much
more,
than
she
was
before."
"You
ought
to
know
your
friend
best,"
replied
Mr.
Knightley;
"but
I
should
say
she
was
a
good
tempered,
soft
hearted
girl,
not
likely
to
be
very,
very
determined
against
any
young
man
who
told
her
he
loved
her."
Emma
could
not
help
laughing
as
she
answered,
"Upon
my
word,
I
believe
you
know
her
quite
as
well
as
I
do.
But,
Mr.
Knightley,
are
you
perfectly
sure
that
she
has
absolutely
and
downright
accepted
him.
I
could
suppose
she
might
in
time
but
can
she
already?
Did
not
you
misunderstand
him?
You
were
both
talking
of
other
things;
of
business,
shows
of
cattle,
or
new
drills
and
might
not
you,
in
the
confusion
of
so
many
subjects,
mistake
him?
It
was
not
Harriet's
hand
that
he
was
certain
of
it
was
the
dimensions
of
some
famous
ox."
The
contrast
between
the
countenance
and
air
of
Mr.
Knightley
and
Robert
Martin
was,
at
this
moment,
so
strong
to
Emma's
feelings,
and
so
strong
was
the
recollection
of
all
that
had
so
recently
passed
on
Harriet's
side,
so
fresh
the
sound
of
those
words,
spoken
with
such
emphasis,
"No,
I
hope
I
know
better
than
to
think
of
Robert
Martin,"
that
she
was
really
expecting
the
intelligence
to
prove,
in
some
measure,
premature.
It
could
not
be
otherwise.
"Do
you
dare
say
this?"
cried
Mr.
Knightley.
"Do
you
dare
to
suppose
me
so
great
a
blockhead,
as
not
to
know
what
a
man
is
talking
of?
What
do
you
deserve?"
"Oh!
I
always
deserve
the
best
treatment,
because
I
never
put
up
with
any
other;
and,
therefore,
you
must
give
me
a
plain,
direct
answer.
Are
you
quite
sure
that
you
understand
the
terms
on
which
Mr.
Martin
and
Harriet
now
are?"
"I
am
quite
sure,"
he
replied,
speaking
very
distinctly,
"that
he
told
me
she
had
accepted
him;
and
that
there
was
no
obscurity,
nothing
doubtful,
in
the
words
he
used;
and
I
think
I
can
give
you
a
proof
that
it
must
be
so.
He
asked
my
opinion
as
to
what
he
was
now
to
do.
He
knew
of
no
one
but
Mrs.
Goddard
to
whom
he
could
apply
for
information
of
her
relations
or
friends.
Could
I
mention
any
thing
more
fit
to
be
done,
than
to
go
to
Mrs.
Goddard?
I
assured
him
that
I
could
not.
Then,
he
said,
he
would
endeavour
