more,
he
replied,
"If
you
mean
Miss
Fairfax
and
Frank
Churchill,
I
have
heard
that
already."
"How
is
it
possible?"
cried
Emma,
turning
her
glowing
cheeks
towards
him;
for,
while
she
spoke,
it
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
have
called
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
in
his
way.
"I
had
a
few
lines
on
parish
business
from
Mr.
Weston
this
morning,
and
at
the
end
of
them
he
gave
me
a
brief
account
of
what
had
happened."
Emma
was
quite
relieved,
and
could
presently
say,
with
a
little
more
composure,
"You
probably
have
been
less
surprized
than
any
of
us,
for
you
have
had
your
suspicions.
I
have
not
forgotten
that
you
once
tried
to
give
me
a
caution.
I
wish
I
had
attended
to
it
but
(with
a
sinking
voice
and
a
heavy
sigh)
I
seem
to
have
been
doomed
to
blindness."
For
a
moment
or
two
nothing
was
said,
and
she
was
unsuspicious
of
having
excited
any
particular
interest,
till
she
found
her
arm
drawn
within
his,
and
pressed
against
his
heart,
and
heard
him
thus
saying,
in
a
tone
of
great
sensibility,
speaking
low,
"Time,
my
dearest
Emma,
time
will
heal
the
wound.
Your
own
excellent
sense
your
exertions
for
your
father's
sake
I
know
you
will
not
allow
yourself
."
Her
arm
was
pressed
again,
as
he
added,
in
a
more
broken
and
subdued
accent,
"The
feelings
of
the
warmest
friendship
Indignation
Abominable
scoundrel!"
And
in
a
louder,
steadier
tone,
he
concluded
with,
"He
will
soon
be
gone.
They
will
soon
be
in
Yorkshire.
I
am
sorry
for
her.
She
deserves
a
better
fate."
Emma
understood
him;
and
as
soon
as
she
could
recover
from
the
flutter
of
pleasure,
excited
by
such
tender
consideration,
replied,
"You
are
very
kind
but
you
are
mistaken
and
I
must
set
you
right.
I
am
not
in
want
of
that
sort
of
compassion.
My
blindness
to
what
was
going
on,
led
me
to
act
by
them
in
a
way
that
I
must
always
be
ashamed
of,
and
I
was
very
foolishly
tempted
to
say
and
do
many
things
which
may
well
lay
me
open
to
unpleasant
conjectures,
but
I
have
no
other
reason
to
regret
that
I
was
not
in
the
secret
earlier."
"Emma!"
cried
he,
looking
eagerly
at
her,
"are
you,
indeed?"
but
checking
himself
"No,
no,
I
understand
you
forgive
me
I
am
pleased
that
you
can
say
even
so
much.
He
is
no
object
of
regret,
indeed!
and
it
will
not
be
very
long,
I
hope,
before
that
becomes
the
acknowledgment
of
more
than
your
reason.
Fortunate
that
your
affections
were
not
farther
entangled!
I
could
never,
I
confess,
from
your
manners,
assure
myself
as
to
the
degree
of
what
you
felt
I
could
only
be
certain
that
there
was
a
preference
and
a
preference
which
I
never
believed
him
to
deserve.
He
is
a
disgrace
to
the
name
of
man.
And
is
he
to
be
rewarded
with
that
sweet
young
woman?
Jane,
Jane,
you
will
be
