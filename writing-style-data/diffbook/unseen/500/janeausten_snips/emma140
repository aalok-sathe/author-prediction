pleased
to
see
that
it
was
Mr.
Knightley's;
for
Mr.
Knightley
keeping
no
horses,
having
little
spare
money
and
a
great
deal
of
health,
activity,
and
independence,
was
too
apt,
in
Emma's
opinion,
to
get
about
as
he
could,
and
not
use
his
carriage
so
often
as
became
the
owner
of
Donwell
Abbey.
She
had
an
opportunity
now
of
speaking
her
approbation
while
warm
from
her
heart,
for
he
stopped
to
hand
her
out.
"This
is
coming
as
you
should
do,"
said
she;
"like
a
gentleman.
I
am
quite
glad
to
see
you."
He
thanked
her,
observing,
"How
lucky
that
we
should
arrive
at
the
same
moment!
for,
if
we
had
met
first
in
the
drawing
room,
I
doubt
whether
you
would
have
discerned
me
to
be
more
of
a
gentleman
than
usual.
You
might
not
have
distinguished
how
I
came,
by
my
look
or
manner."
"Yes
I
should,
I
am
sure
I
should.
There
is
always
a
look
of
consciousness
or
bustle
when
people
come
in
a
way
which
they
know
to
be
beneath
them.
You
think
you
carry
it
off
very
well,
I
dare
say,
but
with
you
it
is
a
sort
of
bravado,
an
air
of
affected
unconcern;
I
always
observe
it
whenever
I
meet
you
under
those
circumstances.
Now
you
have
nothing
to
try
for.
You
are
not
afraid
of
being
supposed
ashamed.
You
are
not
striving
to
look
taller
than
any
body
else.
Now
I
shall
really
be
very
happy
to
walk
into
the
same
room
with
you."
"Nonsensical
girl!"
was
his
reply,
but
not
at
all
in
anger.
Emma
had
as
much
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
rest
of
the
party
as
with
Mr.
Knightley.
She
was
received
with
a
cordial
respect
which
could
not
but
please,
and
given
all
the
consequence
she
could
wish
for.
When
the
Westons
arrived,
the
kindest
looks
of
love,
the
strongest
of
admiration
were
for
her,
from
both
husband
and
wife;
the
son
approached
her
with
a
cheerful
eagerness
which
marked
her
as
his
peculiar
object,
and
at
dinner
she
found
him
seated
by
her
and,
as
she
firmly
believed,
not
without
some
dexterity
on
his
side.
The
party
was
rather
large,
as
it
included
one
other
family,
a
proper
unobjectionable
country
family,
whom
the
Coles
had
the
advantage
of
naming
among
their
acquaintance,
and
the
male
part
of
Mr.
Cox's
family,
the
lawyer
of
Highbury.
The
less
worthy
females
were
to
come
in
the
evening,
with
Miss
Bates,
Miss
Fairfax,
and
Miss
Smith;
but
already,
at
dinner,
they
were
too
numerous
for
any
subject
of
conversation
to
be
general;
and,
while
politics
and
Mr.
Elton
were
talked
over,
Emma
could
fairly
surrender
all
her
attention
to
the
pleasantness
of
her
neighbour.
The
first
remote
sound
to
which
she
felt
herself
obliged
to
attend,
was
the
name
of
Jane
Fairfax.
Mrs.
Cole
seemed
to
be
relating
something
of
her
that
was
expected
to
be
very
interesting.
She
listened,
and
found
it
well
worth
listening
to.
That
very
