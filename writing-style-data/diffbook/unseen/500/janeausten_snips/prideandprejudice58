oh!
no.
I
am
sure
we
never
read
the
same,
or
not
with
the
same
feelings."
"I
am
sorry
you
think
so;
but
if
that
be
the
case,
there
can
at
least
be
no
want
of
subject.
We
may
compare
our
different
opinions."
"No
I
cannot
talk
of
books
in
a
ball
room;
my
head
is
always
full
of
something
else."
"The
present
always
occupies
you
in
such
scenes
does
it?"
said
he,
with
a
look
of
doubt.
"Yes,
always,"
she
replied,
without
knowing
what
she
said,
for
her
thoughts
had
wandered
far
from
the
subject,
as
soon
afterwards
appeared
by
her
suddenly
exclaiming,
"I
remember
hearing
you
once
say,
Mr.
Darcy,
that
you
hardly
ever
forgave,
that
your
resentment
once
created
was
unappeasable.
You
are
very
cautious,
I
suppose,
as
to
its
being
created."
"I
am,"
said
he,
with
a
firm
voice.
"And
never
allow
yourself
to
be
blinded
by
prejudice?"
"I
hope
not."
"It
is
particularly
incumbent
on
those
who
never
change
their
opinion,
to
be
secure
of
judging
properly
at
first."
"May
I
ask
to
what
these
questions
tend?"
"Merely
to
the
illustration
of
your
character,"
said
she,
endeavouring
to
shake
off
her
gravity.
"I
am
trying
to
make
it
out."
"And
what
is
your
success?"
She
shook
her
head.
"I
do
not
get
on
at
all.
I
hear
such
different
accounts
of
you
as
puzzle
me
exceedingly."
"I
can
readily
believe,"
answered
he
gravely,
"that
reports
may
vary
greatly
with
respect
to
me;
and
I
could
wish,
Miss
Bennet,
that
you
were
not
to
sketch
my
character
at
the
present
moment,
as
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
the
performance
would
reflect
no
credit
on
either."
"But
if
I
do
not
take
your
likeness
now,
I
may
never
have
another
opportunity."
"I
would
by
no
means
suspend
any
pleasure
of
yours,"
he
coldly
replied.
She
said
no
more,
and
they
went
down
the
other
dance
and
parted
in
silence;
and
on
each
side
dissatisfied,
though
not
to
an
equal
degree,
for
in
Darcy's
breast
there
was
a
tolerably
powerful
feeling
towards
her,
which
soon
procured
her
pardon,
and
directed
all
his
anger
against
another.
They
had
not
long
separated,
when
Miss
Bingley
came
towards
her,
and
with
an
expression
of
civil
disdain
accosted
her:
"So,
Miss
Eliza,
I
hear
you
are
quite
delighted
with
George
Wickham!
Your
sister
has
been
talking
to
me
about
him,
and
asking
me
a
thousand
questions;
and
I
find
that
the
young
man
quite
forgot
to
tell
you,
among
his
other
communication,
that
he
was
the
son
of
old
Wickham,
the
late
Mr.
Darcy's
steward.
Let
me
recommend
you,
however,
as
a
friend,
not
to
give
implicit
confidence
to
all
his
assertions;
for
as
to
Mr.
Darcy's
using
him
ill,
it
is
perfectly
false;
for,
on
the
contrary,
he
has
always
been
remarkably
kind
to
him,
though
George
Wickham
has
treated
Mr.
Darcy
in
a
most
infamous
manner.
I
do
not
know
the
particulars,
but
I
know
very
well
that
Mr.
