not
you
feel
that
you
had?
Yes,
I
am
sure
you
are
much
too
reasonable.
You
look
as
if
you
would
not
do
such
a
thing
again."
"Oh!
she
shall
not
do
such
a
thing
again,"
eagerly
rejoined
Mrs.
Elton.
"We
will
not
allow
her
to
do
such
a
thing
again:"
and
nodding
significantly
"there
must
be
some
arrangement
made,
there
must
indeed.
I
shall
speak
to
Mr.
E.
The
man
who
fetches
our
letters
every
morning
(one
of
our
men,
I
forget
his
name)
shall
inquire
for
yours
too
and
bring
them
to
you.
That
will
obviate
all
difficulties
you
know;
and
from
us
I
really
think,
my
dear
Jane,
you
can
have
no
scruple
to
accept
such
an
accommodation."
"You
are
extremely
kind,"
said
Jane;
"but
I
cannot
give
up
my
early
walk.
I
am
advised
to
be
out
of
doors
as
much
as
I
can,
I
must
walk
somewhere,
and
the
post
office
is
an
object;
and
upon
my
word,
I
have
scarcely
ever
had
a
bad
morning
before."
"My
dear
Jane,
say
no
more
about
it.
The
thing
is
determined,
that
is
(laughing
affectedly)
as
far
as
I
can
presume
to
determine
any
thing
without
the
concurrence
of
my
lord
and
master.
You
know,
Mrs.
Weston,
you
and
I
must
be
cautious
how
we
express
ourselves.
But
I
do
flatter
myself,
my
dear
Jane,
that
my
influence
is
not
entirely
worn
out.
If
I
meet
with
no
insuperable
difficulties
therefore,
consider
that
point
as
settled."
"Excuse
me,"
said
Jane
earnestly,
"I
cannot
by
any
means
consent
to
such
an
arrangement,
so
needlessly
troublesome
to
your
servant.
If
the
errand
were
not
a
pleasure
to
me,
it
could
be
done,
as
it
always
is
when
I
am
not
here,
by
my
grandmama's."
"Oh!
my
dear;
but
so
much
as
Patty
has
to
do!
And
it
is
a
kindness
to
employ
our
men."
Jane
looked
as
if
she
did
not
mean
to
be
conquered;
but
instead
of
answering,
she
began
speaking
again
to
Mr.
John
Knightley.
"The
post
office
is
a
wonderful
establishment!"
said
she.
"The
regularity
and
despatch
of
it!
If
one
thinks
of
all
that
it
has
to
do,
and
all
that
it
does
so
well,
it
is
really
astonishing!"
"It
is
certainly
very
well
regulated."
"So
seldom
that
any
negligence
or
blunder
appears!
So
seldom
that
a
letter,
among
the
thousands
that
are
constantly
passing
about
the
kingdom,
is
even
carried
wrong
and
not
one
in
a
million,
I
suppose,
actually
lost!
And
when
one
considers
the
variety
of
hands,
and
of
bad
hands
too,
that
are
to
be
deciphered,
it
increases
the
wonder."
"The
clerks
grow
expert
from
habit.
They
must
begin
with
some
quickness
of
sight
and
hand,
and
exercise
improves
them.
If
you
want
any
farther
explanation,"
continued
he,
smiling,
"they
are
paid
for
it.
That
is
the
key
to
a
great
deal
of
capacity.
The
public
pays
and
must
be
served
well."
The
varieties
of
handwriting
were
farther
talked
of,
and
