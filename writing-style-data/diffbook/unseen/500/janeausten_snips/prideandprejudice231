moment
more
valuable.
They
walked
on,
without
knowing
in
what
direction.
There
was
too
much
to
be
thought,
and
felt,
and
said,
for
attention
to
any
other
objects.
She
soon
learnt
that
they
were
indebted
for
their
present
good
understanding
to
the
efforts
of
his
aunt,
who
did
call
on
him
in
her
return
through
London,
and
there
relate
her
journey
to
Longbourn,
its
motive,
and
the
substance
of
her
conversation
with
Elizabeth;
dwelling
emphatically
on
every
expression
of
the
latter
which,
in
her
ladyship's
apprehension,
peculiarly
denoted
her
perverseness
and
assurance;
in
the
belief
that
such
a
relation
must
assist
her
endeavours
to
obtain
that
promise
from
her
nephew
which
she
had
refused
to
give.
But,
unluckily
for
her
ladyship,
its
effect
had
been
exactly
contrariwise.
"It
taught
me
to
hope,"
said
he,
"as
I
had
scarcely
ever
allowed
myself
to
hope
before.
I
knew
enough
of
your
disposition
to
be
certain
that,
had
you
been
absolutely,
irrevocably
decided
against
me,
you
would
have
acknowledged
it
to
Lady
Catherine,
frankly
and
openly."
Elizabeth
coloured
and
laughed
as
she
replied,
"Yes,
you
know
enough
of
my
frankness
to
believe
me
capable
of
that.
After
abusing
you
so
abominably
to
your
face,
I
could
have
no
scruple
in
abusing
you
to
all
your
relations."
"What
did
you
say
of
me,
that
I
did
not
deserve?
For,
though
your
accusations
were
ill
founded,
formed
on
mistaken
premises,
my
behaviour
to
you
at
the
time
had
merited
the
severest
reproof.
It
was
unpardonable.
I
cannot
think
of
it
without
abhorrence."
"We
will
not
quarrel
for
the
greater
share
of
blame
annexed
to
that
evening,"
said
Elizabeth.
"The
conduct
of
neither,
if
strictly
examined,
will
be
irreproachable;
but
since
then,
we
have
both,
I
hope,
improved
in
civility."
"I
cannot
be
so
easily
reconciled
to
myself.
The
recollection
of
what
I
then
said,
of
my
conduct,
my
manners,
my
expressions
during
the
whole
of
it,
is
now,
and
has
been
many
months,
inexpressibly
painful
to
me.
Your
reproof,
so
well
applied,
I
shall
never
forget:
'had
you
behaved
in
a
more
gentlemanlike
manner.'
Those
were
your
words.
You
know
not,
you
can
scarcely
conceive,
how
they
have
tortured
me;
though
it
was
some
time,
I
confess,
before
I
was
reasonable
enough
to
allow
their
justice."
"I
was
certainly
very
far
from
expecting
them
to
make
so
strong
an
impression.
I
had
not
the
smallest
idea
of
their
being
ever
felt
in
such
a
way."
"I
can
easily
believe
it.
You
thought
me
then
devoid
of
every
proper
feeling,
I
am
sure
you
did.
The
turn
of
your
countenance
I
shall
never
forget,
as
you
said
that
I
could
not
have
addressed
you
in
any
possible
way
that
would
induce
you
to
accept
me."
"Oh!
do
not
repeat
what
I
then
said.
These
recollections
will
not
do
at
all.
I
assure
you
that
I
have
long
been
most
heartily
ashamed
of
it."
Darcy
mentioned
his
letter.
"Did
it,"
said
he,
"did
it
soon
make
