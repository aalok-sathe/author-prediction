with
all
the
disadvantages
of
this
humble
parsonage,
I
should
not
think
anyone
abiding
in
it
an
object
of
compassion,
while
they
are
sharers
of
our
intimacy
at
Rosings."
Words
were
insufficient
for
the
elevation
of
his
feelings;
and
he
was
obliged
to
walk
about
the
room,
while
Elizabeth
tried
to
unite
civility
and
truth
in
a
few
short
sentences.
"You
may,
in
fact,
carry
a
very
favourable
report
of
us
into
Hertfordshire,
my
dear
cousin.
I
flatter
myself
at
least
that
you
will
be
able
to
do
so.
Lady
Catherine's
great
attentions
to
Mrs.
Collins
you
have
been
a
daily
witness
of;
and
altogether
I
trust
it
does
not
appear
that
your
friend
has
drawn
an
unfortunate
but
on
this
point
it
will
be
as
well
to
be
silent.
Only
let
me
assure
you,
my
dear
Miss
Elizabeth,
that
I
can
from
my
heart
most
cordially
wish
you
equal
felicity
in
marriage.
My
dear
Charlotte
and
I
have
but
one
mind
and
one
way
of
thinking.
There
is
in
everything
a
most
remarkable
resemblance
of
character
and
ideas
between
us.
We
seem
to
have
been
designed
for
each
other."
Elizabeth
could
safely
say
that
it
was
a
great
happiness
where
that
was
the
case,
and
with
equal
sincerity
could
add,
that
she
firmly
believed
and
rejoiced
in
his
domestic
comforts.
She
was
not
sorry,
however,
to
have
the
recital
of
them
interrupted
by
the
lady
from
whom
they
sprang.
Poor
Charlotte!
it
was
melancholy
to
leave
her
to
such
society!
But
she
had
chosen
it
with
her
eyes
open;
and
though
evidently
regretting
that
her
visitors
were
to
go,
she
did
not
seem
to
ask
for
compassion.
Her
home
and
her
housekeeping,
her
parish
and
her
poultry,
and
all
their
dependent
concerns,
had
not
yet
lost
their
charms.
At
length
the
chaise
arrived,
the
trunks
were
fastened
on,
the
parcels
placed
within,
and
it
was
pronounced
to
be
ready.
After
an
affectionate
parting
between
the
friends,
Elizabeth
was
attended
to
the
carriage
by
Mr.
Collins,
and
as
they
walked
down
the
garden
he
was
commissioning
her
with
his
best
respects
to
all
her
family,
not
forgetting
his
thanks
for
the
kindness
he
had
received
at
Longbourn
in
the
winter,
and
his
compliments
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner,
though
unknown.
He
then
handed
her
in,
Maria
followed,
and
the
door
was
on
the
point
of
being
closed,
when
he
suddenly
reminded
them,
with
some
consternation,
that
they
had
hitherto
forgotten
to
leave
any
message
for
the
ladies
at
Rosings.
"But,"
he
added,
"you
will
of
course
wish
to
have
your
humble
respects
delivered
to
them,
with
your
grateful
thanks
for
their
kindness
to
you
while
you
have
been
here."
Elizabeth
made
no
objection;
the
door
was
then
allowed
to
be
shut,
and
the
carriage
drove
off.
"Good
gracious!"
cried
Maria,
after
a
few
minutes'
silence,
"it
seems
but
a
day
or
two
since
we
first
came!
and
yet
how
many
things
have
happened!"
"A
great
many
indeed,"
said
her
companion
