to
her,
for
the
clownish
manner
which
might
be
offending
her
every
hour
of
the
day,
to
know
that
her
husband
could
write
a
good
letter."
"Oh!
yes,
very.
Nobody
cares
for
a
letter;
the
thing
is,
to
be
always
happy
with
pleasant
companions.
I
am
quite
determined
to
refuse
him.
But
how
shall
I
do?
What
shall
I
say?"
Emma
assured
her
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
answer,
and
advised
its
being
written
directly,
which
was
agreed
to,
in
the
hope
of
her
assistance;
and
though
Emma
continued
to
protest
against
any
assistance
being
wanted,
it
was
in
fact
given
in
the
formation
of
every
sentence.
The
looking
over
his
letter
again,
in
replying
to
it,
had
such
a
softening
tendency,
that
it
was
particularly
necessary
to
brace
her
up
with
a
few
decisive
expressions;
and
she
was
so
very
much
concerned
at
the
idea
of
making
him
unhappy,
and
thought
so
much
of
what
his
mother
and
sisters
would
think
and
say,
and
was
so
anxious
that
they
should
not
fancy
her
ungrateful,
that
Emma
believed
if
the
young
man
had
come
in
her
way
at
that
moment,
he
would
have
been
accepted
after
all.
This
letter,
however,
was
written,
and
sealed,
and
sent.
The
business
was
finished,
and
Harriet
safe.
She
was
rather
low
all
the
evening,
but
Emma
could
allow
for
her
amiable
regrets,
and
sometimes
relieved
them
by
speaking
of
her
own
affection,
sometimes
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
Mr.
Elton.
"I
shall
never
be
invited
to
Abbey
Mill
again,"
was
said
in
rather
a
sorrowful
tone.
"Nor,
if
you
were,
could
I
ever
bear
to
part
with
you,
my
Harriet.
You
are
a
great
deal
too
necessary
at
Hartfield
to
be
spared
to
Abbey
Mill."
"And
I
am
sure
I
should
never
want
to
go
there;
for
I
am
never
happy
but
at
Hartfield."
Some
time
afterwards
it
was,
"I
think
Mrs.
Goddard
would
be
very
much
surprized
if
she
knew
what
had
happened.
I
am
sure
Miss
Nash
would
for
Miss
Nash
thinks
her
own
sister
very
well
married,
and
it
is
only
a
linen
draper."
"One
should
be
sorry
to
see
greater
pride
or
refinement
in
the
teacher
of
a
school,
Harriet.
I
dare
say
Miss
Nash
would
envy
you
such
an
opportunity
as
this
of
being
married.
Even
this
conquest
would
appear
valuable
in
her
eyes.
As
to
any
thing
superior
for
you,
I
suppose
she
is
quite
in
the
dark.
The
attentions
of
a
certain
person
can
hardly
be
among
the
tittle
tattle
of
Highbury
yet.
Hitherto
I
fancy
you
and
I
are
the
only
people
to
whom
his
looks
and
manners
have
explained
themselves."
Harriet
blushed
and
smiled,
and
said
something
about
wondering
that
people
should
like
her
so
much.
The
idea
of
Mr.
Elton
was
certainly
cheering;
but
still,
after
a
time,
she
was
tender
hearted
again
towards
the
rejected
Mr.
Martin.
"Now
he
has
got
my
letter,"
said
she
softly.
"I
wonder
what
