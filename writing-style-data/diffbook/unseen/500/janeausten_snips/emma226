inexpressible
obligation!
The
very
recollection
of
it,
and
all
that
I
felt
at
the
time
when
I
saw
him
coming
his
noble
look
and
my
wretchedness
before.
Such
a
change!
In
one
moment
such
a
change!
From
perfect
misery
to
perfect
happiness!"
"It
is
very
natural.
It
is
natural,
and
it
is
honourable.
Yes,
honourable,
I
think,
to
chuse
so
well
and
so
gratefully.
But
that
it
will
be
a
fortunate
preference
is
more
than
I
can
promise.
I
do
not
advise
you
to
give
way
to
it,
Harriet.
I
do
not
by
any
means
engage
for
its
being
returned.
Consider
what
you
are
about.
Perhaps
it
will
be
wisest
in
you
to
check
your
feelings
while
you
can:
at
any
rate
do
not
let
them
carry
you
far,
unless
you
are
persuaded
of
his
liking
you.
Be
observant
of
him.
Let
his
behaviour
be
the
guide
of
your
sensations.
I
give
you
this
caution
now,
because
I
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
on
the
subject.
I
am
determined
against
all
interference.
Henceforward
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter.
Let
no
name
ever
pass
our
lips.
We
were
very
wrong
before;
we
will
be
cautious
now.
He
is
your
superior,
no
doubt,
and
there
do
seem
objections
and
obstacles
of
a
very
serious
nature;
but
yet,
Harriet,
more
wonderful
things
have
taken
place,
there
have
been
matches
of
greater
disparity.
But
take
care
of
yourself.
I
would
not
have
you
too
sanguine;
though,
however
it
may
end,
be
assured
your
raising
your
thoughts
to
him,
is
a
mark
of
good
taste
which
I
shall
always
know
how
to
value."
Harriet
kissed
her
hand
in
silent
and
submissive
gratitude.
Emma
was
very
decided
in
thinking
such
an
attachment
no
bad
thing
for
her
friend.
Its
tendency
would
be
to
raise
and
refine
her
mind
and
it
must
be
saving
her
from
the
danger
of
degradation.
In
this
state
of
schemes,
and
hopes,
and
connivance,
June
opened
upon
Hartfield.
To
Highbury
in
general
it
brought
no
material
change.
The
Eltons
were
still
talking
of
a
visit
from
the
Sucklings,
and
of
the
use
to
be
made
of
their
barouche
landau;
and
Jane
Fairfax
was
still
at
her
grandmother's;
and
as
the
return
of
the
Campbells
from
Ireland
was
again
delayed,
and
August,
instead
of
Midsummer,
fixed
for
it,
she
was
likely
to
remain
there
full
two
months
longer,
provided
at
least
she
were
able
to
defeat
Mrs.
Elton's
activity
in
her
service,
and
save
herself
from
being
hurried
into
a
delightful
situation
against
her
will.
Mr.
Knightley,
who,
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself,
had
certainly
taken
an
early
dislike
to
Frank
Churchill,
was
only
growing
to
dislike
him
more.
He
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
double
dealing
in
his
pursuit
of
Emma.
That
Emma
was
his
object
appeared
indisputable.
Every
thing
declared
it;
his
own
attentions,
his
father's
hints,
his
mother
in
law's
guarded
silence;
it
was
all
in
unison;
words,
conduct,
discretion,
and
indiscretion,
told
the
same
