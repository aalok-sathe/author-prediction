to
be
acted
upon.
May
I
hope
for
the
honour
of
your
hand
for
the
two
first
dances
of
this
little
projected
ball,
to
be
given,
not
at
Randalls,
but
at
the
Crown
Inn?"
"The
Crown!"
"Yes;
if
you
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
see
no
objection,
and
I
trust
you
cannot,
my
father
hopes
his
friends
will
be
so
kind
as
to
visit
him
there.
Better
accommodations,
he
can
promise
them,
and
not
a
less
grateful
welcome
than
at
Randalls.
It
is
his
own
idea.
Mrs.
Weston
sees
no
objection
to
it,
provided
you
are
satisfied.
This
is
what
we
all
feel.
Oh!
you
were
perfectly
right!
Ten
couple,
in
either
of
the
Randalls
rooms,
would
have
been
insufferable!
Dreadful!
I
felt
how
right
you
were
the
whole
time,
but
was
too
anxious
for
securing
any
thing
to
like
to
yield.
Is
not
it
a
good
exchange?
You
consent
I
hope
you
consent?"
"It
appears
to
me
a
plan
that
nobody
can
object
to,
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
do
not.
I
think
it
admirable;
and,
as
far
as
I
can
answer
for
myself,
shall
be
most
happy
It
seems
the
only
improvement
that
could
be.
Papa,
do
you
not
think
it
an
excellent
improvement?"
She
was
obliged
to
repeat
and
explain
it,
before
it
was
fully
comprehended;
and
then,
being
quite
new,
farther
representations
were
necessary
to
make
it
acceptable.
"No;
he
thought
it
very
far
from
an
improvement
a
very
bad
plan
much
worse
than
the
other.
A
room
at
an
inn
was
always
damp
and
dangerous;
never
properly
aired,
or
fit
to
be
inhabited.
If
they
must
dance,
they
had
better
dance
at
Randalls.
He
had
never
been
in
the
room
at
the
Crown
in
his
life
did
not
know
the
people
who
kept
it
by
sight.
Oh!
no
a
very
bad
plan.
They
would
catch
worse
colds
at
the
Crown
than
anywhere."
"I
was
going
to
observe,
sir,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
"that
one
of
the
great
recommendations
of
this
change
would
be
the
very
little
danger
of
any
body's
catching
cold
so
much
less
danger
at
the
Crown
than
at
Randalls!
Mr.
Perry
might
have
reason
to
regret
the
alteration,
but
nobody
else
could."
"Sir,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse,
rather
warmly,
"you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
suppose
Mr.
Perry
to
be
that
sort
of
character.
Mr.
Perry
is
extremely
concerned
when
any
of
us
are
ill.
But
I
do
not
understand
how
the
room
at
the
Crown
can
be
safer
for
you
than
your
father's
house."
"From
the
very
circumstance
of
its
being
larger,
sir.
We
shall
have
no
occasion
to
open
the
windows
at
all
not
once
the
whole
evening;
and
it
is
that
dreadful
habit
of
opening
the
windows,
letting
in
cold
air
upon
heated
bodies,
which
(as
you
well
know,
sir)
does
the
mischief."
"Open
the
windows!
but
surely,
Mr.
Churchill,
nobody
would
think
of
opening
the
windows
at
Randalls.
Nobody
could
be
so
imprudent!
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing.
