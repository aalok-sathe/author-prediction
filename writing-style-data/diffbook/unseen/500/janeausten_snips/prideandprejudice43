evening
she
was
his
settled
choice.
The
next
morning,
however,
made
an
alteration;
for
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour's
tete
a
tete
with
Mrs.
Bennet
before
breakfast,
a
conversation
beginning
with
his
parsonage
house,
and
leading
naturally
to
the
avowal
of
his
hopes,
that
a
mistress
might
be
found
for
it
at
Longbourn,
produced
from
her,
amid
very
complaisant
smiles
and
general
encouragement,
a
caution
against
the
very
Jane
he
had
fixed
on.
"As
to
her
younger
daughters,
she
could
not
take
upon
her
to
say
she
could
not
positively
answer
but
she
did
not
know
of
any
prepossession;
her
eldest
daughter,
she
must
just
mention
she
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
to
hint,
was
likely
to
be
very
soon
engaged."
Mr.
Collins
had
only
to
change
from
Jane
to
Elizabeth
and
it
was
soon
done
done
while
Mrs.
Bennet
was
stirring
the
fire.
Elizabeth,
equally
next
to
Jane
in
birth
and
beauty,
succeeded
her
of
course.
Mrs.
Bennet
treasured
up
the
hint,
and
trusted
that
she
might
soon
have
two
daughters
married;
and
the
man
whom
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
of
the
day
before
was
now
high
in
her
good
graces.
Lydia's
intention
of
walking
to
Meryton
was
not
forgotten;
every
sister
except
Mary
agreed
to
go
with
her;
and
Mr.
Collins
was
to
attend
them,
at
the
request
of
Mr.
Bennet,
who
was
most
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him,
and
have
his
library
to
himself;
for
thither
Mr.
Collins
had
followed
him
after
breakfast;
and
there
he
would
continue,
nominally
engaged
with
one
of
the
largest
folios
in
the
collection,
but
really
talking
to
Mr.
Bennet,
with
little
cessation,
of
his
house
and
garden
at
Hunsford.
Such
doings
discomposed
Mr.
Bennet
exceedingly.
In
his
library
he
had
been
always
sure
of
leisure
and
tranquillity;
and
though
prepared,
as
he
told
Elizabeth,
to
meet
with
folly
and
conceit
in
every
other
room
of
the
house,
he
was
used
to
be
free
from
them
there;
his
civility,
therefore,
was
most
prompt
in
inviting
Mr.
Collins
to
join
his
daughters
in
their
walk;
and
Mr.
Collins,
being
in
fact
much
better
fitted
for
a
walker
than
a
reader,
was
extremely
pleased
to
close
his
large
book,
and
go.
In
pompous
nothings
on
his
side,
and
civil
assents
on
that
of
his
cousins,
their
time
passed
till
they
entered
Meryton.
The
attention
of
the
younger
ones
was
then
no
longer
to
be
gained
by
him.
Their
eyes
were
immediately
wandering
up
in
the
street
in
quest
of
the
officers,
and
nothing
less
than
a
very
smart
bonnet
indeed,
or
a
really
new
muslin
in
a
shop
window,
could
recall
them.
But
the
attention
of
every
lady
was
soon
caught
by
a
young
man,
whom
they
had
never
seen
before,
of
most
gentlemanlike
appearance,
walking
with
another
officer
on
the
other
side
of
the
way.
The
officer
was
the
very
Mr.
Denny
concerning
whose
return
from
London
Lydia
came
to
inquire,
and
he
bowed
as
they
passed.
All
were
