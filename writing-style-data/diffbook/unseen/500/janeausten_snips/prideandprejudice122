park;
he
was
moving
that
way;
and,
fearful
of
its
being
Mr.
Darcy,
she
was
directly
retreating.
But
the
person
who
advanced
was
now
near
enough
to
see
her,
and
stepping
forward
with
eagerness,
pronounced
her
name.
She
had
turned
away;
but
on
hearing
herself
called,
though
in
a
voice
which
proved
it
to
be
Mr.
Darcy,
she
moved
again
towards
the
gate.
He
had
by
that
time
reached
it
also,
and,
holding
out
a
letter,
which
she
instinctively
took,
said,
with
a
look
of
haughty
composure,
"I
have
been
walking
in
the
grove
some
time
in
the
hope
of
meeting
you.
Will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
reading
that
letter?"
And
then,
with
a
slight
bow,
turned
again
into
the
plantation,
and
was
soon
out
of
sight.
With
no
expectation
of
pleasure,
but
with
the
strongest
curiosity,
Elizabeth
opened
the
letter,
and,
to
her
still
increasing
wonder,
perceived
an
envelope
containing
two
sheets
of
letter
paper,
written
quite
through,
in
a
very
close
hand.
The
envelope
itself
was
likewise
full.
Pursuing
her
way
along
the
lane,
she
then
began
it.
It
was
dated
from
Rosings,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning,
and
was
as
follows:
"Be
not
alarmed,
madam,
on
receiving
this
letter,
by
the
apprehension
of
its
containing
any
repetition
of
those
sentiments
or
renewal
of
those
offers
which
were
last
night
so
disgusting
to
you.
I
write
without
any
intention
of
paining
you,
or
humbling
myself,
by
dwelling
on
wishes
which,
for
the
happiness
of
both,
cannot
be
too
soon
forgotten;
and
the
effort
which
the
formation
and
the
perusal
of
this
letter
must
occasion,
should
have
been
spared,
had
not
my
character
required
it
to
be
written
and
read.
You
must,
therefore,
pardon
the
freedom
with
which
I
demand
your
attention;
your
feelings,
I
know,
will
bestow
it
unwillingly,
but
I
demand
it
of
your
justice.
"Two
offenses
of
a
very
different
nature,
and
by
no
means
of
equal
magnitude,
you
last
night
laid
to
my
charge.
The
first
mentioned
was,
that,
regardless
of
the
sentiments
of
either,
I
had
detached
Mr.
Bingley
from
your
sister,
and
the
other,
that
I
had,
in
defiance
of
various
claims,
in
defiance
of
honour
and
humanity,
ruined
the
immediate
prosperity
and
blasted
the
prospects
of
Mr.
Wickham.
Wilfully
and
wantonly
to
have
thrown
off
the
companion
of
my
youth,
the
acknowledged
favourite
of
my
father,
a
young
man
who
had
scarcely
any
other
dependence
than
on
our
patronage,
and
who
had
been
brought
up
to
expect
its
exertion,
would
be
a
depravity,
to
which
the
separation
of
two
young
persons,
whose
affection
could
be
the
growth
of
only
a
few
weeks,
could
bear
no
comparison.
But
from
the
severity
of
that
blame
which
was
last
night
so
liberally
bestowed,
respecting
each
circumstance,
I
shall
hope
to
be
in
the
future
secured,
when
the
following
account
of
my
actions
and
their
motives
has
been
read.
If,
in
the
explanation
of
them,
which
is
due
to
myself,
I
am
under
