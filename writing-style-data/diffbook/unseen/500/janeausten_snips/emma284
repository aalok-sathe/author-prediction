them
to
be
very
mutually
and
very
sincerely
attached."
"He
is
a
most
fortunate
man!"
returned
Mr.
Knightley,
with
energy.
"So
early
in
life
at
three
and
twenty
a
period
when,
if
a
man
chuses
a
wife,
he
generally
chuses
ill.
At
three
and
twenty
to
have
drawn
such
a
prize!
What
years
of
felicity
that
man,
in
all
human
calculation,
has
before
him!
Assured
of
the
love
of
such
a
woman
the
disinterested
love,
for
Jane
Fairfax's
character
vouches
for
her
disinterestedness;
every
thing
in
his
favour,
equality
of
situation
I
mean,
as
far
as
regards
society,
and
all
the
habits
and
manners
that
are
important;
equality
in
every
point
but
one
and
that
one,
since
the
purity
of
her
heart
is
not
to
be
doubted,
such
as
must
increase
his
felicity,
for
it
will
be
his
to
bestow
the
only
advantages
she
wants.
A
man
would
always
wish
to
give
a
woman
a
better
home
than
the
one
he
takes
her
from;
and
he
who
can
do
it,
where
there
is
no
doubt
of
her
regard,
must,
I
think,
be
the
happiest
of
mortals.
Frank
Churchill
is,
indeed,
the
favourite
of
fortune.
Every
thing
turns
out
for
his
good.
He
meets
with
a
young
woman
at
a
watering
place,
gains
her
affection,
cannot
even
weary
her
by
negligent
treatment
and
had
he
and
all
his
family
sought
round
the
world
for
a
perfect
wife
for
him,
they
could
not
have
found
her
superior.
His
aunt
is
in
the
way.
His
aunt
dies.
He
has
only
to
speak.
His
friends
are
eager
to
promote
his
happiness.
He
had
used
every
body
ill
and
they
are
all
delighted
to
forgive
him.
He
is
a
fortunate
man
indeed!"
"You
speak
as
if
you
envied
him."
"And
I
do
envy
him,
Emma.
In
one
respect
he
is
the
object
of
my
envy."
Emma
could
say
no
more.
They
seemed
to
be
within
half
a
sentence
of
Harriet,
and
her
immediate
feeling
was
to
avert
the
subject,
if
possible.
She
made
her
plan;
she
would
speak
of
something
totally
different
the
children
in
Brunswick
Square;
and
she
only
waited
for
breath
to
begin,
when
Mr.
Knightley
startled
her,
by
saying,
"You
will
not
ask
me
what
is
the
point
of
envy.
You
are
determined,
I
see,
to
have
no
curiosity.
You
are
wise
but
I
cannot
be
wise.
Emma,
I
must
tell
you
what
you
will
not
ask,
though
I
may
wish
it
unsaid
the
next
moment."
"Oh!
then,
don't
speak
it,
don't
speak
it,"
she
eagerly
cried.
"Take
a
little
time,
consider,
do
not
commit
yourself."
"Thank
you,"
said
he,
in
an
accent
of
deep
mortification,
and
not
another
syllable
followed.
Emma
could
not
bear
to
give
him
pain.
He
was
wishing
to
confide
in
her
perhaps
to
consult
her;
cost
her
what
it
would,
she
would
listen.
She
might
assist
his
resolution,
or
reconcile
him
to
it;
she
might
give
just
praise
to
Harriet,
or,
by
representing
to
him
his
own
