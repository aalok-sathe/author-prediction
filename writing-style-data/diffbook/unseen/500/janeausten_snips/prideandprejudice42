Richard;
and
if
he
does,
Colonel
Forster
will
hire
him.
My
aunt
told
me
so
herself
on
Saturday.
I
shall
walk
to
Meryton
to
morrow
to
hear
more
about
it,
and
to
ask
when
Mr.
Denny
comes
back
from
town."
Lydia
was
bid
by
her
two
eldest
sisters
to
hold
her
tongue;
but
Mr.
Collins,
much
offended,
laid
aside
his
book,
and
said:
"I
have
often
observed
how
little
young
ladies
are
interested
by
books
of
a
serious
stamp,
though
written
solely
for
their
benefit.
It
amazes
me,
I
confess;
for,
certainly,
there
can
be
nothing
so
advantageous
to
them
as
instruction.
But
I
will
no
longer
importune
my
young
cousin."
Then
turning
to
Mr.
Bennet,
he
offered
himself
as
his
antagonist
at
backgammon.
Mr.
Bennet
accepted
the
challenge,
observing
that
he
acted
very
wisely
in
leaving
the
girls
to
their
own
trifling
amusements.
Mrs.
Bennet
and
her
daughters
apologised
most
civilly
for
Lydia's
interruption,
and
promised
that
it
should
not
occur
again,
if
he
would
resume
his
book;
but
Mr.
Collins,
after
assuring
them
that
he
bore
his
young
cousin
no
ill
will,
and
should
never
resent
her
behaviour
as
any
affront,
seated
himself
at
another
table
with
Mr.
Bennet,
and
prepared
for
backgammon.
Mr.
Collins
was
not
a
sensible
man,
and
the
deficiency
of
nature
had
been
but
little
assisted
by
education
or
society;
the
greatest
part
of
his
life
having
been
spent
under
the
guidance
of
an
illiterate
and
miserly
father;
and
though
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
universities,
he
had
merely
kept
the
necessary
terms,
without
forming
at
it
any
useful
acquaintance.
The
subjection
in
which
his
father
had
brought
him
up
had
given
him
originally
great
humility
of
manner;
but
it
was
now
a
good
deal
counteracted
by
the
self
conceit
of
a
weak
head,
living
in
retirement,
and
the
consequential
feelings
of
early
and
unexpected
prosperity.
A
fortunate
chance
had
recommended
him
to
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
when
the
living
of
Hunsford
was
vacant;
and
the
respect
which
he
felt
for
her
high
rank,
and
his
veneration
for
her
as
his
patroness,
mingling
with
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself,
of
his
authority
as
a
clergyman,
and
his
right
as
a
rector,
made
him
altogether
a
mixture
of
pride
and
obsequiousness,
self
importance
and
humility.
Having
now
a
good
house
and
a
very
sufficient
income,
he
intended
to
marry;
and
in
seeking
a
reconciliation
with
the
Longbourn
family
he
had
a
wife
in
view,
as
he
meant
to
choose
one
of
the
daughters,
if
he
found
them
as
handsome
and
amiable
as
they
were
represented
by
common
report.
This
was
his
plan
of
amends
of
atonement
for
inheriting
their
father's
estate;
and
he
thought
it
an
excellent
one,
full
of
eligibility
and
suitableness,
and
excessively
generous
and
disinterested
on
his
own
part.
His
plan
did
not
vary
on
seeing
them.
Miss
Bennet's
lovely
face
confirmed
his
views,
and
established
all
his
strictest
notions
of
what
was
due
to
seniority;
and
for
the
first
