"You
would
not
have
encouraged
me,
then,
if
you
had
understood
me?
At
least,
however,
I
cannot
be
worse
off
than
I
should
have
been,
if
the
other
had
been
the
person;
and
now
it
is
possible
"
She
paused
a
few
moments.
Emma
could
not
speak.
"I
do
not
wonder,
Miss
Woodhouse,"
she
resumed,
"that
you
should
feel
a
great
difference
between
the
two,
as
to
me
or
as
to
any
body.
You
must
think
one
five
hundred
million
times
more
above
me
than
the
other.
But
I
hope,
Miss
Woodhouse,
that
supposing
that
if
strange
as
it
may
appear
.
But
you
know
they
were
your
own
words,
that
more
wonderful
things
had
happened,
matches
of
greater
disparity
had
taken
place
than
between
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
me;
and,
therefore,
it
seems
as
if
such
a
thing
even
as
this,
may
have
occurred
before
and
if
I
should
be
so
fortunate,
beyond
expression,
as
to
if
Mr.
Knightley
should
really
if
he
does
not
mind
the
disparity,
I
hope,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
will
not
set
yourself
against
it,
and
try
to
put
difficulties
in
the
way.
But
you
are
too
good
for
that,
I
am
sure."
Harriet
was
standing
at
one
of
the
windows.
Emma
turned
round
to
look
at
her
in
consternation,
and
hastily
said,
"Have
you
any
idea
of
Mr.
Knightley's
returning
your
affection?"
"Yes,"
replied
Harriet
modestly,
but
not
fearfully
"I
must
say
that
I
have."
Emma's
eyes
were
instantly
withdrawn;
and
she
sat
silently
meditating,
in
a
fixed
attitude,
for
a
few
minutes.
A
few
minutes
were
sufficient
for
making
her
acquainted
with
her
own
heart.
A
mind
like
hers,
once
opening
to
suspicion,
made
rapid
progress.
She
touched
she
admitted
she
acknowledged
the
whole
truth.
Why
was
it
so
much
worse
that
Harriet
should
be
in
love
with
Mr.
Knightley,
than
with
Frank
Churchill?
Why
was
the
evil
so
dreadfully
increased
by
Harriet's
having
some
hope
of
a
return?
It
darted
through
her,
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow,
that
Mr.
Knightley
must
marry
no
one
but
herself!
Her
own
conduct,
as
well
as
her
own
heart,
was
before
her
in
the
same
few
minutes.
She
saw
it
all
with
a
clearness
which
had
never
blessed
her
before.
How
improperly
had
she
been
acting
by
Harriet!
How
inconsiderate,
how
indelicate,
how
irrational,
how
unfeeling
had
been
her
conduct!
What
blindness,
what
madness,
had
led
her
on!
It
struck
her
with
dreadful
force,
and
she
was
ready
to
give
it
every
bad
name
in
the
world.
Some
portion
of
respect
for
herself,
however,
in
spite
of
all
these
demerits
some
concern
for
her
own
appearance,
and
a
strong
sense
of
justice
by
Harriet
(there
would
be
no
need
of
compassion
to
the
girl
who
believed
herself
loved
by
Mr.
Knightley
but
justice
required
that
she
should
not
be
made
unhappy
by
any
coldness
now,)
gave
Emma
the
resolution
to
sit
and
endure
farther
with
calmness,
with
even
apparent
kindness.
For
her
own
advantage
