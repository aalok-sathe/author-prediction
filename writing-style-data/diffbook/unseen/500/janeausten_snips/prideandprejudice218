awkward
enough;
but
hers
she
thought
was
still
worse.
Not
a
syllable
was
uttered
by
either;
and
Elizabeth
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
again,
when
Bingley,
who
as
well
as
the
other
had
sat
down,
suddenly
rose,
and
whispering
a
few
words
to
her
sister,
ran
out
of
the
room.
Jane
could
have
no
reserves
from
Elizabeth,
where
confidence
would
give
pleasure;
and
instantly
embracing
her,
acknowledged,
with
the
liveliest
emotion,
that
she
was
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world.
"'Tis
too
much!"
she
added,
"by
far
too
much.
I
do
not
deserve
it.
Oh!
why
is
not
everybody
as
happy?"
Elizabeth's
congratulations
were
given
with
a
sincerity,
a
warmth,
a
delight,
which
words
could
but
poorly
express.
Every
sentence
of
kindness
was
a
fresh
source
of
happiness
to
Jane.
But
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
stay
with
her
sister,
or
say
half
that
remained
to
be
said
for
the
present.
"I
must
go
instantly
to
my
mother;"
she
cried.
"I
would
not
on
any
account
trifle
with
her
affectionate
solicitude;
or
allow
her
to
hear
it
from
anyone
but
myself.
He
is
gone
to
my
father
already.
Oh!
Lizzy,
to
know
that
what
I
have
to
relate
will
give
such
pleasure
to
all
my
dear
family!
how
shall
I
bear
so
much
happiness!"
She
then
hastened
away
to
her
mother,
who
had
purposely
broken
up
the
card
party,
and
was
sitting
up
stairs
with
Kitty.
Elizabeth,
who
was
left
by
herself,
now
smiled
at
the
rapidity
and
ease
with
which
an
affair
was
finally
settled,
that
had
given
them
so
many
previous
months
of
suspense
and
vexation.
"And
this,"
said
she,
"is
the
end
of
all
his
friend's
anxious
circumspection!
of
all
his
sister's
falsehood
and
contrivance!
the
happiest,
wisest,
most
reasonable
end!"
In
a
few
minutes
she
was
joined
by
Bingley,
whose
conference
with
her
father
had
been
short
and
to
the
purpose.
"Where
is
your
sister?"
said
he
hastily,
as
he
opened
the
door.
"With
my
mother
up
stairs.
She
will
be
down
in
a
moment,
I
dare
say."
He
then
shut
the
door,
and,
coming
up
to
her,
claimed
the
good
wishes
and
affection
of
a
sister.
Elizabeth
honestly
and
heartily
expressed
her
delight
in
the
prospect
of
their
relationship.
They
shook
hands
with
great
cordiality;
and
then,
till
her
sister
came
down,
she
had
to
listen
to
all
he
had
to
say
of
his
own
happiness,
and
of
Jane's
perfections;
and
in
spite
of
his
being
a
lover,
Elizabeth
really
believed
all
his
expectations
of
felicity
to
be
rationally
founded,
because
they
had
for
basis
the
excellent
understanding,
and
super
excellent
disposition
of
Jane,
and
a
general
similarity
of
feeling
and
taste
between
her
and
himself.
It
was
an
evening
of
no
common
delight
to
them
all;
the
satisfaction
of
Miss
Bennet's
mind
gave
a
glow
of
such
sweet
animation
to
her
face,
as
made
her
look
handsomer
than
ever.
Kitty
simpered
and
smiled,
and
hoped
her
turn
was
coming
soon.
Mrs.
