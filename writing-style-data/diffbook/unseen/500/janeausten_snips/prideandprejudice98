his
humble
abode,
and
punctually
repeated
all
his
wife's
offers
of
refreshment.
Elizabeth
was
prepared
to
see
him
in
his
glory;
and
she
could
not
help
in
fancying
that
in
displaying
the
good
proportion
of
the
room,
its
aspect
and
its
furniture,
he
addressed
himself
particularly
to
her,
as
if
wishing
to
make
her
feel
what
she
had
lost
in
refusing
him.
But
though
everything
seemed
neat
and
comfortable,
she
was
not
able
to
gratify
him
by
any
sigh
of
repentance,
and
rather
looked
with
wonder
at
her
friend
that
she
could
have
so
cheerful
an
air
with
such
a
companion.
When
Mr.
Collins
said
anything
of
which
his
wife
might
reasonably
be
ashamed,
which
certainly
was
not
unseldom,
she
involuntarily
turned
her
eye
on
Charlotte.
Once
or
twice
she
could
discern
a
faint
blush;
but
in
general
Charlotte
wisely
did
not
hear.
After
sitting
long
enough
to
admire
every
article
of
furniture
in
the
room,
from
the
sideboard
to
the
fender,
to
give
an
account
of
their
journey,
and
of
all
that
had
happened
in
London,
Mr.
Collins
invited
them
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
garden,
which
was
large
and
well
laid
out,
and
to
the
cultivation
of
which
he
attended
himself.
To
work
in
this
garden
was
one
of
his
most
respectable
pleasures;
and
Elizabeth
admired
the
command
of
countenance
with
which
Charlotte
talked
of
the
healthfulness
of
the
exercise,
and
owned
she
encouraged
it
as
much
as
possible.
Here,
leading
the
way
through
every
walk
and
cross
walk,
and
scarcely
allowing
them
an
interval
to
utter
the
praises
he
asked
for,
every
view
was
pointed
out
with
a
minuteness
which
left
beauty
entirely
behind.
He
could
number
the
fields
in
every
direction,
and
could
tell
how
many
trees
there
were
in
the
most
distant
clump.
But
of
all
the
views
which
his
garden,
or
which
the
country
or
kingdom
could
boast,
none
were
to
be
compared
with
the
prospect
of
Rosings,
afforded
by
an
opening
in
the
trees
that
bordered
the
park
nearly
opposite
the
front
of
his
house.
It
was
a
handsome
modern
building,
well
situated
on
rising
ground.
From
his
garden,
Mr.
Collins
would
have
led
them
round
his
two
meadows;
but
the
ladies,
not
having
shoes
to
encounter
the
remains
of
a
white
frost,
turned
back;
and
while
Sir
William
accompanied
him,
Charlotte
took
her
sister
and
friend
over
the
house,
extremely
well
pleased,
probably,
to
have
the
opportunity
of
showing
it
without
her
husband's
help.
It
was
rather
small,
but
well
built
and
convenient;
and
everything
was
fitted
up
and
arranged
with
a
neatness
and
consistency
of
which
Elizabeth
gave
Charlotte
all
the
credit.
When
Mr.
Collins
could
be
forgotten,
there
was
really
an
air
of
great
comfort
throughout,
and
by
Charlotte's
evident
enjoyment
of
it,
Elizabeth
supposed
he
must
be
often
forgotten.
She
had
already
learnt
that
Lady
Catherine
was
still
in
the
country.
It
was
spoken
of
again
while
they
were
at
dinner,
when
Mr.
Collins
joining
in,
observed:
"Yes,
