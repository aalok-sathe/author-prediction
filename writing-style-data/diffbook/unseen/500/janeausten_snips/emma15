so
did
their
satisfaction
in
each
other.
As
a
walking
companion,
Emma
had
very
early
foreseen
how
useful
she
might
find
her.
In
that
respect
Mrs.
Weston's
loss
had
been
important.
Her
father
never
went
beyond
the
shrubbery,
where
two
divisions
of
the
ground
sufficed
him
for
his
long
walk,
or
his
short,
as
the
year
varied;
and
since
Mrs.
Weston's
marriage
her
exercise
had
been
too
much
confined.
She
had
ventured
once
alone
to
Randalls,
but
it
was
not
pleasant;
and
a
Harriet
Smith,
therefore,
one
whom
she
could
summon
at
any
time
to
a
walk,
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
her
privileges.
But
in
every
respect,
as
she
saw
more
of
her,
she
approved
her,
and
was
confirmed
in
all
her
kind
designs.
Harriet
certainly
was
not
clever,
but
she
had
a
sweet,
docile,
grateful
disposition,
was
totally
free
from
conceit,
and
only
desiring
to
be
guided
by
any
one
she
looked
up
to.
Her
early
attachment
to
herself
was
very
amiable;
and
her
inclination
for
good
company,
and
power
of
appreciating
what
was
elegant
and
clever,
shewed
that
there
was
no
want
of
taste,
though
strength
of
understanding
must
not
be
expected.
Altogether
she
was
quite
convinced
of
Harriet
Smith's
being
exactly
the
young
friend
she
wanted
exactly
the
something
which
her
home
required.
Such
a
friend
as
Mrs.
Weston
was
out
of
the
question.
Two
such
could
never
be
granted.
Two
such
she
did
not
want.
It
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing,
a
sentiment
distinct
and
independent.
Mrs.
Weston
was
the
object
of
a
regard
which
had
its
basis
in
gratitude
and
esteem.
Harriet
would
be
loved
as
one
to
whom
she
could
be
useful.
For
Mrs.
Weston
there
was
nothing
to
be
done;
for
Harriet
every
thing.
Her
first
attempts
at
usefulness
were
in
an
endeavour
to
find
out
who
were
the
parents,
but
Harriet
could
not
tell.
She
was
ready
to
tell
every
thing
in
her
power,
but
on
this
subject
questions
were
vain.
Emma
was
obliged
to
fancy
what
she
liked
but
she
could
never
believe
that
in
the
same
situation
she
should
not
have
discovered
the
truth.
Harriet
had
no
penetration.
She
had
been
satisfied
to
hear
and
believe
just
what
Mrs.
Goddard
chose
to
tell
her;
and
looked
no
farther.
Mrs.
Goddard,
and
the
teachers,
and
the
girls
and
the
affairs
of
the
school
in
general,
formed
naturally
a
great
part
of
the
conversation
and
but
for
her
acquaintance
with
the
Martins
of
Abbey
Mill
Farm,
it
must
have
been
the
whole.
But
the
Martins
occupied
her
thoughts
a
good
deal;
she
had
spent
two
very
happy
months
with
them,
and
now
loved
to
talk
of
the
pleasures
of
her
visit,
and
describe
the
many
comforts
and
wonders
of
the
place.
Emma
encouraged
her
talkativeness
amused
by
such
a
picture
of
another
set
of
beings,
and
enjoying
the
youthful
simplicity
which
could
speak
with
so
much
exultation
of
Mrs.
Martin's
having
"two
parlours,
two
very
good
parlours,
indeed;
