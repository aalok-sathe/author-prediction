and
the
children.
But
in
what
proportions
it
should
be
divided
amongst
the
latter
depended
on
the
will
of
the
parents.
This
was
one
point,
with
regard
to
Lydia,
at
least,
which
was
now
to
be
settled,
and
Mr.
Bennet
could
have
no
hesitation
in
acceding
to
the
proposal
before
him.
In
terms
of
grateful
acknowledgment
for
the
kindness
of
his
brother,
though
expressed
most
concisely,
he
then
delivered
on
paper
his
perfect
approbation
of
all
that
was
done,
and
his
willingness
to
fulfil
the
engagements
that
had
been
made
for
him.
He
had
never
before
supposed
that,
could
Wickham
be
prevailed
on
to
marry
his
daughter,
it
would
be
done
with
so
little
inconvenience
to
himself
as
by
the
present
arrangement.
He
would
scarcely
be
ten
pounds
a
year
the
loser
by
the
hundred
that
was
to
be
paid
them;
for,
what
with
her
board
and
pocket
allowance,
and
the
continual
presents
in
money
which
passed
to
her
through
her
mother's
hands,
Lydia's
expenses
had
been
very
little
within
that
sum.
That
it
would
be
done
with
such
trifling
exertion
on
his
side,
too,
was
another
very
welcome
surprise;
for
his
wish
at
present
was
to
have
as
little
trouble
in
the
business
as
possible.
When
the
first
transports
of
rage
which
had
produced
his
activity
in
seeking
her
were
over,
he
naturally
returned
to
all
his
former
indolence.
His
letter
was
soon
dispatched;
for,
though
dilatory
in
undertaking
business,
he
was
quick
in
its
execution.
He
begged
to
know
further
particulars
of
what
he
was
indebted
to
his
brother,
but
was
too
angry
with
Lydia
to
send
any
message
to
her.
The
good
news
spread
quickly
through
the
house,
and
with
proportionate
speed
through
the
neighbourhood.
It
was
borne
in
the
latter
with
decent
philosophy.
To
be
sure,
it
would
have
been
more
for
the
advantage
of
conversation
had
Miss
Lydia
Bennet
come
upon
the
town;
or,
as
the
happiest
alternative,
been
secluded
from
the
world,
in
some
distant
farmhouse.
But
there
was
much
to
be
talked
of
in
marrying
her;
and
the
good
natured
wishes
for
her
well
doing
which
had
proceeded
before
from
all
the
spiteful
old
ladies
in
Meryton
lost
but
a
little
of
their
spirit
in
this
change
of
circumstances,
because
with
such
an
husband
her
misery
was
considered
certain.
It
was
a
fortnight
since
Mrs.
Bennet
had
been
downstairs;
but
on
this
happy
day
she
again
took
her
seat
at
the
head
of
her
table,
and
in
spirits
oppressively
high.
No
sentiment
of
shame
gave
a
damp
to
her
triumph.
The
marriage
of
a
daughter,
which
had
been
the
first
object
of
her
wishes
since
Jane
was
sixteen,
was
now
on
the
point
of
accomplishment,
and
her
thoughts
and
her
words
ran
wholly
on
those
attendants
of
elegant
nuptials,
fine
muslins,
new
carriages,
and
servants.
She
was
busily
searching
through
the
neighbourhood
for
a
proper
situation
for
her
daughter,
and,
without
knowing
or
considering
what
their
income
might
be,
rejected
many
as
deficient
