must
confess
that
the
nature
of
her
complaint
alarmed
him
considerably."
And
in
this
style
he
talked
on
for
some
time
very
properly,
not
much
attending
to
any
answer,
but
altogether
sufficiently
awake
to
the
terror
of
a
bad
sore
throat;
and
Emma
was
quite
in
charity
with
him.
But
at
last
there
seemed
a
perverse
turn;
it
seemed
all
at
once
as
if
he
were
more
afraid
of
its
being
a
bad
sore
throat
on
her
account,
than
on
Harriet's
more
anxious
that
she
should
escape
the
infection,
than
that
there
should
be
no
infection
in
the
complaint.
He
began
with
great
earnestness
to
entreat
her
to
refrain
from
visiting
the
sick
chamber
again,
for
the
present
to
entreat
her
to
promise
him
not
to
venture
into
such
hazard
till
he
had
seen
Mr.
Perry
and
learnt
his
opinion;
and
though
she
tried
to
laugh
it
off
and
bring
the
subject
back
into
its
proper
course,
there
was
no
putting
an
end
to
his
extreme
solicitude
about
her.
She
was
vexed.
It
did
appear
there
was
no
concealing
it
exactly
like
the
pretence
of
being
in
love
with
her,
instead
of
Harriet;
an
inconstancy,
if
real,
the
most
contemptible
and
abominable!
and
she
had
difficulty
in
behaving
with
temper.
He
turned
to
Mrs.
Weston
to
implore
her
assistance,
"Would
not
she
give
him
her
support?
would
not
she
add
her
persuasions
to
his,
to
induce
Miss
Woodhouse
not
to
go
to
Mrs.
Goddard's
till
it
were
certain
that
Miss
Smith's
disorder
had
no
infection?
He
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
promise
would
not
she
give
him
her
influence
in
procuring
it?"
"So
scrupulous
for
others,"
he
continued,
"and
yet
so
careless
for
herself!
She
wanted
me
to
nurse
my
cold
by
staying
at
home
to
day,
and
yet
will
not
promise
to
avoid
the
danger
of
catching
an
ulcerated
sore
throat
herself.
Is
this
fair,
Mrs.
Weston?
Judge
between
us.
Have
not
I
some
right
to
complain?
I
am
sure
of
your
kind
support
and
aid."
Emma
saw
Mrs.
Weston's
surprize,
and
felt
that
it
must
be
great,
at
an
address
which,
in
words
and
manner,
was
assuming
to
himself
the
right
of
first
interest
in
her;
and
as
for
herself,
she
was
too
much
provoked
and
offended
to
have
the
power
of
directly
saying
any
thing
to
the
purpose.
She
could
only
give
him
a
look;
but
it
was
such
a
look
as
she
thought
must
restore
him
to
his
senses,
and
then
left
the
sofa,
removing
to
a
seat
by
her
sister,
and
giving
her
all
her
attention.
She
had
not
time
to
know
how
Mr.
Elton
took
the
reproof,
so
rapidly
did
another
subject
succeed;
for
Mr.
John
Knightley
now
came
into
the
room
from
examining
the
weather,
and
opened
on
them
all
with
the
information
of
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow,
and
of
its
still
snowing
fast,
with
a
strong
drifting
wind;
concluding
with
these
words
to
Mr.
Woodhouse:
"This
will
prove
a
