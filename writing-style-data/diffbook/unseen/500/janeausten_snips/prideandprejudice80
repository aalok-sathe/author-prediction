wife
of
Mr.
Collins
was
a
most
humiliating
picture!
And
to
the
pang
of
a
friend
disgracing
herself
and
sunk
in
her
esteem,
was
added
the
distressing
conviction
that
it
was
impossible
for
that
friend
to
be
tolerably
happy
in
the
lot
she
had
chosen.
Elizabeth
was
sitting
with
her
mother
and
sisters,
reflecting
on
what
she
had
heard,
and
doubting
whether
she
was
authorised
to
mention
it,
when
Sir
William
Lucas
himself
appeared,
sent
by
his
daughter,
to
announce
her
engagement
to
the
family.
With
many
compliments
to
them,
and
much
self
gratulation
on
the
prospect
of
a
connection
between
the
houses,
he
unfolded
the
matter
to
an
audience
not
merely
wondering,
but
incredulous;
for
Mrs.
Bennet,
with
more
perseverance
than
politeness,
protested
he
must
be
entirely
mistaken;
and
Lydia,
always
unguarded
and
often
uncivil,
boisterously
exclaimed:
"Good
Lord!
Sir
William,
how
can
you
tell
such
a
story?
Do
not
you
know
that
Mr.
Collins
wants
to
marry
Lizzy?"
Nothing
less
than
the
complaisance
of
a
courtier
could
have
borne
without
anger
such
treatment;
but
Sir
William's
good
breeding
carried
him
through
it
all;
and
though
he
begged
leave
to
be
positive
as
to
the
truth
of
his
information,
he
listened
to
all
their
impertinence
with
the
most
forbearing
courtesy.
Elizabeth,
feeling
it
incumbent
on
her
to
relieve
him
from
so
unpleasant
a
situation,
now
put
herself
forward
to
confirm
his
account,
by
mentioning
her
prior
knowledge
of
it
from
Charlotte
herself;
and
endeavoured
to
put
a
stop
to
the
exclamations
of
her
mother
and
sisters
by
the
earnestness
of
her
congratulations
to
Sir
William,
in
which
she
was
readily
joined
by
Jane,
and
by
making
a
variety
of
remarks
on
the
happiness
that
might
be
expected
from
the
match,
the
excellent
character
of
Mr.
Collins,
and
the
convenient
distance
of
Hunsford
from
London.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
in
fact
too
much
overpowered
to
say
a
great
deal
while
Sir
William
remained;
but
no
sooner
had
he
left
them
than
her
feelings
found
a
rapid
vent.
In
the
first
place,
she
persisted
in
disbelieving
the
whole
of
the
matter;
secondly,
she
was
very
sure
that
Mr.
Collins
had
been
taken
in;
thirdly,
she
trusted
that
they
would
never
be
happy
together;
and
fourthly,
that
the
match
might
be
broken
off.
Two
inferences,
however,
were
plainly
deduced
from
the
whole:
one,
that
Elizabeth
was
the
real
cause
of
the
mischief;
and
the
other
that
she
herself
had
been
barbarously
misused
by
them
all;
and
on
these
two
points
she
principally
dwelt
during
the
rest
of
the
day.
Nothing
could
console
and
nothing
could
appease
her.
Nor
did
that
day
wear
out
her
resentment.
A
week
elapsed
before
she
could
see
Elizabeth
without
scolding
her,
a
month
passed
away
before
she
could
speak
to
Sir
William
or
Lady
Lucas
without
being
rude,
and
many
months
were
gone
before
she
could
at
all
forgive
their
daughter.
Mr.
Bennet's
emotions
were
much
more
tranquil
on
the
occasion,
and
such
as
he
did
experience
he
