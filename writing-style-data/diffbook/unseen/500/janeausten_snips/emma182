assure
you
it
has
been
the
greatest
satisfaction,
comfort,
and
delight
to
me,
to
hear
what
a
musical
society
I
am
got
into.
I
absolutely
cannot
do
without
music.
It
is
a
necessary
of
life
to
me;
and
having
always
been
used
to
a
very
musical
society,
both
at
Maple
Grove
and
in
Bath,
it
would
have
been
a
most
serious
sacrifice.
I
honestly
said
as
much
to
Mr.
E.
when
he
was
speaking
of
my
future
home,
and
expressing
his
fears
lest
the
retirement
of
it
should
be
disagreeable;
and
the
inferiority
of
the
house
too
knowing
what
I
had
been
accustomed
to
of
course
he
was
not
wholly
without
apprehension.
When
he
was
speaking
of
it
in
that
way,
I
honestly
said
that
the
world
I
could
give
up
parties,
balls,
plays
for
I
had
no
fear
of
retirement.
Blessed
with
so
many
resources
within
myself,
the
world
was
not
necessary
to
me.
I
could
do
very
well
without
it.
To
those
who
had
no
resources
it
was
a
different
thing;
but
my
resources
made
me
quite
independent.
And
as
to
smaller
sized
rooms
than
I
had
been
used
to,
I
really
could
not
give
it
a
thought.
I
hoped
I
was
perfectly
equal
to
any
sacrifice
of
that
description.
Certainly
I
had
been
accustomed
to
every
luxury
at
Maple
Grove;
but
I
did
assure
him
that
two
carriages
were
not
necessary
to
my
happiness,
nor
were
spacious
apartments.
'But,'
said
I,
'to
be
quite
honest,
I
do
not
think
I
can
live
without
something
of
a
musical
society.
I
condition
for
nothing
else;
but
without
music,
life
would
be
a
blank
to
me.'"
"We
cannot
suppose,"
said
Emma,
smiling,
"that
Mr.
Elton
would
hesitate
to
assure
you
of
there
being
a
very
musical
society
in
Highbury;
and
I
hope
you
will
not
find
he
has
outstepped
the
truth
more
than
may
be
pardoned,
in
consideration
of
the
motive."
"No,
indeed,
I
have
no
doubts
at
all
on
that
head.
I
am
delighted
to
find
myself
in
such
a
circle.
I
hope
we
shall
have
many
sweet
little
concerts
together.
I
think,
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
and
I
must
establish
a
musical
club,
and
have
regular
weekly
meetings
at
your
house,
or
ours.
Will
not
it
be
a
good
plan?
If
we
exert
ourselves,
I
think
we
shall
not
be
long
in
want
of
allies.
Something
of
that
nature
would
be
particularly
desirable
for
me,
as
an
inducement
to
keep
me
in
practice;
for
married
women,
you
know
there
is
a
sad
story
against
them,
in
general.
They
are
but
too
apt
to
give
up
music."
"But
you,
who
are
so
extremely
fond
of
it
there
can
be
no
danger,
surely?"
"I
should
hope
not;
but
really
when
I
look
around
among
my
acquaintance,
I
tremble.
Selina
has
entirely
given
up
music
never
touches
the
instrument
though
she
played
sweetly.
And
the
same
may
be
said
of
Mrs.
Jeffereys
Clara
Partridge,
that
was
and
of
the
two
Milmans,
