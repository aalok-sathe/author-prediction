replete
with
advantage,
so
promising
for
happiness,
Jane
had
been
deprived,
by
the
folly
and
indecorum
of
her
own
family!
When
to
these
recollections
was
added
the
development
of
Wickham's
character,
it
may
be
easily
believed
that
the
happy
spirits
which
had
seldom
been
depressed
before,
were
now
so
much
affected
as
to
make
it
almost
impossible
for
her
to
appear
tolerably
cheerful.
Their
engagements
at
Rosings
were
as
frequent
during
the
last
week
of
her
stay
as
they
had
been
at
first.
The
very
last
evening
was
spent
there;
and
her
ladyship
again
inquired
minutely
into
the
particulars
of
their
journey,
gave
them
directions
as
to
the
best
method
of
packing,
and
was
so
urgent
on
the
necessity
of
placing
gowns
in
the
only
right
way,
that
Maria
thought
herself
obliged,
on
her
return,
to
undo
all
the
work
of
the
morning,
and
pack
her
trunk
afresh.
When
they
parted,
Lady
Catherine,
with
great
condescension,
wished
them
a
good
journey,
and
invited
them
to
come
to
Hunsford
again
next
year;
and
Miss
de
Bourgh
exerted
herself
so
far
as
to
curtsey
and
hold
out
her
hand
to
both.
On
Saturday
morning
Elizabeth
and
Mr.
Collins
met
for
breakfast
a
few
minutes
before
the
others
appeared;
and
he
took
the
opportunity
of
paying
the
parting
civilities
which
he
deemed
indispensably
necessary.
"I
know
not,
Miss
Elizabeth,"
said
he,
"whether
Mrs.
Collins
has
yet
expressed
her
sense
of
your
kindness
in
coming
to
us;
but
I
am
very
certain
you
will
not
leave
the
house
without
receiving
her
thanks
for
it.
The
favour
of
your
company
has
been
much
felt,
I
assure
you.
We
know
how
little
there
is
to
tempt
anyone
to
our
humble
abode.
Our
plain
manner
of
living,
our
small
rooms
and
few
domestics,
and
the
little
we
see
of
the
world,
must
make
Hunsford
extremely
dull
to
a
young
lady
like
yourself;
but
I
hope
you
will
believe
us
grateful
for
the
condescension,
and
that
we
have
done
everything
in
our
power
to
prevent
your
spending
your
time
unpleasantly."
Elizabeth
was
eager
with
her
thanks
and
assurances
of
happiness.
She
had
spent
six
weeks
with
great
enjoyment;
and
the
pleasure
of
being
with
Charlotte,
and
the
kind
attentions
she
had
received,
must
make
her
feel
the
obliged.
Mr.
Collins
was
gratified,
and
with
a
more
smiling
solemnity
replied:
"It
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
hear
that
you
have
passed
your
time
not
disagreeably.
We
have
certainly
done
our
best;
and
most
fortunately
having
it
in
our
power
to
introduce
you
to
very
superior
society,
and,
from
our
connection
with
Rosings,
the
frequent
means
of
varying
the
humble
home
scene,
I
think
we
may
flatter
ourselves
that
your
Hunsford
visit
cannot
have
been
entirely
irksome.
Our
situation
with
regard
to
Lady
Catherine's
family
is
indeed
the
sort
of
extraordinary
advantage
and
blessing
which
few
can
boast.
You
see
on
what
a
footing
we
are.
You
see
how
continually
we
are
engaged
there.
In
truth
I
must
acknowledge
that,
