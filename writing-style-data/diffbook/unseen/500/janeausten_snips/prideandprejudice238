his
good
qualities,
she
did
conquer
her
father's
incredulity,
and
reconcile
him
to
the
match.
"Well,
my
dear,"
said
he,
when
she
ceased
speaking,
"I
have
no
more
to
say.
If
this
be
the
case,
he
deserves
you.
I
could
not
have
parted
with
you,
my
Lizzy,
to
anyone
less
worthy."
To
complete
the
favourable
impression,
she
then
told
him
what
Mr.
Darcy
had
voluntarily
done
for
Lydia.
He
heard
her
with
astonishment.
"This
is
an
evening
of
wonders,
indeed!
And
so,
Darcy
did
every
thing;
made
up
the
match,
gave
the
money,
paid
the
fellow's
debts,
and
got
him
his
commission!
So
much
the
better.
It
will
save
me
a
world
of
trouble
and
economy.
Had
it
been
your
uncle's
doing,
I
must
and
would
have
paid
him;
but
these
violent
young
lovers
carry
every
thing
their
own
way.
I
shall
offer
to
pay
him
to
morrow;
he
will
rant
and
storm
about
his
love
for
you,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter."
He
then
recollected
her
embarrassment
a
few
days
before,
on
his
reading
Mr.
Collins's
letter;
and
after
laughing
at
her
some
time,
allowed
her
at
last
to
go
saying,
as
she
quitted
the
room,
"If
any
young
men
come
for
Mary
or
Kitty,
send
them
in,
for
I
am
quite
at
leisure."
Elizabeth's
mind
was
now
relieved
from
a
very
heavy
weight;
and,
after
half
an
hour's
quiet
reflection
in
her
own
room,
she
was
able
to
join
the
others
with
tolerable
composure.
Every
thing
was
too
recent
for
gaiety,
but
the
evening
passed
tranquilly
away;
there
was
no
longer
anything
material
to
be
dreaded,
and
the
comfort
of
ease
and
familiarity
would
come
in
time.
When
her
mother
went
up
to
her
dressing
room
at
night,
she
followed
her,
and
made
the
important
communication.
Its
effect
was
most
extraordinary;
for
on
first
hearing
it,
Mrs.
Bennet
sat
quite
still,
and
unable
to
utter
a
syllable.
Nor
was
it
under
many,
many
minutes
that
she
could
comprehend
what
she
heard;
though
not
in
general
backward
to
credit
what
was
for
the
advantage
of
her
family,
or
that
came
in
the
shape
of
a
lover
to
any
of
them.
She
began
at
length
to
recover,
to
fidget
about
in
her
chair,
get
up,
sit
down
again,
wonder,
and
bless
herself.
"Good
gracious!
Lord
bless
me!
only
think!
dear
me!
Mr.
Darcy!
Who
would
have
thought
it!
And
is
it
really
true?
Oh!
my
sweetest
Lizzy!
how
rich
and
how
great
you
will
be!
What
pin
money,
what
jewels,
what
carriages
you
will
have!
Jane's
is
nothing
to
it
nothing
at
all.
I
am
so
pleased
so
happy.
Such
a
charming
man!
so
handsome!
so
tall!
Oh,
my
dear
Lizzy!
pray
apologise
for
my
having
disliked
him
so
much
before.
I
hope
he
will
overlook
it.
Dear,
dear
Lizzy.
A
house
in
town!
Every
thing
that
is
charming!
Three
daughters
married!
Ten
thousand
a
year!
Oh,
Lord!
What
will
become
of
me.
I
shall
go
