to
have
her
removed
just
now
for
a
time
from
Highbury,
and
indulging
in
one
scheme
more
nearly
resolve,
that
it
might
be
practicable
to
get
an
invitation
for
her
to
Brunswick
Square.
Isabella
had
been
pleased
with
Harriet;
and
a
few
weeks
spent
in
London
must
give
her
some
amusement.
She
did
not
think
it
in
Harriet's
nature
to
escape
being
benefited
by
novelty
and
variety,
by
the
streets,
the
shops,
and
the
children.
At
any
rate,
it
would
be
a
proof
of
attention
and
kindness
in
herself,
from
whom
every
thing
was
due;
a
separation
for
the
present;
an
averting
of
the
evil
day,
when
they
must
all
be
together
again.
She
rose
early,
and
wrote
her
letter
to
Harriet;
an
employment
which
left
her
so
very
serious,
so
nearly
sad,
that
Mr.
Knightley,
in
walking
up
to
Hartfield
to
breakfast,
did
not
arrive
at
all
too
soon;
and
half
an
hour
stolen
afterwards
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
with
him,
literally
and
figuratively,
was
quite
necessary
to
reinstate
her
in
a
proper
share
of
the
happiness
of
the
evening
before.
He
had
not
left
her
long,
by
no
means
long
enough
for
her
to
have
the
slightest
inclination
for
thinking
of
any
body
else,
when
a
letter
was
brought
her
from
Randalls
a
very
thick
letter;
she
guessed
what
it
must
contain,
and
deprecated
the
necessity
of
reading
it.
She
was
now
in
perfect
charity
with
Frank
Churchill;
she
wanted
no
explanations,
she
wanted
only
to
have
her
thoughts
to
herself
and
as
for
understanding
any
thing
he
wrote,
she
was
sure
she
was
incapable
of
it.
It
must
be
waded
through,
however.
She
opened
the
packet;
it
was
too
surely
so;
a
note
from
Mrs.
Weston
to
herself,
ushered
in
the
letter
from
Frank
to
Mrs.
Weston.
"I
have
the
greatest
pleasure,
my
dear
Emma,
in
forwarding
to
you
the
enclosed.
I
know
what
thorough
justice
you
will
do
it,
and
have
scarcely
a
doubt
of
its
happy
effect.
I
think
we
shall
never
materially
disagree
about
the
writer
again;
but
I
will
not
delay
you
by
a
long
preface.
We
are
quite
well.
This
letter
has
been
the
cure
of
all
the
little
nervousness
I
have
been
feeling
lately.
I
did
not
quite
like
your
looks
on
Tuesday,
but
it
was
an
ungenial
morning;
and
though
you
will
never
own
being
affected
by
weather,
I
think
every
body
feels
a
north
east
wind.
I
felt
for
your
dear
father
very
much
in
the
storm
of
Tuesday
afternoon
and
yesterday
morning,
but
had
the
comfort
of
hearing
last
night,
by
Mr.
Perry,
that
it
had
not
made
him
ill.
"Yours
ever,
"A.
W."
[To
Mrs.
Weston.]
WINDSOR
JULY.
MY
DEAR
MADAM,
"If
I
made
myself
intelligible
yesterday,
this
letter
will
be
expected;
but
expected
or
not,
I
know
it
will
be
read
with
candour
and
indulgence.
You
are
all
goodness,
and
I
believe
there
will
be
need
of
even
all
your
goodness
to
allow
