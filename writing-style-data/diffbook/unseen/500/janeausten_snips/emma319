might
have
been
some
amusement
to
myself
in
the
same
situation.
I
think
there
is
a
little
likeness
between
us."
He
bowed.
"If
not
in
our
dispositions,"
she
presently
added,
with
a
look
of
true
sensibility,
"there
is
a
likeness
in
our
destiny;
the
destiny
which
bids
fair
to
connect
us
with
two
characters
so
much
superior
to
our
own."
"True,
true,"
he
answered,
warmly.
"No,
not
true
on
your
side.
You
can
have
no
superior,
but
most
true
on
mine.
She
is
a
complete
angel.
Look
at
her.
Is
not
she
an
angel
in
every
gesture?
Observe
the
turn
of
her
throat.
Observe
her
eyes,
as
she
is
looking
up
at
my
father.
You
will
be
glad
to
hear
(inclining
his
head,
and
whispering
seriously)
that
my
uncle
means
to
give
her
all
my
aunt's
jewels.
They
are
to
be
new
set.
I
am
resolved
to
have
some
in
an
ornament
for
the
head.
Will
not
it
be
beautiful
in
her
dark
hair?"
"Very
beautiful,
indeed,"
replied
Emma;
and
she
spoke
so
kindly,
that
he
gratefully
burst
out,
"How
delighted
I
am
to
see
you
again!
and
to
see
you
in
such
excellent
looks!
I
would
not
have
missed
this
meeting
for
the
world.
I
should
certainly
have
called
at
Hartfield,
had
you
failed
to
come."
The
others
had
been
talking
of
the
child,
Mrs.
Weston
giving
an
account
of
a
little
alarm
she
had
been
under,
the
evening
before,
from
the
infant's
appearing
not
quite
well.
She
believed
she
had
been
foolish,
but
it
had
alarmed
her,
and
she
had
been
within
half
a
minute
of
sending
for
Mr.
Perry.
Perhaps
she
ought
to
be
ashamed,
but
Mr.
Weston
had
been
almost
as
uneasy
as
herself.
In
ten
minutes,
however,
the
child
had
been
perfectly
well
again.
This
was
her
history;
and
particularly
interesting
it
was
to
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
commended
her
very
much
for
thinking
of
sending
for
Perry,
and
only
regretted
that
she
had
not
done
it.
"She
should
always
send
for
Perry,
if
the
child
appeared
in
the
slightest
degree
disordered,
were
it
only
for
a
moment.
She
could
not
be
too
soon
alarmed,
nor
send
for
Perry
too
often.
It
was
a
pity,
perhaps,
that
he
had
not
come
last
night;
for,
though
the
child
seemed
well
now,
very
well
considering,
it
would
probably
have
been
better
if
Perry
had
seen
it."
Frank
Churchill
caught
the
name.
"Perry!"
said
he
to
Emma,
and
trying,
as
he
spoke,
to
catch
Miss
Fairfax's
eye.
"My
friend
Mr.
Perry!
What
are
they
saying
about
Mr.
Perry?
Has
he
been
here
this
morning?
And
how
does
he
travel
now?
Has
he
set
up
his
carriage?"
Emma
soon
recollected,
and
understood
him;
and
while
she
joined
in
the
laugh,
it
was
evident
from
Jane's
countenance
that
she
too
was
really
hearing
him,
though
trying
to
seem
deaf.
"Such
an
extraordinary
dream
of
mine!"
he
cried.
"I
can
never
think
of
it
without
laughing.
She
hears
us,
she
hears
us,
