benefited
by
it.
She
wanted
to
hear
of
him,
when
there
seemed
the
least
chance
of
gaining
intelligence.
She
was
convinced
that
she
could
have
been
happy
with
him,
when
it
was
no
longer
likely
they
should
meet.
What
a
triumph
for
him,
as
she
often
thought,
could
he
know
that
the
proposals
which
she
had
proudly
spurned
only
four
months
ago,
would
now
have
been
most
gladly
and
gratefully
received!
He
was
as
generous,
she
doubted
not,
as
the
most
generous
of
his
sex;
but
while
he
was
mortal,
there
must
be
a
triumph.
She
began
now
to
comprehend
that
he
was
exactly
the
man
who,
in
disposition
and
talents,
would
most
suit
her.
His
understanding
and
temper,
though
unlike
her
own,
would
have
answered
all
her
wishes.
It
was
an
union
that
must
have
been
to
the
advantage
of
both;
by
her
ease
and
liveliness,
his
mind
might
have
been
softened,
his
manners
improved;
and
from
his
judgement,
information,
and
knowledge
of
the
world,
she
must
have
received
benefit
of
greater
importance.
But
no
such
happy
marriage
could
now
teach
the
admiring
multitude
what
connubial
felicity
really
was.
An
union
of
a
different
tendency,
and
precluding
the
possibility
of
the
other,
was
soon
to
be
formed
in
their
family.
How
Wickham
and
Lydia
were
to
be
supported
in
tolerable
independence,
she
could
not
imagine.
But
how
little
of
permanent
happiness
could
belong
to
a
couple
who
were
only
brought
together
because
their
passions
were
stronger
than
their
virtue,
she
could
easily
conjecture.
Mr.
Gardiner
soon
wrote
again
to
his
brother.
To
Mr.
Bennet's
acknowledgments
he
briefly
replied,
with
assurance
of
his
eagerness
to
promote
the
welfare
of
any
of
his
family;
and
concluded
with
entreaties
that
the
subject
might
never
be
mentioned
to
him
again.
The
principal
purport
of
his
letter
was
to
inform
them
that
Mr.
Wickham
had
resolved
on
quitting
the
militia.
"It
was
greatly
my
wish
that
he
should
do
so,"
he
added,
"as
soon
as
his
marriage
was
fixed
on.
And
I
think
you
will
agree
with
me,
in
considering
the
removal
from
that
corps
as
highly
advisable,
both
on
his
account
and
my
niece's.
It
is
Mr.
Wickham's
intention
to
go
into
the
regulars;
and
among
his
former
friends,
there
are
still
some
who
are
able
and
willing
to
assist
him
in
the
army.
He
has
the
promise
of
an
ensigncy
in
General
's
regiment,
now
quartered
in
the
North.
It
is
an
advantage
to
have
it
so
far
from
this
part
of
the
kingdom.
He
promises
fairly;
and
I
hope
among
different
people,
where
they
may
each
have
a
character
to
preserve,
they
will
both
be
more
prudent.
I
have
written
to
Colonel
Forster,
to
inform
him
of
our
present
arrangements,
and
to
request
that
he
will
satisfy
the
various
creditors
of
Mr.
Wickham
in
and
near
Brighton,
with
assurances
of
speedy
payment,
for
which
I
have
pledged
myself.
And
will
you
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
carrying
similar
assurances
to
his
