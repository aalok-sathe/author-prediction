cousin
to
give
her
opinion
of
all
that
she
had
seen
at
Rosings,
which,
for
Charlotte's
sake,
she
made
more
favourable
than
it
really
was.
But
her
commendation,
though
costing
her
some
trouble,
could
by
no
means
satisfy
Mr.
Collins,
and
he
was
very
soon
obliged
to
take
her
ladyship's
praise
into
his
own
hands.
Sir
William
stayed
only
a
week
at
Hunsford,
but
his
visit
was
long
enough
to
convince
him
of
his
daughter's
being
most
comfortably
settled,
and
of
her
possessing
such
a
husband
and
such
a
neighbour
as
were
not
often
met
with.
While
Sir
William
was
with
them,
Mr.
Collins
devoted
his
morning
to
driving
him
out
in
his
gig,
and
showing
him
the
country;
but
when
he
went
away,
the
whole
family
returned
to
their
usual
employments,
and
Elizabeth
was
thankful
to
find
that
they
did
not
see
more
of
her
cousin
by
the
alteration,
for
the
chief
of
the
time
between
breakfast
and
dinner
was
now
passed
by
him
either
at
work
in
the
garden
or
in
reading
and
writing,
and
looking
out
of
the
window
in
his
own
book
room,
which
fronted
the
road.
The
room
in
which
the
ladies
sat
was
backwards.
Elizabeth
had
at
first
rather
wondered
that
Charlotte
should
not
prefer
the
dining
parlour
for
common
use;
it
was
a
better
sized
room,
and
had
a
more
pleasant
aspect;
but
she
soon
saw
that
her
friend
had
an
excellent
reason
for
what
she
did,
for
Mr.
Collins
would
undoubtedly
have
been
much
less
in
his
own
apartment,
had
they
sat
in
one
equally
lively;
and
she
gave
Charlotte
credit
for
the
arrangement.
From
the
drawing
room
they
could
distinguish
nothing
in
the
lane,
and
were
indebted
to
Mr.
Collins
for
the
knowledge
of
what
carriages
went
along,
and
how
often
especially
Miss
de
Bourgh
drove
by
in
her
phaeton,
which
he
never
failed
coming
to
inform
them
of,
though
it
happened
almost
every
day.
She
not
unfrequently
stopped
at
the
Parsonage,
and
had
a
few
minutes'
conversation
with
Charlotte,
but
was
scarcely
ever
prevailed
upon
to
get
out.
Very
few
days
passed
in
which
Mr.
Collins
did
not
walk
to
Rosings,
and
not
many
in
which
his
wife
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
go
likewise;
and
till
Elizabeth
recollected
that
there
might
be
other
family
livings
to
be
disposed
of,
she
could
not
understand
the
sacrifice
of
so
many
hours.
Now
and
then
they
were
honoured
with
a
call
from
her
ladyship,
and
nothing
escaped
her
observation
that
was
passing
in
the
room
during
these
visits.
She
examined
into
their
employments,
looked
at
their
work,
and
advised
them
to
do
it
differently;
found
fault
with
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture;
or
detected
the
housemaid
in
negligence;
and
if
she
accepted
any
refreshment,
seemed
to
do
it
only
for
the
sake
of
finding
out
that
Mrs.
Collins's
joints
of
meat
were
too
large
for
her
family.
Elizabeth
soon
perceived,
that
though
this
great
lady
was
not
in
commission
of
the
