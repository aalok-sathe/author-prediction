call
for
more
than
a
word
in
passing.
"I
perfectly
agree
with
you,
sir,"
was
then
his
remark.
"You
did
behave
very
shamefully.
You
never
wrote
a
truer
line."
And
having
gone
through
what
immediately
followed
of
the
basis
of
their
disagreement,
and
his
persisting
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
Jane
Fairfax's
sense
of
right,
he
made
a
fuller
pause
to
say,
"This
is
very
bad.
He
had
induced
her
to
place
herself,
for
his
sake,
in
a
situation
of
extreme
difficulty
and
uneasiness,
and
it
should
have
been
his
first
object
to
prevent
her
from
suffering
unnecessarily.
She
must
have
had
much
more
to
contend
with,
in
carrying
on
the
correspondence,
than
he
could.
He
should
have
respected
even
unreasonable
scruples,
had
there
been
such;
but
hers
were
all
reasonable.
We
must
look
to
her
one
fault,
and
remember
that
she
had
done
a
wrong
thing
in
consenting
to
the
engagement,
to
bear
that
she
should
have
been
in
such
a
state
of
punishment."
Emma
knew
that
he
was
now
getting
to
the
Box
Hill
party,
and
grew
uncomfortable.
Her
own
behaviour
had
been
so
very
improper!
She
was
deeply
ashamed,
and
a
little
afraid
of
his
next
look.
It
was
all
read,
however,
steadily,
attentively,
and
without
the
smallest
remark;
and,
excepting
one
momentary
glance
at
her,
instantly
withdrawn,
in
the
fear
of
giving
pain
no
remembrance
of
Box
Hill
seemed
to
exist.
"There
is
no
saying
much
for
the
delicacy
of
our
good
friends,
the
Eltons,"
was
his
next
observation.
"His
feelings
are
natural.
What!
actually
resolve
to
break
with
him
entirely!
She
felt
the
engagement
to
be
a
source
of
repentance
and
misery
to
each
she
dissolved
it.
What
a
view
this
gives
of
her
sense
of
his
behaviour!
Well,
he
must
be
a
most
extraordinary
"
"Nay,
nay,
read
on.
You
will
find
how
very
much
he
suffers."
"I
hope
he
does,"
replied
Mr.
Knightley
coolly,
and
resuming
the
letter.
"'Smallridge!'
What
does
this
mean?
What
is
all
this?"
"She
had
engaged
to
go
as
governess
to
Mrs.
Smallridge's
children
a
dear
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton's
a
neighbour
of
Maple
Grove;
and,
by
the
bye,
I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Elton
bears
the
disappointment?"
"Say
nothing,
my
dear
Emma,
while
you
oblige
me
to
read
not
even
of
Mrs.
Elton.
Only
one
page
more.
I
shall
soon
have
done.
What
a
letter
the
man
writes!"
"I
wish
you
would
read
it
with
a
kinder
spirit
towards
him."
"Well,
there
is
feeling
here.
He
does
seem
to
have
suffered
in
finding
her
ill.
Certainly,
I
can
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
fond
of
her.
'Dearer,
much
dearer
than
ever.'
I
hope
he
may
long
continue
to
feel
all
the
value
of
such
a
reconciliation.
He
is
a
very
liberal
thanker,
with
his
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands.
'Happier
than
I
deserve.'
Come,
he
knows
himself
there.
'Miss
Woodhouse
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune.'
Those
were
Miss
Woodhouse's
words,
were
they?
And
a
fine
