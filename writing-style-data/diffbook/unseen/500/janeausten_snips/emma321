hers,
and
decent
enough
to
have
always
wished
for
concealment.
Such
was
the
blood
of
gentility
which
Emma
had
formerly
been
so
ready
to
vouch
for!
It
was
likely
to
be
as
untainted,
perhaps,
as
the
blood
of
many
a
gentleman:
but
what
a
connexion
had
she
been
preparing
for
Mr.
Knightley
or
for
the
Churchills
or
even
for
Mr.
Elton!
The
stain
of
illegitimacy,
unbleached
by
nobility
or
wealth,
would
have
been
a
stain
indeed.
No
objection
was
raised
on
the
father's
side;
the
young
man
was
treated
liberally;
it
was
all
as
it
should
be:
and
as
Emma
became
acquainted
with
Robert
Martin,
who
was
now
introduced
at
Hartfield,
she
fully
acknowledged
in
him
all
the
appearance
of
sense
and
worth
which
could
bid
fairest
for
her
little
friend.
She
had
no
doubt
of
Harriet's
happiness
with
any
good
tempered
man;
but
with
him,
and
in
the
home
he
offered,
there
would
be
the
hope
of
more,
of
security,
stability,
and
improvement.
She
would
be
placed
in
the
midst
of
those
who
loved
her,
and
who
had
better
sense
than
herself;
retired
enough
for
safety,
and
occupied
enough
for
cheerfulness.
She
would
be
never
led
into
temptation,
nor
left
for
it
to
find
her
out.
She
would
be
respectable
and
happy;
and
Emma
admitted
her
to
be
the
luckiest
creature
in
the
world,
to
have
created
so
steady
and
persevering
an
affection
in
such
a
man;
or,
if
not
quite
the
luckiest,
to
yield
only
to
herself.
Harriet,
necessarily
drawn
away
by
her
engagements
with
the
Martins,
was
less
and
less
at
Hartfield;
which
was
not
to
be
regretted.
The
intimacy
between
her
and
Emma
must
sink;
their
friendship
must
change
into
a
calmer
sort
of
goodwill;
and,
fortunately,
what
ought
to
be,
and
must
be,
seemed
already
beginning,
and
in
the
most
gradual,
natural
manner.
Before
the
end
of
September,
Emma
attended
Harriet
to
church,
and
saw
her
hand
bestowed
on
Robert
Martin
with
so
complete
a
satisfaction,
as
no
remembrances,
even
connected
with
Mr.
Elton
as
he
stood
before
them,
could
impair.
Perhaps,
indeed,
at
that
time
she
scarcely
saw
Mr.
Elton,
but
as
the
clergyman
whose
blessing
at
the
altar
might
next
fall
on
herself.
Robert
Martin
and
Harriet
Smith,
the
latest
couple
engaged
of
the
three,
were
the
first
to
be
married.
Jane
Fairfax
had
already
quitted
Highbury,
and
was
restored
to
the
comforts
of
her
beloved
home
with
the
Campbells.
The
Mr.
Churchills
were
also
in
town;
and
they
were
only
waiting
for
November.
The
intermediate
month
was
the
one
fixed
on,
as
far
as
they
dared,
by
Emma
and
Mr.
Knightley.
They
had
determined
that
their
marriage
ought
to
be
concluded
while
John
and
Isabella
were
still
at
Hartfield,
to
allow
them
the
fortnight's
absence
in
a
tour
to
the
seaside,
which
was
the
plan.
John
and
Isabella,
and
every
other
friend,
were
agreed
in
approving
it.
But
Mr.
Woodhouse
how
was
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
be
induced
to
consent?
he,
who
had
