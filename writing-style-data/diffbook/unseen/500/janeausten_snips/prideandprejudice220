me
so
happy,"
said
she,
one
evening,
"by
telling
me
that
he
was
totally
ignorant
of
my
being
in
town
last
spring!
I
had
not
believed
it
possible."
"I
suspected
as
much,"
replied
Elizabeth.
"But
how
did
he
account
for
it?"
"It
must
have
been
his
sister's
doing.
They
were
certainly
no
friends
to
his
acquaintance
with
me,
which
I
cannot
wonder
at,
since
he
might
have
chosen
so
much
more
advantageously
in
many
respects.
But
when
they
see,
as
I
trust
they
will,
that
their
brother
is
happy
with
me,
they
will
learn
to
be
contented,
and
we
shall
be
on
good
terms
again;
though
we
can
never
be
what
we
once
were
to
each
other."
"That
is
the
most
unforgiving
speech,"
said
Elizabeth,
"that
I
ever
heard
you
utter.
Good
girl!
It
would
vex
me,
indeed,
to
see
you
again
the
dupe
of
Miss
Bingley's
pretended
regard."
"Would
you
believe
it,
Lizzy,
that
when
he
went
to
town
last
November,
he
really
loved
me,
and
nothing
but
a
persuasion
of
my
being
indifferent
would
have
prevented
his
coming
down
again!"
"He
made
a
little
mistake
to
be
sure;
but
it
is
to
the
credit
of
his
modesty."
This
naturally
introduced
a
panegyric
from
Jane
on
his
diffidence,
and
the
little
value
he
put
on
his
own
good
qualities.
Elizabeth
was
pleased
to
find
that
he
had
not
betrayed
the
interference
of
his
friend;
for,
though
Jane
had
the
most
generous
and
forgiving
heart
in
the
world,
she
knew
it
was
a
circumstance
which
must
prejudice
her
against
him.
"I
am
certainly
the
most
fortunate
creature
that
ever
existed!"
cried
Jane.
"Oh!
Lizzy,
why
am
I
thus
singled
from
my
family,
and
blessed
above
them
all!
If
I
could
but
see
you
as
happy!
If
there
were
but
such
another
man
for
you!"
"If
you
were
to
give
me
forty
such
men,
I
never
could
be
so
happy
as
you.
Till
I
have
your
disposition,
your
goodness,
I
never
can
have
your
happiness.
No,
no,
let
me
shift
for
myself;
and,
perhaps,
if
I
have
very
good
luck,
I
may
meet
with
another
Mr.
Collins
in
time."
The
situation
of
affairs
in
the
Longbourn
family
could
not
be
long
a
secret.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
privileged
to
whisper
it
to
Mrs.
Phillips,
and
she
ventured,
without
any
permission,
to
do
the
same
by
all
her
neighbours
in
Meryton.
The
Bennets
were
speedily
pronounced
to
be
the
luckiest
family
in
the
world,
though
only
a
few
weeks
before,
when
Lydia
had
first
run
away,
they
had
been
generally
proved
to
be
marked
out
for
misfortune.
One
morning,
about
a
week
after
Bingley's
engagement
with
Jane
had
been
formed,
as
he
and
the
females
of
the
family
were
sitting
together
in
the
dining
room,
their
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
to
the
window,
by
the
sound
of
a
carriage;
and
they
perceived
a
chaise
and
four
driving
up
the
lawn.
It
was
too
early
in
the
morning
for
visitors,
and
besides,
the
equipage
