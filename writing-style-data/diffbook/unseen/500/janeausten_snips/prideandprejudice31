a
lively
Scotch
air;
and
soon
afterwards
Mr.
Darcy,
drawing
near
Elizabeth,
said
to
her:
"Do
not
you
feel
a
great
inclination,
Miss
Bennet,
to
seize
such
an
opportunity
of
dancing
a
reel?"
She
smiled,
but
made
no
answer.
He
repeated
the
question,
with
some
surprise
at
her
silence.
"Oh!"
said
she,
"I
heard
you
before,
but
I
could
not
immediately
determine
what
to
say
in
reply.
You
wanted
me,
I
know,
to
say
'Yes,'
that
you
might
have
the
pleasure
of
despising
my
taste;
but
I
always
delight
in
overthrowing
those
kind
of
schemes,
and
cheating
a
person
of
their
premeditated
contempt.
I
have,
therefore,
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
you,
that
I
do
not
want
to
dance
a
reel
at
all
and
now
despise
me
if
you
dare."
"Indeed
I
do
not
dare."
Elizabeth,
having
rather
expected
to
affront
him,
was
amazed
at
his
gallantry;
but
there
was
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
archness
in
her
manner
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
affront
anybody;
and
Darcy
had
never
been
so
bewitched
by
any
woman
as
he
was
by
her.
He
really
believed,
that
were
it
not
for
the
inferiority
of
her
connections,
he
should
be
in
some
danger.
Miss
Bingley
saw,
or
suspected
enough
to
be
jealous;
and
her
great
anxiety
for
the
recovery
of
her
dear
friend
Jane
received
some
assistance
from
her
desire
of
getting
rid
of
Elizabeth.
She
often
tried
to
provoke
Darcy
into
disliking
her
guest,
by
talking
of
their
supposed
marriage,
and
planning
his
happiness
in
such
an
alliance.
"I
hope,"
said
she,
as
they
were
walking
together
in
the
shrubbery
the
next
day,
"you
will
give
your
mother
in
law
a
few
hints,
when
this
desirable
event
takes
place,
as
to
the
advantage
of
holding
her
tongue;
and
if
you
can
compass
it,
do
cure
the
younger
girls
of
running
after
officers.
And,
if
I
may
mention
so
delicate
a
subject,
endeavour
to
check
that
little
something,
bordering
on
conceit
and
impertinence,
which
your
lady
possesses."
"Have
you
anything
else
to
propose
for
my
domestic
felicity?"
"Oh!
yes.
Do
let
the
portraits
of
your
uncle
and
aunt
Phillips
be
placed
in
the
gallery
at
Pemberley.
Put
them
next
to
your
great
uncle
the
judge.
They
are
in
the
same
profession,
you
know,
only
in
different
lines.
As
for
your
Elizabeth's
picture,
you
must
not
have
it
taken,
for
what
painter
could
do
justice
to
those
beautiful
eyes?"
"It
would
not
be
easy,
indeed,
to
catch
their
expression,
but
their
colour
and
shape,
and
the
eyelashes,
so
remarkably
fine,
might
be
copied."
At
that
moment
they
were
met
from
another
walk
by
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Elizabeth
herself.
"I
did
not
know
that
you
intended
to
walk,"
said
Miss
Bingley,
in
some
confusion,
lest
they
had
been
overheard.
"You
used
us
abominably
ill,"
answered
Mrs.
Hurst,
"running
away
without
telling
us
that
you
were
coming
out."
Then
taking
the
disengaged
arm
of
Mr.
Darcy,
she
left
Elizabeth
to
walk
by
herself.
