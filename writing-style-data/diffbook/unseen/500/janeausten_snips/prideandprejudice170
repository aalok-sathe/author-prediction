him
here
soon.
Lydia
left
a
few
lines
for
his
wife,
informing
her
of
their
intention.
I
must
conclude,
for
I
cannot
be
long
from
my
poor
mother.
I
am
afraid
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
it
out,
but
I
hardly
know
what
I
have
written."
Without
allowing
herself
time
for
consideration,
and
scarcely
knowing
what
she
felt,
Elizabeth
on
finishing
this
letter
instantly
seized
the
other,
and
opening
it
with
the
utmost
impatience,
read
as
follows:
it
had
been
written
a
day
later
than
the
conclusion
of
the
first.
"By
this
time,
my
dearest
sister,
you
have
received
my
hurried
letter;
I
wish
this
may
be
more
intelligible,
but
though
not
confined
for
time,
my
head
is
so
bewildered
that
I
cannot
answer
for
being
coherent.
Dearest
Lizzy,
I
hardly
know
what
I
would
write,
but
I
have
bad
news
for
you,
and
it
cannot
be
delayed.
Imprudent
as
the
marriage
between
Mr.
Wickham
and
our
poor
Lydia
would
be,
we
are
now
anxious
to
be
assured
it
has
taken
place,
for
there
is
but
too
much
reason
to
fear
they
are
not
gone
to
Scotland.
Colonel
Forster
came
yesterday,
having
left
Brighton
the
day
before,
not
many
hours
after
the
express.
Though
Lydia's
short
letter
to
Mrs.
F.
gave
them
to
understand
that
they
were
going
to
Gretna
Green,
something
was
dropped
by
Denny
expressing
his
belief
that
W.
never
intended
to
go
there,
or
to
marry
Lydia
at
all,
which
was
repeated
to
Colonel
F.,
who,
instantly
taking
the
alarm,
set
off
from
B.
intending
to
trace
their
route.
He
did
trace
them
easily
to
Clapham,
but
no
further;
for
on
entering
that
place,
they
removed
into
a
hackney
coach,
and
dismissed
the
chaise
that
brought
them
from
Epsom.
All
that
is
known
after
this
is,
that
they
were
seen
to
continue
the
London
road.
I
know
not
what
to
think.
After
making
every
possible
inquiry
on
that
side
London,
Colonel
F.
came
on
into
Hertfordshire,
anxiously
renewing
them
at
all
the
turnpikes,
and
at
the
inns
in
Barnet
and
Hatfield,
but
without
any
success
no
such
people
had
been
seen
to
pass
through.
With
the
kindest
concern
he
came
on
to
Longbourn,
and
broke
his
apprehensions
to
us
in
a
manner
most
creditable
to
his
heart.
I
am
sincerely
grieved
for
him
and
Mrs.
F.,
but
no
one
can
throw
any
blame
on
them.
Our
distress,
my
dear
Lizzy,
is
very
great.
My
father
and
mother
believe
the
worst,
but
I
cannot
think
so
ill
of
him.
Many
circumstances
might
make
it
more
eligible
for
them
to
be
married
privately
in
town
than
to
pursue
their
first
plan;
and
even
if
he
could
form
such
a
design
against
a
young
woman
of
Lydia's
connections,
which
is
not
likely,
can
I
suppose
her
so
lost
to
everything?
Impossible!
I
grieve
to
find,
however,
that
Colonel
F.
is
not
disposed
to
depend
upon
their
marriage;
he
shook
his
head
when
I
expressed
my
hopes,
and
said
