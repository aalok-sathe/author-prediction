more
likely
to
want
more
time
than
courage,
Elizabeth.
But
it
ought
to
be
done,
and
if
you
will
give
me
a
sheet
of
paper,
it
shall
be
done
directly."
"And
if
I
had
not
a
letter
to
write
myself,
I
might
sit
by
you
and
admire
the
evenness
of
your
writing,
as
another
young
lady
once
did.
But
I
have
an
aunt,
too,
who
must
not
be
longer
neglected."
From
an
unwillingness
to
confess
how
much
her
intimacy
with
Mr.
Darcy
had
been
over
rated,
Elizabeth
had
never
yet
answered
Mrs.
Gardiner's
long
letter;
but
now,
having
that
to
communicate
which
she
knew
would
be
most
welcome,
she
was
almost
ashamed
to
find
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
had
already
lost
three
days
of
happiness,
and
immediately
wrote
as
follows:
"I
would
have
thanked
you
before,
my
dear
aunt,
as
I
ought
to
have
done,
for
your
long,
kind,
satisfactory,
detail
of
particulars;
but
to
say
the
truth,
I
was
too
cross
to
write.
You
supposed
more
than
really
existed.
But
now
suppose
as
much
as
you
choose;
give
a
loose
rein
to
your
fancy,
indulge
your
imagination
in
every
possible
flight
which
the
subject
will
afford,
and
unless
you
believe
me
actually
married,
you
cannot
greatly
err.
You
must
write
again
very
soon,
and
praise
him
a
great
deal
more
than
you
did
in
your
last.
I
thank
you,
again
and
again,
for
not
going
to
the
Lakes.
How
could
I
be
so
silly
as
to
wish
it!
Your
idea
of
the
ponies
is
delightful.
We
will
go
round
the
Park
every
day.
I
am
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world.
Perhaps
other
people
have
said
so
before,
but
not
one
with
such
justice.
I
am
happier
even
than
Jane;
she
only
smiles,
I
laugh.
Mr.
Darcy
sends
you
all
the
love
in
the
world
that
he
can
spare
from
me.
You
are
all
to
come
to
Pemberley
at
Christmas.
Yours,
etc."
Mr.
Darcy's
letter
to
Lady
Catherine
was
in
a
different
style;
and
still
different
from
either
was
what
Mr.
Bennet
sent
to
Mr.
Collins,
in
reply
to
his
last.
"DEAR
SIR,
"I
must
trouble
you
once
more
for
congratulations.
Elizabeth
will
soon
be
the
wife
of
Mr.
Darcy.
Console
Lady
Catherine
as
well
as
you
can.
But,
if
I
were
you,
I
would
stand
by
the
nephew.
He
has
more
to
give.
"Yours
sincerely,
etc."
Miss
Bingley's
congratulations
to
her
brother,
on
his
approaching
marriage,
were
all
that
was
affectionate
and
insincere.
She
wrote
even
to
Jane
on
the
occasion,
to
express
her
delight,
and
repeat
all
her
former
professions
of
regard.
Jane
was
not
deceived,
but
she
was
affected;
and
though
feeling
no
reliance
on
her,
could
not
help
writing
her
a
much
kinder
answer
than
she
knew
was
deserved.
The
joy
which
Miss
Darcy
expressed
on
receiving
similar
information,
was
as
sincere
as
her
brother's
in
sending
it.
Four
sides
of
paper
were
insufficient
to
contain
all
her
delight,
and
all
her
earnest
desire
