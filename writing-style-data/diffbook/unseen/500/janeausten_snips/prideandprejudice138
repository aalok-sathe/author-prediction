will
be
quite
an
old
maid
soon,
I
declare.
She
is
almost
three
and
twenty!
Lord,
how
ashamed
I
should
be
of
not
being
married
before
three
and
twenty!
My
aunt
Phillips
wants
you
so
to
get
husbands,
you
can't
think.
She
says
Lizzy
had
better
have
taken
Mr.
Collins;
but
I
do
not
think
there
would
have
been
any
fun
in
it.
Lord!
how
I
should
like
to
be
married
before
any
of
you;
and
then
I
would
chaperon
you
about
to
all
the
balls.
Dear
me!
we
had
such
a
good
piece
of
fun
the
other
day
at
Colonel
Forster's.
Kitty
and
me
were
to
spend
the
day
there,
and
Mrs.
Forster
promised
to
have
a
little
dance
in
the
evening;
(by
the
bye,
Mrs.
Forster
and
me
are
such
friends!)
and
so
she
asked
the
two
Harringtons
to
come,
but
Harriet
was
ill,
and
so
Pen
was
forced
to
come
by
herself;
and
then,
what
do
you
think
we
did?
We
dressed
up
Chamberlayne
in
woman's
clothes
on
purpose
to
pass
for
a
lady,
only
think
what
fun!
Not
a
soul
knew
of
it,
but
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Forster,
and
Kitty
and
me,
except
my
aunt,
for
we
were
forced
to
borrow
one
of
her
gowns;
and
you
cannot
imagine
how
well
he
looked!
When
Denny,
and
Wickham,
and
Pratt,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
men
came
in,
they
did
not
know
him
in
the
least.
Lord!
how
I
laughed!
and
so
did
Mrs.
Forster.
I
thought
I
should
have
died.
And
that
made
the
men
suspect
something,
and
then
they
soon
found
out
what
was
the
matter."
With
such
kinds
of
histories
of
their
parties
and
good
jokes,
did
Lydia,
assisted
by
Kitty's
hints
and
additions,
endeavour
to
amuse
her
companions
all
the
way
to
Longbourn.
Elizabeth
listened
as
little
as
she
could,
but
there
was
no
escaping
the
frequent
mention
of
Wickham's
name.
Their
reception
at
home
was
most
kind.
Mrs.
Bennet
rejoiced
to
see
Jane
in
undiminished
beauty;
and
more
than
once
during
dinner
did
Mr.
Bennet
say
voluntarily
to
Elizabeth:
"I
am
glad
you
are
come
back,
Lizzy."
Their
party
in
the
dining
room
was
large,
for
almost
all
the
Lucases
came
to
meet
Maria
and
hear
the
news;
and
various
were
the
subjects
that
occupied
them:
Lady
Lucas
was
inquiring
of
Maria,
after
the
welfare
and
poultry
of
her
eldest
daughter;
Mrs.
Bennet
was
doubly
engaged,
on
one
hand
collecting
an
account
of
the
present
fashions
from
Jane,
who
sat
some
way
below
her,
and,
on
the
other,
retailing
them
all
to
the
younger
Lucases;
and
Lydia,
in
a
voice
rather
louder
than
any
other
person's,
was
enumerating
the
various
pleasures
of
the
morning
to
anybody
who
would
hear
her.
"Oh!
Mary,"
said
she,
"I
wish
you
had
gone
with
us,
for
we
had
such
fun!
As
we
went
along,
Kitty
and
I
drew
up
the
blinds,
and
pretended
there
was
nobody
in
the
coach;
and
I
should
have
gone
