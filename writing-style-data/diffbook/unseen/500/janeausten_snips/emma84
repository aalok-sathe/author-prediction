to
any
thing
very
bad,
I
can
get
out
and
walk.
I
am
not
at
all
afraid.
I
should
not
mind
walking
half
the
way.
I
could
change
my
shoes,
you
know,
the
moment
I
got
home;
and
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
gives
me
cold."
"Indeed!"
replied
he.
"Then,
my
dear
Isabella,
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
sort
of
thing
in
the
world,
for
in
general
every
thing
does
give
you
cold.
Walk
home!
you
are
prettily
shod
for
walking
home,
I
dare
say.
It
will
be
bad
enough
for
the
horses."
Isabella
turned
to
Mrs.
Weston
for
her
approbation
of
the
plan.
Mrs.
Weston
could
only
approve.
Isabella
then
went
to
Emma;
but
Emma
could
not
so
entirely
give
up
the
hope
of
their
being
all
able
to
get
away;
and
they
were
still
discussing
the
point,
when
Mr.
Knightley,
who
had
left
the
room
immediately
after
his
brother's
first
report
of
the
snow,
came
back
again,
and
told
them
that
he
had
been
out
of
doors
to
examine,
and
could
answer
for
there
not
being
the
smallest
difficulty
in
their
getting
home,
whenever
they
liked
it,
either
now
or
an
hour
hence.
He
had
gone
beyond
the
sweep
some
way
along
the
Highbury
road
the
snow
was
nowhere
above
half
an
inch
deep
in
many
places
hardly
enough
to
whiten
the
ground;
a
very
few
flakes
were
falling
at
present,
but
the
clouds
were
parting,
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
its
being
soon
over.
He
had
seen
the
coachmen,
and
they
both
agreed
with
him
in
there
being
nothing
to
apprehend.
To
Isabella,
the
relief
of
such
tidings
was
very
great,
and
they
were
scarcely
less
acceptable
to
Emma
on
her
father's
account,
who
was
immediately
set
as
much
at
ease
on
the
subject
as
his
nervous
constitution
allowed;
but
the
alarm
that
had
been
raised
could
not
be
appeased
so
as
to
admit
of
any
comfort
for
him
while
he
continued
at
Randalls.
He
was
satisfied
of
there
being
no
present
danger
in
returning
home,
but
no
assurances
could
convince
him
that
it
was
safe
to
stay;
and
while
the
others
were
variously
urging
and
recommending,
Mr.
Knightley
and
Emma
settled
it
in
a
few
brief
sentences:
thus
"Your
father
will
not
be
easy;
why
do
not
you
go?"
"I
am
ready,
if
the
others
are."
"Shall
I
ring
the
bell?"
"Yes,
do."
And
the
bell
was
rung,
and
the
carriages
spoken
for.
A
few
minutes
more,
and
Emma
hoped
to
see
one
troublesome
companion
deposited
in
his
own
house,
to
get
sober
and
cool,
and
the
other
recover
his
temper
and
happiness
when
this
visit
of
hardship
were
over.
The
carriage
came:
and
Mr.
Woodhouse,
always
the
first
object
on
such
occasions,
was
carefully
attended
to
his
own
by
Mr.
Knightley
and
Mr.
Weston;
but
not
all
that
either
could
say
could
prevent
some
renewal
of
alarm
at
the
sight
of
the
snow
which
had
actually
fallen,
and
the
discovery
of
