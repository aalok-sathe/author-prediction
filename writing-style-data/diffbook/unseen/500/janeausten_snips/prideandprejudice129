there
renewed
a
slight
acquaintance.
Of
his
former
way
of
life
nothing
had
been
known
in
Hertfordshire
but
what
he
told
himself.
As
to
his
real
character,
had
information
been
in
her
power,
she
had
never
felt
a
wish
of
inquiring.
His
countenance,
voice,
and
manner
had
established
him
at
once
in
the
possession
of
every
virtue.
She
tried
to
recollect
some
instance
of
goodness,
some
distinguished
trait
of
integrity
or
benevolence,
that
might
rescue
him
from
the
attacks
of
Mr.
Darcy;
or
at
least,
by
the
predominance
of
virtue,
atone
for
those
casual
errors
under
which
she
would
endeavour
to
class
what
Mr.
Darcy
had
described
as
the
idleness
and
vice
of
many
years'
continuance.
But
no
such
recollection
befriended
her.
She
could
see
him
instantly
before
her,
in
every
charm
of
air
and
address;
but
she
could
remember
no
more
substantial
good
than
the
general
approbation
of
the
neighbourhood,
and
the
regard
which
his
social
powers
had
gained
him
in
the
mess.
After
pausing
on
this
point
a
considerable
while,
she
once
more
continued
to
read.
But,
alas!
the
story
which
followed,
of
his
designs
on
Miss
Darcy,
received
some
confirmation
from
what
had
passed
between
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
and
herself
only
the
morning
before;
and
at
last
she
was
referred
for
the
truth
of
every
particular
to
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
himself
from
whom
she
had
previously
received
the
information
of
his
near
concern
in
all
his
cousin's
affairs,
and
whose
character
she
had
no
reason
to
question.
At
one
time
she
had
almost
resolved
on
applying
to
him,
but
the
idea
was
checked
by
the
awkwardness
of
the
application,
and
at
length
wholly
banished
by
the
conviction
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
never
have
hazarded
such
a
proposal,
if
he
had
not
been
well
assured
of
his
cousin's
corroboration.
She
perfectly
remembered
everything
that
had
passed
in
conversation
between
Wickham
and
herself,
in
their
first
evening
at
Mr.
Phillips's.
Many
of
his
expressions
were
still
fresh
in
her
memory.
She
was
now
struck
with
the
impropriety
of
such
communications
to
a
stranger,
and
wondered
it
had
escaped
her
before.
She
saw
the
indelicacy
of
putting
himself
forward
as
he
had
done,
and
the
inconsistency
of
his
professions
with
his
conduct.
She
remembered
that
he
had
boasted
of
having
no
fear
of
seeing
Mr.
Darcy
that
Mr.
Darcy
might
leave
the
country,
but
that
he
should
stand
his
ground;
yet
he
had
avoided
the
Netherfield
ball
the
very
next
week.
She
remembered
also
that,
till
the
Netherfield
family
had
quitted
the
country,
he
had
told
his
story
to
no
one
but
herself;
but
that
after
their
removal
it
had
been
everywhere
discussed;
that
he
had
then
no
reserves,
no
scruples
in
sinking
Mr.
Darcy's
character,
though
he
had
assured
her
that
respect
for
the
father
would
always
prevent
his
exposing
the
son.
How
differently
did
everything
now
appear
in
which
he
was
concerned!
His
attentions
to
Miss
King
were
now
the
consequence
of
views
solely
and
hatefully
mercenary;
and
the
mediocrity
