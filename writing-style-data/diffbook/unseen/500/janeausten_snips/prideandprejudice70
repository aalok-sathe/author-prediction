go
directly
to
Mr.
Bennet,
and
we
shall
very
soon
settle
it
with
her,
I
am
sure."
She
would
not
give
him
time
to
reply,
but
hurrying
instantly
to
her
husband,
called
out
as
she
entered
the
library,
"Oh!
Mr.
Bennet,
you
are
wanted
immediately;
we
are
all
in
an
uproar.
You
must
come
and
make
Lizzy
marry
Mr.
Collins,
for
she
vows
she
will
not
have
him,
and
if
you
do
not
make
haste
he
will
change
his
mind
and
not
have
her."
Mr.
Bennet
raised
his
eyes
from
his
book
as
she
entered,
and
fixed
them
on
her
face
with
a
calm
unconcern
which
was
not
in
the
least
altered
by
her
communication.
"I
have
not
the
pleasure
of
understanding
you,"
said
he,
when
she
had
finished
her
speech.
"Of
what
are
you
talking?"
"Of
Mr.
Collins
and
Lizzy.
Lizzy
declares
she
will
not
have
Mr.
Collins,
and
Mr.
Collins
begins
to
say
that
he
will
not
have
Lizzy."
"And
what
am
I
to
do
on
the
occasion?
It
seems
an
hopeless
business."
"Speak
to
Lizzy
about
it
yourself.
Tell
her
that
you
insist
upon
her
marrying
him."
"Let
her
be
called
down.
She
shall
hear
my
opinion."
Mrs.
Bennet
rang
the
bell,
and
Miss
Elizabeth
was
summoned
to
the
library.
"Come
here,
child,"
cried
her
father
as
she
appeared.
"I
have
sent
for
you
on
an
affair
of
importance.
I
understand
that
Mr.
Collins
has
made
you
an
offer
of
marriage.
Is
it
true?"
Elizabeth
replied
that
it
was.
"Very
well
and
this
offer
of
marriage
you
have
refused?"
"I
have,
sir."
"Very
well.
We
now
come
to
the
point.
Your
mother
insists
upon
your
accepting
it.
Is
it
not
so,
Mrs.
Bennet?"
"Yes,
or
I
will
never
see
her
again."
"An
unhappy
alternative
is
before
you,
Elizabeth.
From
this
day
you
must
be
a
stranger
to
one
of
your
parents.
Your
mother
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
not
marry
Mr.
Collins,
and
I
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do."
Elizabeth
could
not
but
smile
at
such
a
conclusion
of
such
a
beginning,
but
Mrs.
Bennet,
who
had
persuaded
herself
that
her
husband
regarded
the
affair
as
she
wished,
was
excessively
disappointed.
"What
do
you
mean,
Mr.
Bennet,
in
talking
this
way?
You
promised
me
to
insist
upon
her
marrying
him."
"My
dear,"
replied
her
husband,
"I
have
two
small
favours
to
request.
First,
that
you
will
allow
me
the
free
use
of
my
understanding
on
the
present
occasion;
and
secondly,
of
my
room.
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
the
library
to
myself
as
soon
as
may
be."
Not
yet,
however,
in
spite
of
her
disappointment
in
her
husband,
did
Mrs.
Bennet
give
up
the
point.
She
talked
to
Elizabeth
again
and
again;
coaxed
and
threatened
her
by
turns.
She
endeavoured
to
secure
Jane
in
her
interest;
but
Jane,
with
all
possible
mildness,
declined
interfering;
and
Elizabeth,
sometimes
with
real
earnestness,
and
sometimes
with
playful
gaiety,
replied
to
her
attacks.
Though
