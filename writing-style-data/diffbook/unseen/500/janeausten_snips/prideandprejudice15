it
as
one
of
the
first
refinements
of
polished
society."
"Certainly,
sir;
and
it
has
the
advantage
also
of
being
in
vogue
amongst
the
less
polished
societies
of
the
world.
Every
savage
can
dance."
Sir
William
only
smiled.
"Your
friend
performs
delightfully,"
he
continued
after
a
pause,
on
seeing
Bingley
join
the
group;
"and
I
doubt
not
that
you
are
an
adept
in
the
science
yourself,
Mr.
Darcy."
"You
saw
me
dance
at
Meryton,
I
believe,
sir."
"Yes,
indeed,
and
received
no
inconsiderable
pleasure
from
the
sight.
Do
you
often
dance
at
St.
James's?"
"Never,
sir."
"Do
you
not
think
it
would
be
a
proper
compliment
to
the
place?"
"It
is
a
compliment
which
I
never
pay
to
any
place
if
I
can
avoid
it."
"You
have
a
house
in
town,
I
conclude?"
Mr.
Darcy
bowed.
"I
had
once
had
some
thought
of
fixing
in
town
myself
for
I
am
fond
of
superior
society;
but
I
did
not
feel
quite
certain
that
the
air
of
London
would
agree
with
Lady
Lucas."
He
paused
in
hopes
of
an
answer;
but
his
companion
was
not
disposed
to
make
any;
and
Elizabeth
at
that
instant
moving
towards
them,
he
was
struck
with
the
action
of
doing
a
very
gallant
thing,
and
called
out
to
her:
"My
dear
Miss
Eliza,
why
are
you
not
dancing?
Mr.
Darcy,
you
must
allow
me
to
present
this
young
lady
to
you
as
a
very
desirable
partner.
You
cannot
refuse
to
dance,
I
am
sure
when
so
much
beauty
is
before
you."
And,
taking
her
hand,
he
would
have
given
it
to
Mr.
Darcy
who,
though
extremely
surprised,
was
not
unwilling
to
receive
it,
when
she
instantly
drew
back,
and
said
with
some
discomposure
to
Sir
William:
"Indeed,
sir,
I
have
not
the
least
intention
of
dancing.
I
entreat
you
not
to
suppose
that
I
moved
this
way
in
order
to
beg
for
a
partner."
Mr.
Darcy,
with
grave
propriety,
requested
to
be
allowed
the
honour
of
her
hand,
but
in
vain.
Elizabeth
was
determined;
nor
did
Sir
William
at
all
shake
her
purpose
by
his
attempt
at
persuasion.
"You
excel
so
much
in
the
dance,
Miss
Eliza,
that
it
is
cruel
to
deny
me
the
happiness
of
seeing
you;
and
though
this
gentleman
dislikes
the
amusement
in
general,
he
can
have
no
objection,
I
am
sure,
to
oblige
us
for
one
half
hour."
"Mr.
Darcy
is
all
politeness,"
said
Elizabeth,
smiling.
"He
is,
indeed;
but,
considering
the
inducement,
my
dear
Miss
Eliza,
we
cannot
wonder
at
his
complaisance
for
who
would
object
to
such
a
partner?"
Elizabeth
looked
archly,
and
turned
away.
Her
resistance
had
not
injured
her
with
the
gentleman,
and
he
was
thinking
of
her
with
some
complacency,
when
thus
accosted
by
Miss
Bingley:
"I
can
guess
the
subject
of
your
reverie."
"I
should
imagine
not."
"You
are
considering
how
insupportable
it
would
be
to
pass
many
evenings
in
this
manner
in
such
society;
and
indeed
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion.
I
was
never
