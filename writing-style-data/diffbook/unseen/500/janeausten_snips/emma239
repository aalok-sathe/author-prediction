and
Emma
received
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say,
"These
are
my
own
concerns.
I
have
a
right
to
talk
on
such
subjects,
without
being
suspected
of
introducing
Robert
Martin."
She
did
not
suspect
him.
It
was
too
old
a
story.
Robert
Martin
had
probably
ceased
to
think
of
Harriet.
They
took
a
few
turns
together
along
the
walk.
The
shade
was
most
refreshing,
and
Emma
found
it
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
day.
The
next
remove
was
to
the
house;
they
must
all
go
in
and
eat;
and
they
were
all
seated
and
busy,
and
still
Frank
Churchill
did
not
come.
Mrs.
Weston
looked,
and
looked
in
vain.
His
father
would
not
own
himself
uneasy,
and
laughed
at
her
fears;
but
she
could
not
be
cured
of
wishing
that
he
would
part
with
his
black
mare.
He
had
expressed
himself
as
to
coming,
with
more
than
common
certainty.
"His
aunt
was
so
much
better,
that
he
had
not
a
doubt
of
getting
over
to
them."
Mrs.
Churchill's
state,
however,
as
many
were
ready
to
remind
her,
was
liable
to
such
sudden
variation
as
might
disappoint
her
nephew
in
the
most
reasonable
dependence
and
Mrs.
Weston
was
at
last
persuaded
to
believe,
or
to
say,
that
it
must
be
by
some
attack
of
Mrs.
Churchill
that
he
was
prevented
coming.
Emma
looked
at
Harriet
while
the
point
was
under
consideration;
she
behaved
very
well,
and
betrayed
no
emotion.
The
cold
repast
was
over,
and
the
party
were
to
go
out
once
more
to
see
what
had
not
yet
been
seen,
the
old
Abbey
fish
ponds;
perhaps
get
as
far
as
the
clover,
which
was
to
be
begun
cutting
on
the
morrow,
or,
at
any
rate,
have
the
pleasure
of
being
hot,
and
growing
cool
again.
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
had
already
taken
his
little
round
in
the
highest
part
of
the
gardens,
where
no
damps
from
the
river
were
imagined
even
by
him,
stirred
no
more;
and
his
daughter
resolved
to
remain
with
him,
that
Mrs.
Weston
might
be
persuaded
away
by
her
husband
to
the
exercise
and
variety
which
her
spirits
seemed
to
need.
Mr.
Knightley
had
done
all
in
his
power
for
Mr.
Woodhouse's
entertainment.
Books
of
engravings,
drawers
of
medals,
cameos,
corals,
shells,
and
every
other
family
collection
within
his
cabinets,
had
been
prepared
for
his
old
friend,
to
while
away
the
morning;
and
the
kindness
had
perfectly
answered.
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
exceedingly
well
amused.
Mrs.
Weston
had
been
shewing
them
all
to
him,
and
now
he
would
shew
them
all
to
Emma;
fortunate
in
having
no
other
resemblance
to
a
child,
than
in
a
total
want
of
taste
for
what
he
saw,
for
he
was
slow,
constant,
and
methodical.
Before
this
second
looking
over
was
begun,
however,
Emma
walked
into
the
hall
for
the
sake
of
a
few
moments'
free
observation
of
the
entrance
and
ground
plot
of
the
house
and
was
hardly
there,
when
Jane
Fairfax
appeared,
coming
quickly
in
from
the
garden,
and
with
