getting
on
faster
than
one
has
planned;
and
the
pleasure
of
coming
in
upon
one's
friends
before
the
look
out
begins,
is
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
any
little
exertion
it
needs."
"It
is
a
great
pleasure
where
one
can
indulge
in
it,"
said
the
young
man,
"though
there
are
not
many
houses
that
I
should
presume
on
so
far;
but
in
coming
home
I
felt
I
might
do
any
thing."
The
word
home
made
his
father
look
on
him
with
fresh
complacency.
Emma
was
directly
sure
that
he
knew
how
to
make
himself
agreeable;
the
conviction
was
strengthened
by
what
followed.
He
was
very
much
pleased
with
Randalls,
thought
it
a
most
admirably
arranged
house,
would
hardly
allow
it
even
to
be
very
small,
admired
the
situation,
the
walk
to
Highbury,
Highbury
itself,
Hartfield
still
more,
and
professed
himself
to
have
always
felt
the
sort
of
interest
in
the
country
which
none
but
one's
own
country
gives,
and
the
greatest
curiosity
to
visit
it.
That
he
should
never
have
been
able
to
indulge
so
amiable
a
feeling
before,
passed
suspiciously
through
Emma's
brain;
but
still,
if
it
were
a
falsehood,
it
was
a
pleasant
one,
and
pleasantly
handled.
His
manner
had
no
air
of
study
or
exaggeration.
He
did
really
look
and
speak
as
if
in
a
state
of
no
common
enjoyment.
Their
subjects
in
general
were
such
as
belong
to
an
opening
acquaintance.
On
his
side
were
the
inquiries,
"Was
she
a
horsewoman?
Pleasant
rides?
Pleasant
walks?
Had
they
a
large
neighbourhood?
Highbury,
perhaps,
afforded
society
enough?
There
were
several
very
pretty
houses
in
and
about
it.
Balls
had
they
balls?
Was
it
a
musical
society?"
But
when
satisfied
on
all
these
points,
and
their
acquaintance
proportionably
advanced,
he
contrived
to
find
an
opportunity,
while
their
two
fathers
were
engaged
with
each
other,
of
introducing
his
mother
in
law,
and
speaking
of
her
with
so
much
handsome
praise,
so
much
warm
admiration,
so
much
gratitude
for
the
happiness
she
secured
to
his
father,
and
her
very
kind
reception
of
himself,
as
was
an
additional
proof
of
his
knowing
how
to
please
and
of
his
certainly
thinking
it
worth
while
to
try
to
please
her.
He
did
not
advance
a
word
of
praise
beyond
what
she
knew
to
be
thoroughly
deserved
by
Mrs.
Weston;
but,
undoubtedly
he
could
know
very
little
of
the
matter.
He
understood
what
would
be
welcome;
he
could
be
sure
of
little
else.
"His
father's
marriage,"
he
said,
"had
been
the
wisest
measure,
every
friend
must
rejoice
in
it;
and
the
family
from
whom
he
had
received
such
a
blessing
must
be
ever
considered
as
having
conferred
the
highest
obligation
on
him."
He
got
as
near
as
he
could
to
thanking
her
for
Miss
Taylor's
merits,
without
seeming
quite
to
forget
that
in
the
common
course
of
things
it
was
to
be
rather
supposed
that
Miss
Taylor
had
formed
Miss
Woodhouse's
character,
than
Miss
Woodhouse
Miss
Taylor's.
And
at
last,
as
if
resolved
to
