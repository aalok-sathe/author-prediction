contained
little
else
than
that
they
were
just
returned
from
the
library,
where
such
and
such
officers
had
attended
them,
and
where
she
had
seen
such
beautiful
ornaments
as
made
her
quite
wild;
that
she
had
a
new
gown,
or
a
new
parasol,
which
she
would
have
described
more
fully,
but
was
obliged
to
leave
off
in
a
violent
hurry,
as
Mrs.
Forster
called
her,
and
they
were
going
off
to
the
camp;
and
from
her
correspondence
with
her
sister,
there
was
still
less
to
be
learnt
for
her
letters
to
Kitty,
though
rather
longer,
were
much
too
full
of
lines
under
the
words
to
be
made
public.
After
the
first
fortnight
or
three
weeks
of
her
absence,
health,
good
humour,
and
cheerfulness
began
to
reappear
at
Longbourn.
Everything
wore
a
happier
aspect.
The
families
who
had
been
in
town
for
the
winter
came
back
again,
and
summer
finery
and
summer
engagements
arose.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
restored
to
her
usual
querulous
serenity;
and,
by
the
middle
of
June,
Kitty
was
so
much
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
enter
Meryton
without
tears;
an
event
of
such
happy
promise
as
to
make
Elizabeth
hope
that
by
the
following
Christmas
she
might
be
so
tolerably
reasonable
as
not
to
mention
an
officer
above
once
a
day,
unless,
by
some
cruel
and
malicious
arrangement
at
the
War
Office,
another
regiment
should
be
quartered
in
Meryton.
The
time
fixed
for
the
beginning
of
their
northern
tour
was
now
fast
approaching,
and
a
fortnight
only
was
wanting
of
it,
when
a
letter
arrived
from
Mrs.
Gardiner,
which
at
once
delayed
its
commencement
and
curtailed
its
extent.
Mr.
Gardiner
would
be
prevented
by
business
from
setting
out
till
a
fortnight
later
in
July,
and
must
be
in
London
again
within
a
month,
and
as
that
left
too
short
a
period
for
them
to
go
so
far,
and
see
so
much
as
they
had
proposed,
or
at
least
to
see
it
with
the
leisure
and
comfort
they
had
built
on,
they
were
obliged
to
give
up
the
Lakes,
and
substitute
a
more
contracted
tour,
and,
according
to
the
present
plan,
were
to
go
no
farther
northwards
than
Derbyshire.
In
that
county
there
was
enough
to
be
seen
to
occupy
the
chief
of
their
three
weeks;
and
to
Mrs.
Gardiner
it
had
a
peculiarly
strong
attraction.
The
town
where
she
had
formerly
passed
some
years
of
her
life,
and
where
they
were
now
to
spend
a
few
days,
was
probably
as
great
an
object
of
her
curiosity
as
all
the
celebrated
beauties
of
Matlock,
Chatsworth,
Dovedale,
or
the
Peak.
Elizabeth
was
excessively
disappointed;
she
had
set
her
heart
on
seeing
the
Lakes,
and
still
thought
there
might
have
been
time
enough.
But
it
was
her
business
to
be
satisfied
and
certainly
her
temper
to
be
happy;
and
all
was
soon
right
again.
With
the
mention
of
Derbyshire
there
were
many
ideas
connected.
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
see
the
word
without
thinking
of
Pemberley
and
its
owner.
