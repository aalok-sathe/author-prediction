on.
At
length,
quite
exhausted
by
the
attempt
to
be
amused
with
her
own
book,
which
she
had
only
chosen
because
it
was
the
second
volume
of
his,
she
gave
a
great
yawn
and
said,
"How
pleasant
it
is
to
spend
an
evening
in
this
way!
I
declare
after
all
there
is
no
enjoyment
like
reading!
How
much
sooner
one
tires
of
anything
than
of
a
book!
When
I
have
a
house
of
my
own,
I
shall
be
miserable
if
I
have
not
an
excellent
library."
No
one
made
any
reply.
She
then
yawned
again,
threw
aside
her
book,
and
cast
her
eyes
round
the
room
in
quest
for
some
amusement;
when
hearing
her
brother
mentioning
a
ball
to
Miss
Bennet,
she
turned
suddenly
towards
him
and
said:
"By
the
bye,
Charles,
are
you
really
serious
in
meditating
a
dance
at
Netherfield?
I
would
advise
you,
before
you
determine
on
it,
to
consult
the
wishes
of
the
present
party;
I
am
much
mistaken
if
there
are
not
some
among
us
to
whom
a
ball
would
be
rather
a
punishment
than
a
pleasure."
"If
you
mean
Darcy,"
cried
her
brother,
"he
may
go
to
bed,
if
he
chooses,
before
it
begins
but
as
for
the
ball,
it
is
quite
a
settled
thing;
and
as
soon
as
Nicholls
has
made
white
soup
enough,
I
shall
send
round
my
cards."
"I
should
like
balls
infinitely
better,"
she
replied,
"if
they
were
carried
on
in
a
different
manner;
but
there
is
something
insufferably
tedious
in
the
usual
process
of
such
a
meeting.
It
would
surely
be
much
more
rational
if
conversation
instead
of
dancing
were
made
the
order
of
the
day."
"Much
more
rational,
my
dear
Caroline,
I
dare
say,
but
it
would
not
be
near
so
much
like
a
ball."
Miss
Bingley
made
no
answer,
and
soon
afterwards
she
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room.
Her
figure
was
elegant,
and
she
walked
well;
but
Darcy,
at
whom
it
was
all
aimed,
was
still
inflexibly
studious.
In
the
desperation
of
her
feelings,
she
resolved
on
one
effort
more,
and,
turning
to
Elizabeth,
said:
"Miss
Eliza
Bennet,
let
me
persuade
you
to
follow
my
example,
and
take
a
turn
about
the
room.
I
assure
you
it
is
very
refreshing
after
sitting
so
long
in
one
attitude."
Elizabeth
was
surprised,
but
agreed
to
it
immediately.
Miss
Bingley
succeeded
no
less
in
the
real
object
of
her
civility;
Mr.
Darcy
looked
up.
He
was
as
much
awake
to
the
novelty
of
attention
in
that
quarter
as
Elizabeth
herself
could
be,
and
unconsciously
closed
his
book.
He
was
directly
invited
to
join
their
party,
but
he
declined
it,
observing
that
he
could
imagine
but
two
motives
for
their
choosing
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
together,
with
either
of
which
motives
his
joining
them
would
interfere.
"What
could
he
mean?
She
was
dying
to
know
what
could
be
his
meaning?"
and
asked
Elizabeth
whether
she
could
at
all
understand
him?
"Not
at
all,"
was
her
answer;
