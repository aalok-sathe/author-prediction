venture
to
declare,
that
Mr.
Knightley
is
the
last
man
in
the
world,
who
would
intentionally
give
any
woman
the
idea
of
his
feeling
for
her
more
than
he
really
does."
Harriet
seemed
ready
to
worship
her
friend
for
a
sentence
so
satisfactory;
and
Emma
was
only
saved
from
raptures
and
fondness,
which
at
that
moment
would
have
been
dreadful
penance,
by
the
sound
of
her
father's
footsteps.
He
was
coming
through
the
hall.
Harriet
was
too
much
agitated
to
encounter
him.
"She
could
not
compose
herself
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
be
alarmed
she
had
better
go;"
with
most
ready
encouragement
from
her
friend,
therefore,
she
passed
off
through
another
door
and
the
moment
she
was
gone,
this
was
the
spontaneous
burst
of
Emma's
feelings:
"Oh
God!
that
I
had
never
seen
her!"
The
rest
of
the
day,
the
following
night,
were
hardly
enough
for
her
thoughts.
She
was
bewildered
amidst
the
confusion
of
all
that
had
rushed
on
her
within
the
last
few
hours.
Every
moment
had
brought
a
fresh
surprize;
and
every
surprize
must
be
matter
of
humiliation
to
her.
How
to
understand
it
all!
How
to
understand
the
deceptions
she
had
been
thus
practising
on
herself,
and
living
under!
The
blunders,
the
blindness
of
her
own
head
and
heart!
she
sat
still,
she
walked
about,
she
tried
her
own
room,
she
tried
the
shrubbery
in
every
place,
every
posture,
she
perceived
that
she
had
acted
most
weakly;
that
she
had
been
imposed
on
by
others
in
a
most
mortifying
degree;
that
she
had
been
imposing
on
herself
in
a
degree
yet
more
mortifying;
that
she
was
wretched,
and
should
probably
find
this
day
but
the
beginning
of
wretchedness.
To
understand,
thoroughly
understand
her
own
heart,
was
the
first
endeavour.
To
that
point
went
every
leisure
moment
which
her
father's
claims
on
her
allowed,
and
every
moment
of
involuntary
absence
of
mind.
How
long
had
Mr.
Knightley
been
so
dear
to
her,
as
every
feeling
declared
him
now
to
be?
When
had
his
influence,
such
influence
begun?
When
had
he
succeeded
to
that
place
in
her
affection,
which
Frank
Churchill
had
once,
for
a
short
period,
occupied?
She
looked
back;
she
compared
the
two
compared
them,
as
they
had
always
stood
in
her
estimation,
from
the
time
of
the
latter's
becoming
known
to
her
and
as
they
must
at
any
time
have
been
compared
by
her,
had
it
oh!
had
it,
by
any
blessed
felicity,
occurred
to
her,
to
institute
the
comparison.
She
saw
that
there
never
had
been
a
time
when
she
did
not
consider
Mr.
Knightley
as
infinitely
the
superior,
or
when
his
regard
for
her
had
not
been
infinitely
the
most
dear.
She
saw,
that
in
persuading
herself,
in
fancying,
in
acting
to
the
contrary,
she
had
been
entirely
under
a
delusion,
totally
ignorant
of
her
own
heart
and,
in
short,
that
she
had
never
really
cared
for
Frank
Churchill
at
all!
This
was
the
conclusion
of
the
first
series
of
reflection.
This
was
the
knowledge
