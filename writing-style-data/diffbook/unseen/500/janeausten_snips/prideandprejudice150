"But
surely,"
said
she,
"I
may
enter
his
county
with
impunity,
and
rob
it
of
a
few
petrified
spars
without
his
perceiving
me."
The
period
of
expectation
was
now
doubled.
Four
weeks
were
to
pass
away
before
her
uncle
and
aunt's
arrival.
But
they
did
pass
away,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner,
with
their
four
children,
did
at
length
appear
at
Longbourn.
The
children,
two
girls
of
six
and
eight
years
old,
and
two
younger
boys,
were
to
be
left
under
the
particular
care
of
their
cousin
Jane,
who
was
the
general
favourite,
and
whose
steady
sense
and
sweetness
of
temper
exactly
adapted
her
for
attending
to
them
in
every
way
teaching
them,
playing
with
them,
and
loving
them.
The
Gardiners
stayed
only
one
night
at
Longbourn,
and
set
off
the
next
morning
with
Elizabeth
in
pursuit
of
novelty
and
amusement.
One
enjoyment
was
certain
that
of
suitableness
of
companions;
a
suitableness
which
comprehended
health
and
temper
to
bear
inconveniences
cheerfulness
to
enhance
every
pleasure
and
affection
and
intelligence,
which
might
supply
it
among
themselves
if
there
were
disappointments
abroad.
It
is
not
the
object
of
this
work
to
give
a
description
of
Derbyshire,
nor
of
any
of
the
remarkable
places
through
which
their
route
thither
lay;
Oxford,
Blenheim,
Warwick,
Kenilworth,
Birmingham,
etc.
are
sufficiently
known.
A
small
part
of
Derbyshire
is
all
the
present
concern.
To
the
little
town
of
Lambton,
the
scene
of
Mrs.
Gardiner's
former
residence,
and
where
she
had
lately
learned
some
acquaintance
still
remained,
they
bent
their
steps,
after
having
seen
all
the
principal
wonders
of
the
country;
and
within
five
miles
of
Lambton,
Elizabeth
found
from
her
aunt
that
Pemberley
was
situated.
It
was
not
in
their
direct
road,
nor
more
than
a
mile
or
two
out
of
it.
In
talking
over
their
route
the
evening
before,
Mrs.
Gardiner
expressed
an
inclination
to
see
the
place
again.
Mr.
Gardiner
declared
his
willingness,
and
Elizabeth
was
applied
to
for
her
approbation.
"My
love,
should
not
you
like
to
see
a
place
of
which
you
have
heard
so
much?"
said
her
aunt;
"a
place,
too,
with
which
so
many
of
your
acquaintances
are
connected.
Wickham
passed
all
his
youth
there,
you
know."
Elizabeth
was
distressed.
She
felt
that
she
had
no
business
at
Pemberley,
and
was
obliged
to
assume
a
disinclination
for
seeing
it.
She
must
own
that
she
was
tired
of
seeing
great
houses;
after
going
over
so
many,
she
really
had
no
pleasure
in
fine
carpets
or
satin
curtains.
Mrs.
Gardiner
abused
her
stupidity.
"If
it
were
merely
a
fine
house
richly
furnished,"
said
she,
"I
should
not
care
about
it
myself;
but
the
grounds
are
delightful.
They
have
some
of
the
finest
woods
in
the
country."
Elizabeth
said
no
more
but
her
mind
could
not
acquiesce.
The
possibility
of
meeting
Mr.
Darcy,
while
viewing
the
place,
instantly
occurred.
It
would
be
dreadful!
She
blushed
at
the
very
idea,
and
thought
it
would
be
better
to
speak
openly
to
her
aunt
than
to
run
