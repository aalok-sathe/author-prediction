he
would
only
talk
louder,
and
drown
her
voice.
But
the
question
is
not,
whether
it
would
be
a
bad
connexion
for
him,
but
whether
he
wishes
it;
and
I
think
he
does.
I
have
heard
him
speak,
and
so
must
you,
so
very
highly
of
Jane
Fairfax!
The
interest
he
takes
in
her
his
anxiety
about
her
health
his
concern
that
she
should
have
no
happier
prospect!
I
have
heard
him
express
himself
so
warmly
on
those
points!
Such
an
admirer
of
her
performance
on
the
pianoforte,
and
of
her
voice!
I
have
heard
him
say
that
he
could
listen
to
her
for
ever.
Oh!
and
I
had
almost
forgotten
one
idea
that
occurred
to
me
this
pianoforte
that
has
been
sent
here
by
somebody
though
we
have
all
been
so
well
satisfied
to
consider
it
a
present
from
the
Campbells,
may
it
not
be
from
Mr.
Knightley?
I
cannot
help
suspecting
him.
I
think
he
is
just
the
person
to
do
it,
even
without
being
in
love."
"Then
it
can
be
no
argument
to
prove
that
he
is
in
love.
But
I
do
not
think
it
is
at
all
a
likely
thing
for
him
to
do.
Mr.
Knightley
does
nothing
mysteriously."
"I
have
heard
him
lamenting
her
having
no
instrument
repeatedly;
oftener
than
I
should
suppose
such
a
circumstance
would,
in
the
common
course
of
things,
occur
to
him."
"Very
well;
and
if
he
had
intended
to
give
her
one,
he
would
have
told
her
so."
"There
might
be
scruples
of
delicacy,
my
dear
Emma.
I
have
a
very
strong
notion
that
it
comes
from
him.
I
am
sure
he
was
particularly
silent
when
Mrs.
Cole
told
us
of
it
at
dinner."
"You
take
up
an
idea,
Mrs.
Weston,
and
run
away
with
it;
as
you
have
many
a
time
reproached
me
with
doing.
I
see
no
sign
of
attachment
I
believe
nothing
of
the
pianoforte
and
proof
only
shall
convince
me
that
Mr.
Knightley
has
any
thought
of
marrying
Jane
Fairfax."
They
combated
the
point
some
time
longer
in
the
same
way;
Emma
rather
gaining
ground
over
the
mind
of
her
friend;
for
Mrs.
Weston
was
the
most
used
of
the
two
to
yield;
till
a
little
bustle
in
the
room
shewed
them
that
tea
was
over,
and
the
instrument
in
preparation;
and
at
the
same
moment
Mr.
Cole
approaching
to
entreat
Miss
Woodhouse
would
do
them
the
honour
of
trying
it.
Frank
Churchill,
of
whom,
in
the
eagerness
of
her
conversation
with
Mrs.
Weston,
she
had
been
seeing
nothing,
except
that
he
had
found
a
seat
by
Miss
Fairfax,
followed
Mr.
Cole,
to
add
his
very
pressing
entreaties;
and
as,
in
every
respect,
it
suited
Emma
best
to
lead,
she
gave
a
very
proper
compliance.
She
knew
the
limitations
of
her
own
powers
too
well
to
attempt
more
than
she
could
perform
with
credit;
she
wanted
neither
taste
nor
spirit
in
the
little
things
which
are
generally
acceptable,
and
could
accompany
her
own
voice
well.
