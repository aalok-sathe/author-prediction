her
younger
girls,
and
Mary
might
have
been
prevailed
on
to
accept
him.
She
rated
his
abilities
much
higher
than
any
of
the
others;
there
was
a
solidity
in
his
reflections
which
often
struck
her,
and
though
by
no
means
so
clever
as
herself,
she
thought
that
if
encouraged
to
read
and
improve
himself
by
such
an
example
as
hers,
he
might
become
a
very
agreeable
companion.
But
on
the
following
morning,
every
hope
of
this
kind
was
done
away.
Miss
Lucas
called
soon
after
breakfast,
and
in
a
private
conference
with
Elizabeth
related
the
event
of
the
day
before.
The
possibility
of
Mr.
Collins's
fancying
himself
in
love
with
her
friend
had
once
occurred
to
Elizabeth
within
the
last
day
or
two;
but
that
Charlotte
could
encourage
him
seemed
almost
as
far
from
possibility
as
she
could
encourage
him
herself,
and
her
astonishment
was
consequently
so
great
as
to
overcome
at
first
the
bounds
of
decorum,
and
she
could
not
help
crying
out:
"Engaged
to
Mr.
Collins!
My
dear
Charlotte
impossible!"
The
steady
countenance
which
Miss
Lucas
had
commanded
in
telling
her
story,
gave
way
to
a
momentary
confusion
here
on
receiving
so
direct
a
reproach;
though,
as
it
was
no
more
than
she
expected,
she
soon
regained
her
composure,
and
calmly
replied:
"Why
should
you
be
surprised,
my
dear
Eliza?
Do
you
think
it
incredible
that
Mr.
Collins
should
be
able
to
procure
any
woman's
good
opinion,
because
he
was
not
so
happy
as
to
succeed
with
you?"
But
Elizabeth
had
now
recollected
herself,
and
making
a
strong
effort
for
it,
was
able
to
assure
with
tolerable
firmness
that
the
prospect
of
their
relationship
was
highly
grateful
to
her,
and
that
she
wished
her
all
imaginable
happiness.
"I
see
what
you
are
feeling,"
replied
Charlotte.
"You
must
be
surprised,
very
much
surprised
so
lately
as
Mr.
Collins
was
wishing
to
marry
you.
But
when
you
have
had
time
to
think
it
over,
I
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
with
what
I
have
done.
I
am
not
romantic,
you
know;
I
never
was.
I
ask
only
a
comfortable
home;
and
considering
Mr.
Collins's
character,
connection,
and
situation
in
life,
I
am
convinced
that
my
chance
of
happiness
with
him
is
as
fair
as
most
people
can
boast
on
entering
the
marriage
state."
Elizabeth
quietly
answered
"Undoubtedly;"
and
after
an
awkward
pause,
they
returned
to
the
rest
of
the
family.
Charlotte
did
not
stay
much
longer,
and
Elizabeth
was
then
left
to
reflect
on
what
she
had
heard.
It
was
a
long
time
before
she
became
at
all
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
so
unsuitable
a
match.
The
strangeness
of
Mr.
Collins's
making
two
offers
of
marriage
within
three
days
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
his
being
now
accepted.
She
had
always
felt
that
Charlotte's
opinion
of
matrimony
was
not
exactly
like
her
own,
but
she
had
not
supposed
it
to
be
possible
that,
when
called
into
action,
she
would
have
sacrificed
every
better
feeling
to
worldly
advantage.
