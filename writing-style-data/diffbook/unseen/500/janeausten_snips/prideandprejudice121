the
last
man
in
the
world
whom
I
could
ever
be
prevailed
on
to
marry."
"You
have
said
quite
enough,
madam.
I
perfectly
comprehend
your
feelings,
and
have
now
only
to
be
ashamed
of
what
my
own
have
been.
Forgive
me
for
having
taken
up
so
much
of
your
time,
and
accept
my
best
wishes
for
your
health
and
happiness."
And
with
these
words
he
hastily
left
the
room,
and
Elizabeth
heard
him
the
next
moment
open
the
front
door
and
quit
the
house.
The
tumult
of
her
mind,
was
now
painfully
great.
She
knew
not
how
to
support
herself,
and
from
actual
weakness
sat
down
and
cried
for
half
an
hour.
Her
astonishment,
as
she
reflected
on
what
had
passed,
was
increased
by
every
review
of
it.
That
she
should
receive
an
offer
of
marriage
from
Mr.
Darcy!
That
he
should
have
been
in
love
with
her
for
so
many
months!
So
much
in
love
as
to
wish
to
marry
her
in
spite
of
all
the
objections
which
had
made
him
prevent
his
friend's
marrying
her
sister,
and
which
must
appear
at
least
with
equal
force
in
his
own
case
was
almost
incredible!
It
was
gratifying
to
have
inspired
unconsciously
so
strong
an
affection.
But
his
pride,
his
abominable
pride
his
shameless
avowal
of
what
he
had
done
with
respect
to
Jane
his
unpardonable
assurance
in
acknowledging,
though
he
could
not
justify
it,
and
the
unfeeling
manner
in
which
he
had
mentioned
Mr.
Wickham,
his
cruelty
towards
whom
he
had
not
attempted
to
deny,
soon
overcame
the
pity
which
the
consideration
of
his
attachment
had
for
a
moment
excited.
She
continued
in
very
agitated
reflections
till
the
sound
of
Lady
Catherine's
carriage
made
her
feel
how
unequal
she
was
to
encounter
Charlotte's
observation,
and
hurried
her
away
to
her
room.
Elizabeth
awoke
the
next
morning
to
the
same
thoughts
and
meditations
which
had
at
length
closed
her
eyes.
She
could
not
yet
recover
from
the
surprise
of
what
had
happened;
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
anything
else;
and,
totally
indisposed
for
employment,
she
resolved,
soon
after
breakfast,
to
indulge
herself
in
air
and
exercise.
She
was
proceeding
directly
to
her
favourite
walk,
when
the
recollection
of
Mr.
Darcy's
sometimes
coming
there
stopped
her,
and
instead
of
entering
the
park,
she
turned
up
the
lane,
which
led
farther
from
the
turnpike
road.
The
park
paling
was
still
the
boundary
on
one
side,
and
she
soon
passed
one
of
the
gates
into
the
ground.
After
walking
two
or
three
times
along
that
part
of
the
lane,
she
was
tempted,
by
the
pleasantness
of
the
morning,
to
stop
at
the
gates
and
look
into
the
park.
The
five
weeks
which
she
had
now
passed
in
Kent
had
made
a
great
difference
in
the
country,
and
every
day
was
adding
to
the
verdure
of
the
early
trees.
She
was
on
the
point
of
continuing
her
walk,
when
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
gentleman
within
the
sort
of
grove
which
edged
the
