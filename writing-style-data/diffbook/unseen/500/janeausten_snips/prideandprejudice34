"but
depend
upon
it,
he
means
to
be
severe
on
us,
and
our
surest
way
of
disappointing
him
will
be
to
ask
nothing
about
it."
Miss
Bingley,
however,
was
incapable
of
disappointing
Mr.
Darcy
in
anything,
and
persevered
therefore
in
requiring
an
explanation
of
his
two
motives.
"I
have
not
the
smallest
objection
to
explaining
them,"
said
he,
as
soon
as
she
allowed
him
to
speak.
"You
either
choose
this
method
of
passing
the
evening
because
you
are
in
each
other's
confidence,
and
have
secret
affairs
to
discuss,
or
because
you
are
conscious
that
your
figures
appear
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
walking;
if
the
first,
I
would
be
completely
in
your
way,
and
if
the
second,
I
can
admire
you
much
better
as
I
sit
by
the
fire."
"Oh!
shocking!"
cried
Miss
Bingley.
"I
never
heard
anything
so
abominable.
How
shall
we
punish
him
for
such
a
speech?"
"Nothing
so
easy,
if
you
have
but
the
inclination,"
said
Elizabeth.
"We
can
all
plague
and
punish
one
another.
Tease
him
laugh
at
him.
Intimate
as
you
are,
you
must
know
how
it
is
to
be
done."
"But
upon
my
honour,
I
do
not.
I
do
assure
you
that
my
intimacy
has
not
yet
taught
me
that.
Tease
calmness
of
manner
and
presence
of
mind!
No,
no;
I
feel
he
may
defy
us
there.
And
as
to
laughter,
we
will
not
expose
ourselves,
if
you
please,
by
attempting
to
laugh
without
a
subject.
Mr.
Darcy
may
hug
himself."
"Mr.
Darcy
is
not
to
be
laughed
at!"
cried
Elizabeth.
"That
is
an
uncommon
advantage,
and
uncommon
I
hope
it
will
continue,
for
it
would
be
a
great
loss
to
me
to
have
many
such
acquaintances.
I
dearly
love
a
laugh."
"Miss
Bingley,"
said
he,
"has
given
me
more
credit
than
can
be.
The
wisest
and
the
best
of
men
nay,
the
wisest
and
best
of
their
actions
may
be
rendered
ridiculous
by
a
person
whose
first
object
in
life
is
a
joke."
"Certainly,"
replied
Elizabeth
"there
are
such
people,
but
I
hope
I
am
not
one
of
them.
I
hope
I
never
ridicule
what
is
wise
and
good.
Follies
and
nonsense,
whims
and
inconsistencies,
do
divert
me,
I
own,
and
I
laugh
at
them
whenever
I
can.
But
these,
I
suppose,
are
precisely
what
you
are
without."
"Perhaps
that
is
not
possible
for
anyone.
But
it
has
been
the
study
of
my
life
to
avoid
those
weaknesses
which
often
expose
a
strong
understanding
to
ridicule."
"Such
as
vanity
and
pride."
"Yes,
vanity
is
a
weakness
indeed.
But
pride
where
there
is
a
real
superiority
of
mind,
pride
will
be
always
under
good
regulation."
Elizabeth
turned
away
to
hide
a
smile.
"Your
examination
of
Mr.
Darcy
is
over,
I
presume,"
said
Miss
Bingley;
"and
pray
what
is
the
result?"
"I
am
perfectly
convinced
by
it
that
Mr.
Darcy
has
no
defect.
He
owns
it
himself
without
disguise."
"No,"
said
Darcy,
"I
have
made
no
such
pretension.
I
have
faults
enough,
but
they
are
