ball,
which
she
walked
about
the
lawn
the
next
morning
to
enjoy.
She
was
extremely
glad
that
they
had
come
to
so
good
an
understanding
respecting
the
Eltons,
and
that
their
opinions
of
both
husband
and
wife
were
so
much
alike;
and
his
praise
of
Harriet,
his
concession
in
her
favour,
was
peculiarly
gratifying.
The
impertinence
of
the
Eltons,
which
for
a
few
minutes
had
threatened
to
ruin
the
rest
of
her
evening,
had
been
the
occasion
of
some
of
its
highest
satisfactions;
and
she
looked
forward
to
another
happy
result
the
cure
of
Harriet's
infatuation.
From
Harriet's
manner
of
speaking
of
the
circumstance
before
they
quitted
the
ballroom,
she
had
strong
hopes.
It
seemed
as
if
her
eyes
were
suddenly
opened,
and
she
were
enabled
to
see
that
Mr.
Elton
was
not
the
superior
creature
she
had
believed
him.
The
fever
was
over,
and
Emma
could
harbour
little
fear
of
the
pulse
being
quickened
again
by
injurious
courtesy.
She
depended
on
the
evil
feelings
of
the
Eltons
for
supplying
all
the
discipline
of
pointed
neglect
that
could
be
farther
requisite.
Harriet
rational,
Frank
Churchill
not
too
much
in
love,
and
Mr.
Knightley
not
wanting
to
quarrel
with
her,
how
very
happy
a
summer
must
be
before
her!
She
was
not
to
see
Frank
Churchill
this
morning.
He
had
told
her
that
he
could
not
allow
himself
the
pleasure
of
stopping
at
Hartfield,
as
he
was
to
be
at
home
by
the
middle
of
the
day.
She
did
not
regret
it.
Having
arranged
all
these
matters,
looked
them
through,
and
put
them
all
to
rights,
she
was
just
turning
to
the
house
with
spirits
freshened
up
for
the
demands
of
the
two
little
boys,
as
well
as
of
their
grandpapa,
when
the
great
iron
sweep
gate
opened,
and
two
persons
entered
whom
she
had
never
less
expected
to
see
together
Frank
Churchill,
with
Harriet
leaning
on
his
arm
actually
Harriet!
A
moment
sufficed
to
convince
her
that
something
extraordinary
had
happened.
Harriet
looked
white
and
frightened,
and
he
was
trying
to
cheer
her.
The
iron
gates
and
the
front
door
were
not
twenty
yards
asunder;
they
were
all
three
soon
in
the
hall,
and
Harriet
immediately
sinking
into
a
chair
fainted
away.
A
young
lady
who
faints,
must
be
recovered;
questions
must
be
answered,
and
surprizes
be
explained.
Such
events
are
very
interesting,
but
the
suspense
of
them
cannot
last
long.
A
few
minutes
made
Emma
acquainted
with
the
whole.
Miss
Smith,
and
Miss
Bickerton,
another
parlour
boarder
at
Mrs.
Goddard's,
who
had
been
also
at
the
ball,
had
walked
out
together,
and
taken
a
road,
the
Richmond
road,
which,
though
apparently
public
enough
for
safety,
had
led
them
into
alarm.
About
half
a
mile
beyond
Highbury,
making
a
sudden
turn,
and
deeply
shaded
by
elms
on
each
side,
it
became
for
a
considerable
stretch
very
retired;
and
when
the
young
ladies
had
advanced
some
way
into
it,
they
had
suddenly
perceived
at
a
small
distance
before
them,
on
a
