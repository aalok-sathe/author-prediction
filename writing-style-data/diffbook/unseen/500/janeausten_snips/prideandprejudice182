be
off.
You
need
not
send
them
word
at
Longbourn
of
my
going,
if
you
do
not
like
it,
for
it
will
make
the
surprise
the
greater,
when
I
write
to
them
and
sign
my
name
'Lydia
Wickham.'
What
a
good
joke
it
will
be!
I
can
hardly
write
for
laughing.
Pray
make
my
excuses
to
Pratt
for
not
keeping
my
engagement,
and
dancing
with
him
to
night.
Tell
him
I
hope
he
will
excuse
me
when
he
knows
all;
and
tell
him
I
will
dance
with
him
at
the
next
ball
we
meet,
with
great
pleasure.
I
shall
send
for
my
clothes
when
I
get
to
Longbourn;
but
I
wish
you
would
tell
Sally
to
mend
a
great
slit
in
my
worked
muslin
gown
before
they
are
packed
up.
Good
bye.
Give
my
love
to
Colonel
Forster.
I
hope
you
will
drink
to
our
good
journey.
"Your
affectionate
friend,
"LYDIA
BENNET."
"Oh!
thoughtless,
thoughtless
Lydia!"
cried
Elizabeth
when
she
had
finished
it.
"What
a
letter
is
this,
to
be
written
at
such
a
moment!
But
at
least
it
shows
that
she
was
serious
on
the
subject
of
their
journey.
Whatever
he
might
afterwards
persuade
her
to,
it
was
not
on
her
side
a
scheme
of
infamy.
My
poor
father!
how
he
must
have
felt
it!"
"I
never
saw
anyone
so
shocked.
He
could
not
speak
a
word
for
full
ten
minutes.
My
mother
was
taken
ill
immediately,
and
the
whole
house
in
such
confusion!"
"Oh!
Jane,"
cried
Elizabeth,
"was
there
a
servant
belonging
to
it
who
did
not
know
the
whole
story
before
the
end
of
the
day?"
"I
do
not
know.
I
hope
there
was.
But
to
be
guarded
at
such
a
time
is
very
difficult.
My
mother
was
in
hysterics,
and
though
I
endeavoured
to
give
her
every
assistance
in
my
power,
I
am
afraid
I
did
not
do
so
much
as
I
might
have
done!
But
the
horror
of
what
might
possibly
happen
almost
took
from
me
my
faculties."
"Your
attendance
upon
her
has
been
too
much
for
you.
You
do
not
look
well.
Oh
that
I
had
been
with
you!
you
have
had
every
care
and
anxiety
upon
yourself
alone."
"Mary
and
Kitty
have
been
very
kind,
and
would
have
shared
in
every
fatigue,
I
am
sure;
but
I
did
not
think
it
right
for
either
of
them.
Kitty
is
slight
and
delicate;
and
Mary
studies
so
much,
that
her
hours
of
repose
should
not
be
broken
in
on.
My
aunt
Phillips
came
to
Longbourn
on
Tuesday,
after
my
father
went
away;
and
was
so
good
as
to
stay
till
Thursday
with
me.
She
was
of
great
use
and
comfort
to
us
all.
And
Lady
Lucas
has
been
very
kind;
she
walked
here
on
Wednesday
morning
to
condole
with
us,
and
offered
her
services,
or
any
of
her
daughters',
if
they
should
be
of
use
to
us."
"She
had
better
have
stayed
at
home,"
cried
Elizabeth;
"perhaps
she
meant
well,
but,
under
such
a
misfortune
