to
accompany
them.
"To
fall
in
with
each
other
on
such
an
errand
as
this,"
thought
Emma;
"to
meet
in
a
charitable
scheme;
this
will
bring
a
great
increase
of
love
on
each
side.
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
were
to
bring
on
the
declaration.
It
must,
if
I
were
not
here.
I
wish
I
were
anywhere
else."
Anxious
to
separate
herself
from
them
as
far
as
she
could,
she
soon
afterwards
took
possession
of
a
narrow
footpath,
a
little
raised
on
one
side
of
the
lane,
leaving
them
together
in
the
main
road.
But
she
had
not
been
there
two
minutes
when
she
found
that
Harriet's
habits
of
dependence
and
imitation
were
bringing
her
up
too,
and
that,
in
short,
they
would
both
be
soon
after
her.
This
would
not
do;
she
immediately
stopped,
under
pretence
of
having
some
alteration
to
make
in
the
lacing
of
her
half
boot,
and
stooping
down
in
complete
occupation
of
the
footpath,
begged
them
to
have
the
goodness
to
walk
on,
and
she
would
follow
in
half
a
minute.
They
did
as
they
were
desired;
and
by
the
time
she
judged
it
reasonable
to
have
done
with
her
boot,
she
had
the
comfort
of
farther
delay
in
her
power,
being
overtaken
by
a
child
from
the
cottage,
setting
out,
according
to
orders,
with
her
pitcher,
to
fetch
broth
from
Hartfield.
To
walk
by
the
side
of
this
child,
and
talk
to
and
question
her,
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world,
or
would
have
been
the
most
natural,
had
she
been
acting
just
then
without
design;
and
by
this
means
the
others
were
still
able
to
keep
ahead,
without
any
obligation
of
waiting
for
her.
She
gained
on
them,
however,
involuntarily:
the
child's
pace
was
quick,
and
theirs
rather
slow;
and
she
was
the
more
concerned
at
it,
from
their
being
evidently
in
a
conversation
which
interested
them.
Mr.
Elton
was
speaking
with
animation,
Harriet
listening
with
a
very
pleased
attention;
and
Emma,
having
sent
the
child
on,
was
beginning
to
think
how
she
might
draw
back
a
little
more,
when
they
both
looked
around,
and
she
was
obliged
to
join
them.
Mr.
Elton
was
still
talking,
still
engaged
in
some
interesting
detail;
and
Emma
experienced
some
disappointment
when
she
found
that
he
was
only
giving
his
fair
companion
an
account
of
the
yesterday's
party
at
his
friend
Cole's,
and
that
she
was
come
in
herself
for
the
Stilton
cheese,
the
north
Wiltshire,
the
butter,
the
celery,
the
beet
root,
and
all
the
dessert.
"This
would
soon
have
led
to
something
better,
of
course,"
was
her
consoling
reflection;
"any
thing
interests
between
those
who
love;
and
any
thing
will
serve
as
introduction
to
what
is
near
the
heart.
If
I
could
but
have
kept
longer
away!"
They
now
walked
on
together
quietly,
till
within
view
of
the
vicarage
pales,
when
a
sudden
resolution,
of
at
least
getting
Harriet
into
the
house,
made
her
again
find
something
very
much
amiss
about
her
