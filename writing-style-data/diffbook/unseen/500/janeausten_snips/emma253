a
very
agreeable
evening
we
had.
Such
kind
friends,
you
know,
Miss
Woodhouse,
one
must
always
find
agreeable,
though
every
body
seemed
rather
fagged
after
the
morning's
party.
Even
pleasure,
you
know,
is
fatiguing
and
I
cannot
say
that
any
of
them
seemed
very
much
to
have
enjoyed
it.
However,
I
shall
always
think
it
a
very
pleasant
party,
and
feel
extremely
obliged
to
the
kind
friends
who
included
me
in
it."
"Miss
Fairfax,
I
suppose,
though
you
were
not
aware
of
it,
had
been
making
up
her
mind
the
whole
day?"
"I
dare
say
she
had."
"Whenever
the
time
may
come,
it
must
be
unwelcome
to
her
and
all
her
friends
but
I
hope
her
engagement
will
have
every
alleviation
that
is
possible
I
mean,
as
to
the
character
and
manners
of
the
family."
"Thank
you,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse.
Yes,
indeed,
there
is
every
thing
in
the
world
that
can
make
her
happy
in
it.
Except
the
Sucklings
and
Bragges,
there
is
not
such
another
nursery
establishment,
so
liberal
and
elegant,
in
all
Mrs.
Elton's
acquaintance.
Mrs.
Smallridge,
a
most
delightful
woman!
A
style
of
living
almost
equal
to
Maple
Grove
and
as
to
the
children,
except
the
little
Sucklings
and
little
Bragges,
there
are
not
such
elegant
sweet
children
anywhere.
Jane
will
be
treated
with
such
regard
and
kindness!
It
will
be
nothing
but
pleasure,
a
life
of
pleasure.
And
her
salary!
I
really
cannot
venture
to
name
her
salary
to
you,
Miss
Woodhouse.
Even
you,
used
as
you
are
to
great
sums,
would
hardly
believe
that
so
much
could
be
given
to
a
young
person
like
Jane."
"Ah!
madam,"
cried
Emma,
"if
other
children
are
at
all
like
what
I
remember
to
have
been
myself,
I
should
think
five
times
the
amount
of
what
I
have
ever
yet
heard
named
as
a
salary
on
such
occasions,
dearly
earned."
"You
are
so
noble
in
your
ideas!"
"And
when
is
Miss
Fairfax
to
leave
you?"
"Very
soon,
very
soon,
indeed;
that's
the
worst
of
it.
Within
a
fortnight.
Mrs.
Smallridge
is
in
a
great
hurry.
My
poor
mother
does
not
know
how
to
bear
it.
So
then,
I
try
to
put
it
out
of
her
thoughts,
and
say,
Come
ma'am,
do
not
let
us
think
about
it
any
more."
"Her
friends
must
all
be
sorry
to
lose
her;
and
will
not
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
be
sorry
to
find
that
she
has
engaged
herself
before
their
return?"
"Yes;
Jane
says
she
is
sure
they
will;
but
yet,
this
is
such
a
situation
as
she
cannot
feel
herself
justified
in
declining.
I
was
so
astonished
when
she
first
told
me
what
she
had
been
saying
to
Mrs.
Elton,
and
when
Mrs.
Elton
at
the
same
moment
came
congratulating
me
upon
it!
It
was
before
tea
stay
no,
it
could
not
be
before
tea,
because
we
were
just
going
to
cards
and
yet
it
was
before
tea,
because
I
remember
thinking
Oh!
no,
now
I
recollect,
now
I
have
it;
something
