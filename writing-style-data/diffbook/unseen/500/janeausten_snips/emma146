morrow
half
my
time.
I
never
knew
days
fly
so
fast.
A
week
to
morrow!
And
I
have
hardly
begun
to
enjoy
myself.
But
just
got
acquainted
with
Mrs.
Weston,
and
others!
I
hate
the
recollection."
"Perhaps
you
may
now
begin
to
regret
that
you
spent
one
whole
day,
out
of
so
few,
in
having
your
hair
cut."
"No,"
said
he,
smiling,
"that
is
no
subject
of
regret
at
all.
I
have
no
pleasure
in
seeing
my
friends,
unless
I
can
believe
myself
fit
to
be
seen."
The
rest
of
the
gentlemen
being
now
in
the
room,
Emma
found
herself
obliged
to
turn
from
him
for
a
few
minutes,
and
listen
to
Mr.
Cole.
When
Mr.
Cole
had
moved
away,
and
her
attention
could
be
restored
as
before,
she
saw
Frank
Churchill
looking
intently
across
the
room
at
Miss
Fairfax,
who
was
sitting
exactly
opposite.
"What
is
the
matter?"
said
she.
He
started.
"Thank
you
for
rousing
me,"
he
replied.
"I
believe
I
have
been
very
rude;
but
really
Miss
Fairfax
has
done
her
hair
in
so
odd
a
way
so
very
odd
a
way
that
I
cannot
keep
my
eyes
from
her.
I
never
saw
any
thing
so
outree!
Those
curls!
This
must
be
a
fancy
of
her
own.
I
see
nobody
else
looking
like
her!
I
must
go
and
ask
her
whether
it
is
an
Irish
fashion.
Shall
I?
Yes,
I
will
I
declare
I
will
and
you
shall
see
how
she
takes
it;
whether
she
colours."
He
was
gone
immediately;
and
Emma
soon
saw
him
standing
before
Miss
Fairfax,
and
talking
to
her;
but
as
to
its
effect
on
the
young
lady,
as
he
had
improvidently
placed
himself
exactly
between
them,
exactly
in
front
of
Miss
Fairfax,
she
could
absolutely
distinguish
nothing.
Before
he
could
return
to
his
chair,
it
was
taken
by
Mrs.
Weston.
"This
is
the
luxury
of
a
large
party,"
said
she:
"one
can
get
near
every
body,
and
say
every
thing.
My
dear
Emma,
I
am
longing
to
talk
to
you.
I
have
been
making
discoveries
and
forming
plans,
just
like
yourself,
and
I
must
tell
them
while
the
idea
is
fresh.
Do
you
know
how
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece
came
here?"
"How?
They
were
invited,
were
not
they?"
"Oh!
yes
but
how
they
were
conveyed
hither?
the
manner
of
their
coming?"
"They
walked,
I
conclude.
How
else
could
they
come?"
"Very
true.
Well,
a
little
while
ago
it
occurred
to
me
how
very
sad
it
would
be
to
have
Jane
Fairfax
walking
home
again,
late
at
night,
and
cold
as
the
nights
are
now.
And
as
I
looked
at
her,
though
I
never
saw
her
appear
to
more
advantage,
it
struck
me
that
she
was
heated,
and
would
therefore
be
particularly
liable
to
take
cold.
Poor
girl!
I
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
it;
so,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Weston
came
into
the
room,
and
I
could
get
at
him,
I
spoke
to
him
about
the
carriage.
You
may
guess
