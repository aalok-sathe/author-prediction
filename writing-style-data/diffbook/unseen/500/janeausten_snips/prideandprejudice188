call
them
to
their
mother,
went
forward
to
meet
her;
but,
instead
of
the
expected
summons,
when
they
approached
her,
she
said
to
Miss
Bennet,
"I
beg
your
pardon,
madam,
for
interrupting
you,
but
I
was
in
hopes
you
might
have
got
some
good
news
from
town,
so
I
took
the
liberty
of
coming
to
ask."
"What
do
you
mean,
Hill?
We
have
heard
nothing
from
town."
"Dear
madam,"
cried
Mrs.
Hill,
in
great
astonishment,
"don't
you
know
there
is
an
express
come
for
master
from
Mr.
Gardiner?
He
has
been
here
this
half
hour,
and
master
has
had
a
letter."
Away
ran
the
girls,
too
eager
to
get
in
to
have
time
for
speech.
They
ran
through
the
vestibule
into
the
breakfast
room;
from
thence
to
the
library;
their
father
was
in
neither;
and
they
were
on
the
point
of
seeking
him
up
stairs
with
their
mother,
when
they
were
met
by
the
butler,
who
said:
"If
you
are
looking
for
my
master,
ma'am,
he
is
walking
towards
the
little
copse."
Upon
this
information,
they
instantly
passed
through
the
hall
once
more,
and
ran
across
the
lawn
after
their
father,
who
was
deliberately
pursuing
his
way
towards
a
small
wood
on
one
side
of
the
paddock.
Jane,
who
was
not
so
light
nor
so
much
in
the
habit
of
running
as
Elizabeth,
soon
lagged
behind,
while
her
sister,
panting
for
breath,
came
up
with
him,
and
eagerly
cried
out:
"Oh,
papa,
what
news
what
news?
Have
you
heard
from
my
uncle?"
"Yes
I
have
had
a
letter
from
him
by
express."
"Well,
and
what
news
does
it
bring
good
or
bad?"
"What
is
there
of
good
to
be
expected?"
said
he,
taking
the
letter
from
his
pocket.
"But
perhaps
you
would
like
to
read
it."
Elizabeth
impatiently
caught
it
from
his
hand.
Jane
now
came
up.
"Read
it
aloud,"
said
their
father,
"for
I
hardly
know
myself
what
it
is
about."
"Gracechurch
Street,
Monday,
August
2.
"MY
DEAR
BROTHER,
"At
last
I
am
able
to
send
you
some
tidings
of
my
niece,
and
such
as,
upon
the
whole,
I
hope
it
will
give
you
satisfaction.
Soon
after
you
left
me
on
Saturday,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
out
in
what
part
of
London
they
were.
The
particulars
I
reserve
till
we
meet;
it
is
enough
to
know
they
are
discovered.
I
have
seen
them
both
"
"Then
it
is
as
I
always
hoped,"
cried
Jane;
"they
are
married!"
Elizabeth
read
on:
"I
have
seen
them
both.
They
are
not
married,
nor
can
I
find
there
was
any
intention
of
being
so;
but
if
you
are
willing
to
perform
the
engagements
which
I
have
ventured
to
make
on
your
side,
I
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
they
are.
All
that
is
required
of
you
is,
to
assure
to
your
daughter,
by
settlement,
her
equal
share
of
the
five
thousand
pounds
secured
among
your
children
after
the
decease
of
yourself
and
my
sister;
and,
moreover,
to
enter
into
