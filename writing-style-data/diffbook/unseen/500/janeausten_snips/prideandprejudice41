lady
indeed.
Lady
Catherine
herself
says
that,
in
point
of
true
beauty,
Miss
de
Bourgh
is
far
superior
to
the
handsomest
of
her
sex,
because
there
is
that
in
her
features
which
marks
the
young
lady
of
distinguished
birth.
She
is
unfortunately
of
a
sickly
constitution,
which
has
prevented
her
from
making
that
progress
in
many
accomplishments
which
she
could
not
have
otherwise
failed
of,
as
I
am
informed
by
the
lady
who
superintended
her
education,
and
who
still
resides
with
them.
But
she
is
perfectly
amiable,
and
often
condescends
to
drive
by
my
humble
abode
in
her
little
phaeton
and
ponies."
"Has
she
been
presented?
I
do
not
remember
her
name
among
the
ladies
at
court."
"Her
indifferent
state
of
health
unhappily
prevents
her
being
in
town;
and
by
that
means,
as
I
told
Lady
Catherine
one
day,
has
deprived
the
British
court
of
its
brightest
ornament.
Her
ladyship
seemed
pleased
with
the
idea;
and
you
may
imagine
that
I
am
happy
on
every
occasion
to
offer
those
little
delicate
compliments
which
are
always
acceptable
to
ladies.
I
have
more
than
once
observed
to
Lady
Catherine,
that
her
charming
daughter
seemed
born
to
be
a
duchess,
and
that
the
most
elevated
rank,
instead
of
giving
her
consequence,
would
be
adorned
by
her.
These
are
the
kind
of
little
things
which
please
her
ladyship,
and
it
is
a
sort
of
attention
which
I
conceive
myself
peculiarly
bound
to
pay."
"You
judge
very
properly,"
said
Mr.
Bennet,
"and
it
is
happy
for
you
that
you
possess
the
talent
of
flattering
with
delicacy.
May
I
ask
whether
these
pleasing
attentions
proceed
from
the
impulse
of
the
moment,
or
are
the
result
of
previous
study?"
"They
arise
chiefly
from
what
is
passing
at
the
time,
and
though
I
sometimes
amuse
myself
with
suggesting
and
arranging
such
little
elegant
compliments
as
may
be
adapted
to
ordinary
occasions,
I
always
wish
to
give
them
as
unstudied
an
air
as
possible."
Mr.
Bennet's
expectations
were
fully
answered.
His
cousin
was
as
absurd
as
he
had
hoped,
and
he
listened
to
him
with
the
keenest
enjoyment,
maintaining
at
the
same
time
the
most
resolute
composure
of
countenance,
and,
except
in
an
occasional
glance
at
Elizabeth,
requiring
no
partner
in
his
pleasure.
By
tea
time,
however,
the
dose
had
been
enough,
and
Mr.
Bennet
was
glad
to
take
his
guest
into
the
drawing
room
again,
and,
when
tea
was
over,
glad
to
invite
him
to
read
aloud
to
the
ladies.
Mr.
Collins
readily
assented,
and
a
book
was
produced;
but,
on
beholding
it
(for
everything
announced
it
to
be
from
a
circulating
library),
he
started
back,
and
begging
pardon,
protested
that
he
never
read
novels.
Kitty
stared
at
him,
and
Lydia
exclaimed.
Other
books
were
produced,
and
after
some
deliberation
he
chose
Fordyce's
Sermons.
Lydia
gaped
as
he
opened
the
volume,
and
before
he
had,
with
very
monotonous
solemnity,
read
three
pages,
she
interrupted
him
with:
"Do
you
know,
mamma,
that
my
uncle
Phillips
talks
of
turning
away
