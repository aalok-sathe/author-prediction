that
if
Elton
is
the
man,
I
think
it
will
be
all
labour
in
vain."
Emma
laughed
and
disclaimed.
He
continued,
"Depend
upon
it,
Elton
will
not
do.
Elton
is
a
very
good
sort
of
man,
and
a
very
respectable
vicar
of
Highbury,
but
not
at
all
likely
to
make
an
imprudent
match.
He
knows
the
value
of
a
good
income
as
well
as
any
body.
Elton
may
talk
sentimentally,
but
he
will
act
rationally.
He
is
as
well
acquainted
with
his
own
claims,
as
you
can
be
with
Harriet's.
He
knows
that
he
is
a
very
handsome
young
man,
and
a
great
favourite
wherever
he
goes;
and
from
his
general
way
of
talking
in
unreserved
moments,
when
there
are
only
men
present,
I
am
convinced
that
he
does
not
mean
to
throw
himself
away.
I
have
heard
him
speak
with
great
animation
of
a
large
family
of
young
ladies
that
his
sisters
are
intimate
with,
who
have
all
twenty
thousand
pounds
apiece."
"I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you,"
said
Emma,
laughing
again.
"If
I
had
set
my
heart
on
Mr.
Elton's
marrying
Harriet,
it
would
have
been
very
kind
to
open
my
eyes;
but
at
present
I
only
want
to
keep
Harriet
to
myself.
I
have
done
with
match
making
indeed.
I
could
never
hope
to
equal
my
own
doings
at
Randalls.
I
shall
leave
off
while
I
am
well."
"Good
morning
to
you,"
said
he,
rising
and
walking
off
abruptly.
He
was
very
much
vexed.
He
felt
the
disappointment
of
the
young
man,
and
was
mortified
to
have
been
the
means
of
promoting
it,
by
the
sanction
he
had
given;
and
the
part
which
he
was
persuaded
Emma
had
taken
in
the
affair,
was
provoking
him
exceedingly.
Emma
remained
in
a
state
of
vexation
too;
but
there
was
more
indistinctness
in
the
causes
of
her's,
than
in
his.
She
did
not
always
feel
so
absolutely
satisfied
with
herself,
so
entirely
convinced
that
her
opinions
were
right
and
her
adversary's
wrong,
as
Mr.
Knightley.
He
walked
off
in
more
complete
self
approbation
than
he
left
for
her.
She
was
not
so
materially
cast
down,
however,
but
that
a
little
time
and
the
return
of
Harriet
were
very
adequate
restoratives.
Harriet's
staying
away
so
long
was
beginning
to
make
her
uneasy.
The
possibility
of
the
young
man's
coming
to
Mrs.
Goddard's
that
morning,
and
meeting
with
Harriet
and
pleading
his
own
cause,
gave
alarming
ideas.
The
dread
of
such
a
failure
after
all
became
the
prominent
uneasiness;
and
when
Harriet
appeared,
and
in
very
good
spirits,
and
without
having
any
such
reason
to
give
for
her
long
absence,
she
felt
a
satisfaction
which
settled
her
with
her
own
mind,
and
convinced
her,
that
let
Mr.
Knightley
think
or
say
what
he
would,
she
had
done
nothing
which
woman's
friendship
and
woman's
feelings
would
not
justify.
He
had
frightened
her
a
little
about
Mr.
Elton;
but
when
she
considered
that
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
have
observed
him
as
she
had
