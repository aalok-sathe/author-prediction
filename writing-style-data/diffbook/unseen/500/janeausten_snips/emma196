the
usual
observations
made.
"I
have
heard
it
asserted,"
said
John
Knightley,
"that
the
same
sort
of
handwriting
often
prevails
in
a
family;
and
where
the
same
master
teaches,
it
is
natural
enough.
But
for
that
reason,
I
should
imagine
the
likeness
must
be
chiefly
confined
to
the
females,
for
boys
have
very
little
teaching
after
an
early
age,
and
scramble
into
any
hand
they
can
get.
Isabella
and
Emma,
I
think,
do
write
very
much
alike.
I
have
not
always
known
their
writing
apart."
"Yes,"
said
his
brother
hesitatingly,
"there
is
a
likeness.
I
know
what
you
mean
but
Emma's
hand
is
the
strongest."
"Isabella
and
Emma
both
write
beautifully,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse;
"and
always
did.
And
so
does
poor
Mrs.
Weston"
with
half
a
sigh
and
half
a
smile
at
her.
"I
never
saw
any
gentleman's
handwriting"
Emma
began,
looking
also
at
Mrs.
Weston;
but
stopped,
on
perceiving
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
attending
to
some
one
else
and
the
pause
gave
her
time
to
reflect,
"Now,
how
am
I
going
to
introduce
him?
Am
I
unequal
to
speaking
his
name
at
once
before
all
these
people?
Is
it
necessary
for
me
to
use
any
roundabout
phrase?
Your
Yorkshire
friend
your
correspondent
in
Yorkshire;
that
would
be
the
way,
I
suppose,
if
I
were
very
bad.
No,
I
can
pronounce
his
name
without
the
smallest
distress.
I
certainly
get
better
and
better.
Now
for
it."
Mrs.
Weston
was
disengaged
and
Emma
began
again
"Mr.
Frank
Churchill
writes
one
of
the
best
gentleman's
hands
I
ever
saw."
"I
do
not
admire
it,"
said
Mr.
Knightley.
"It
is
too
small
wants
strength.
It
is
like
a
woman's
writing."
This
was
not
submitted
to
by
either
lady.
They
vindicated
him
against
the
base
aspersion.
"No,
it
by
no
means
wanted
strength
it
was
not
a
large
hand,
but
very
clear
and
certainly
strong.
Had
not
Mrs.
Weston
any
letter
about
her
to
produce?"
No,
she
had
heard
from
him
very
lately,
but
having
answered
the
letter,
had
put
it
away.
"If
we
were
in
the
other
room,"
said
Emma,
"if
I
had
my
writing
desk,
I
am
sure
I
could
produce
a
specimen.
I
have
a
note
of
his.
Do
not
you
remember,
Mrs.
Weston,
employing
him
to
write
for
you
one
day?"
"He
chose
to
say
he
was
employed"
"Well,
well,
I
have
that
note;
and
can
shew
it
after
dinner
to
convince
Mr.
Knightley."
"Oh!
when
a
gallant
young
man,
like
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
dryly,
"writes
to
a
fair
lady
like
Miss
Woodhouse,
he
will,
of
course,
put
forth
his
best."
Dinner
was
on
table.
Mrs.
Elton,
before
she
could
be
spoken
to,
was
ready;
and
before
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
reached
her
with
his
request
to
be
allowed
to
hand
her
into
the
dining
parlour,
was
saying
"Must
I
go
first?
I
really
am
ashamed
of
always
leading
the
way."
Jane's
solicitude
about
fetching
her
own
letters
had
not
escaped
Emma.
She
had
heard
and
seen
it
