so
admired,
nothing
could
be
like
it.
Everybody
said
how
well
she
looked;
and
Mr.
Bingley
thought
her
quite
beautiful,
and
danced
with
her
twice!
Only
think
of
that,
my
dear;
he
actually
danced
with
her
twice!
and
she
was
the
only
creature
in
the
room
that
he
asked
a
second
time.
First
of
all,
he
asked
Miss
Lucas.
I
was
so
vexed
to
see
him
stand
up
with
her!
But,
however,
he
did
not
admire
her
at
all;
indeed,
nobody
can,
you
know;
and
he
seemed
quite
struck
with
Jane
as
she
was
going
down
the
dance.
So
he
inquired
who
she
was,
and
got
introduced,
and
asked
her
for
the
two
next.
Then
the
two
third
he
danced
with
Miss
King,
and
the
two
fourth
with
Maria
Lucas,
and
the
two
fifth
with
Jane
again,
and
the
two
sixth
with
Lizzy,
and
the
Boulanger
"
"If
he
had
had
any
compassion
for
me,"
cried
her
husband
impatiently,
"he
would
not
have
danced
half
so
much!
For
God's
sake,
say
no
more
of
his
partners.
Oh
that
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
in
the
first
dance!"
"Oh!
my
dear,
I
am
quite
delighted
with
him.
He
is
so
excessively
handsome!
And
his
sisters
are
charming
women.
I
never
in
my
life
saw
anything
more
elegant
than
their
dresses.
I
dare
say
the
lace
upon
Mrs.
Hurst's
gown
"
Here
she
was
interrupted
again.
Mr.
Bennet
protested
against
any
description
of
finery.
She
was
therefore
obliged
to
seek
another
branch
of
the
subject,
and
related,
with
much
bitterness
of
spirit
and
some
exaggeration,
the
shocking
rudeness
of
Mr.
Darcy.
"But
I
can
assure
you,"
she
added,
"that
Lizzy
does
not
lose
much
by
not
suiting
his
fancy;
for
he
is
a
most
disagreeable,
horrid
man,
not
at
all
worth
pleasing.
So
high
and
so
conceited
that
there
was
no
enduring
him!
He
walked
here,
and
he
walked
there,
fancying
himself
so
very
great!
Not
handsome
enough
to
dance
with!
I
wish
you
had
been
there,
my
dear,
to
have
given
him
one
of
your
set
downs.
I
quite
detest
the
man."
When
Jane
and
Elizabeth
were
alone,
the
former,
who
had
been
cautious
in
her
praise
of
Mr.
Bingley
before,
expressed
to
her
sister
just
how
very
much
she
admired
him.
"He
is
just
what
a
young
man
ought
to
be,"
said
she,
"sensible,
good
humoured,
lively;
and
I
never
saw
such
happy
manners!
so
much
ease,
with
such
perfect
good
breeding!"
"He
is
also
handsome,"
replied
Elizabeth,
"which
a
young
man
ought
likewise
to
be,
if
he
possibly
can.
His
character
is
thereby
complete."
"I
was
very
much
flattered
by
his
asking
me
to
dance
a
second
time.
I
did
not
expect
such
a
compliment."
"Did
not
you?
I
did
for
you.
But
that
is
one
great
difference
between
us.
Compliments
always
take
you
by
surprise,
and
me
never.
What
could
be
more
natural
than
his
asking
you
again?
He
could
not
help
seeing
that
you
were
about
five
