acquaintance.
Hartfield
will
only
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
all
the
other
places
she
belongs
to.
She
will
grow
just
refined
enough
to
be
uncomfortable
with
those
among
whom
birth
and
circumstances
have
placed
her
home.
I
am
much
mistaken
if
Emma's
doctrines
give
any
strength
of
mind,
or
tend
at
all
to
make
a
girl
adapt
herself
rationally
to
the
varieties
of
her
situation
in
life.
They
only
give
a
little
polish."
"I
either
depend
more
upon
Emma's
good
sense
than
you
do,
or
am
more
anxious
for
her
present
comfort;
for
I
cannot
lament
the
acquaintance.
How
well
she
looked
last
night!"
"Oh!
you
would
rather
talk
of
her
person
than
her
mind,
would
you?
Very
well;
I
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
Emma's
being
pretty."
"Pretty!
say
beautiful
rather.
Can
you
imagine
any
thing
nearer
perfect
beauty
than
Emma
altogether
face
and
figure?"
"I
do
not
know
what
I
could
imagine,
but
I
confess
that
I
have
seldom
seen
a
face
or
figure
more
pleasing
to
me
than
hers.
But
I
am
a
partial
old
friend."
"Such
an
eye!
the
true
hazle
eye
and
so
brilliant!
regular
features,
open
countenance,
with
a
complexion!
oh!
what
a
bloom
of
full
health,
and
such
a
pretty
height
and
size;
such
a
firm
and
upright
figure!
There
is
health,
not
merely
in
her
bloom,
but
in
her
air,
her
head,
her
glance.
One
hears
sometimes
of
a
child
being
'the
picture
of
health;'
now,
Emma
always
gives
me
the
idea
of
being
the
complete
picture
of
grown
up
health.
She
is
loveliness
itself.
Mr.
Knightley,
is
not
she?"
"I
have
not
a
fault
to
find
with
her
person,"
he
replied.
"I
think
her
all
you
describe.
I
love
to
look
at
her;
and
I
will
add
this
praise,
that
I
do
not
think
her
personally
vain.
Considering
how
very
handsome
she
is,
she
appears
to
be
little
occupied
with
it;
her
vanity
lies
another
way.
Mrs.
Weston,
I
am
not
to
be
talked
out
of
my
dislike
of
Harriet
Smith,
or
my
dread
of
its
doing
them
both
harm."
"And
I,
Mr.
Knightley,
am
equally
stout
in
my
confidence
of
its
not
doing
them
any
harm.
With
all
dear
Emma's
little
faults,
she
is
an
excellent
creature.
Where
shall
we
see
a
better
daughter,
or
a
kinder
sister,
or
a
truer
friend?
No,
no;
she
has
qualities
which
may
be
trusted;
she
will
never
lead
any
one
really
wrong;
she
will
make
no
lasting
blunder;
where
Emma
errs
once,
she
is
in
the
right
a
hundred
times."
"Very
well;
I
will
not
plague
you
any
more.
Emma
shall
be
an
angel,
and
I
will
keep
my
spleen
to
myself
till
Christmas
brings
John
and
Isabella.
John
loves
Emma
with
a
reasonable
and
therefore
not
a
blind
affection,
and
Isabella
always
thinks
as
he
does;
except
when
he
is
not
quite
frightened
enough
about
the
children.
I
am
sure
of
having
their
opinions
with
me."
"I
know
that
you
all
