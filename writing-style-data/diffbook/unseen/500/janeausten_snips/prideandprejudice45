Jane's
introduction
of
him.
She
received
him
with
her
very
best
politeness,
which
he
returned
with
as
much
more,
apologising
for
his
intrusion,
without
any
previous
acquaintance
with
her,
which
he
could
not
help
flattering
himself,
however,
might
be
justified
by
his
relationship
to
the
young
ladies
who
introduced
him
to
her
notice.
Mrs.
Phillips
was
quite
awed
by
such
an
excess
of
good
breeding;
but
her
contemplation
of
one
stranger
was
soon
put
to
an
end
by
exclamations
and
inquiries
about
the
other;
of
whom,
however,
she
could
only
tell
her
nieces
what
they
already
knew,
that
Mr.
Denny
had
brought
him
from
London,
and
that
he
was
to
have
a
lieutenant's
commission
in
the
shire.
She
had
been
watching
him
the
last
hour,
she
said,
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
street,
and
had
Mr.
Wickham
appeared,
Kitty
and
Lydia
would
certainly
have
continued
the
occupation,
but
unluckily
no
one
passed
windows
now
except
a
few
of
the
officers,
who,
in
comparison
with
the
stranger,
were
become
"stupid,
disagreeable
fellows."
Some
of
them
were
to
dine
with
the
Phillipses
the
next
day,
and
their
aunt
promised
to
make
her
husband
call
on
Mr.
Wickham,
and
give
him
an
invitation
also,
if
the
family
from
Longbourn
would
come
in
the
evening.
This
was
agreed
to,
and
Mrs.
Phillips
protested
that
they
would
have
a
nice
comfortable
noisy
game
of
lottery
tickets,
and
a
little
bit
of
hot
supper
afterwards.
The
prospect
of
such
delights
was
very
cheering,
and
they
parted
in
mutual
good
spirits.
Mr.
Collins
repeated
his
apologies
in
quitting
the
room,
and
was
assured
with
unwearying
civility
that
they
were
perfectly
needless.
As
they
walked
home,
Elizabeth
related
to
Jane
what
she
had
seen
pass
between
the
two
gentlemen;
but
though
Jane
would
have
defended
either
or
both,
had
they
appeared
to
be
in
the
wrong,
she
could
no
more
explain
such
behaviour
than
her
sister.
Mr.
Collins
on
his
return
highly
gratified
Mrs.
Bennet
by
admiring
Mrs.
Phillips's
manners
and
politeness.
He
protested
that,
except
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter,
he
had
never
seen
a
more
elegant
woman;
for
she
had
not
only
received
him
with
the
utmost
civility,
but
even
pointedly
included
him
in
her
invitation
for
the
next
evening,
although
utterly
unknown
to
her
before.
Something,
he
supposed,
might
be
attributed
to
his
connection
with
them,
but
yet
he
had
never
met
with
so
much
attention
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life.
As
no
objection
was
made
to
the
young
people's
engagement
with
their
aunt,
and
all
Mr.
Collins's
scruples
of
leaving
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bennet
for
a
single
evening
during
his
visit
were
most
steadily
resisted,
the
coach
conveyed
him
and
his
five
cousins
at
a
suitable
hour
to
Meryton;
and
the
girls
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing,
as
they
entered
the
drawing
room,
that
Mr.
Wickham
had
accepted
their
uncle's
invitation,
and
was
then
in
the
house.
When
this
information
was
given,
and
they
had
all
taken
their
seats,
Mr.
