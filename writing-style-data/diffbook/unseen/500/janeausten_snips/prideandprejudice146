herself,
moreover,
she
had
a
fresh
source
of
displeasure,
for
the
inclination
he
soon
testified
of
renewing
those
intentions
which
had
marked
the
early
part
of
their
acquaintance
could
only
serve,
after
what
had
since
passed,
to
provoke
her.
She
lost
all
concern
for
him
in
finding
herself
thus
selected
as
the
object
of
such
idle
and
frivolous
gallantry;
and
while
she
steadily
repressed
it,
could
not
but
feel
the
reproof
contained
in
his
believing,
that
however
long,
and
for
whatever
cause,
his
attentions
had
been
withdrawn,
her
vanity
would
be
gratified,
and
her
preference
secured
at
any
time
by
their
renewal.
On
the
very
last
day
of
the
regiment's
remaining
at
Meryton,
he
dined,
with
other
of
the
officers,
at
Longbourn;
and
so
little
was
Elizabeth
disposed
to
part
from
him
in
good
humour,
that
on
his
making
some
inquiry
as
to
the
manner
in
which
her
time
had
passed
at
Hunsford,
she
mentioned
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's
and
Mr.
Darcy's
having
both
spent
three
weeks
at
Rosings,
and
asked
him,
if
he
was
acquainted
with
the
former.
He
looked
surprised,
displeased,
alarmed;
but
with
a
moment's
recollection
and
a
returning
smile,
replied,
that
he
had
formerly
seen
him
often;
and,
after
observing
that
he
was
a
very
gentlemanlike
man,
asked
her
how
she
had
liked
him.
Her
answer
was
warmly
in
his
favour.
With
an
air
of
indifference
he
soon
afterwards
added:
"How
long
did
you
say
he
was
at
Rosings?"
"Nearly
three
weeks."
"And
you
saw
him
frequently?"
"Yes,
almost
every
day."
"His
manners
are
very
different
from
his
cousin's."
"Yes,
very
different.
But
I
think
Mr.
Darcy
improves
upon
acquaintance."
"Indeed!"
cried
Mr.
Wickham
with
a
look
which
did
not
escape
her.
"And
pray,
may
I
ask?
"
But
checking
himself,
he
added,
in
a
gayer
tone,
"Is
it
in
address
that
he
improves?
Has
he
deigned
to
add
aught
of
civility
to
his
ordinary
style?
for
I
dare
not
hope,"
he
continued
in
a
lower
and
more
serious
tone,
"that
he
is
improved
in
essentials."
"Oh,
no!"
said
Elizabeth.
"In
essentials,
I
believe,
he
is
very
much
what
he
ever
was."
While
she
spoke,
Wickham
looked
as
if
scarcely
knowing
whether
to
rejoice
over
her
words,
or
to
distrust
their
meaning.
There
was
a
something
in
her
countenance
which
made
him
listen
with
an
apprehensive
and
anxious
attention,
while
she
added:
"When
I
said
that
he
improved
on
acquaintance,
I
did
not
mean
that
his
mind
or
his
manners
were
in
a
state
of
improvement,
but
that,
from
knowing
him
better,
his
disposition
was
better
understood."
Wickham's
alarm
now
appeared
in
a
heightened
complexion
and
agitated
look;
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
silent,
till,
shaking
off
his
embarrassment,
he
turned
to
her
again,
and
said
in
the
gentlest
of
accents:
"You,
who
so
well
know
my
feeling
towards
Mr.
Darcy,
will
readily
comprehend
how
sincerely
I
must
rejoice
that
he
is
wise
enough
to
assume
even
the
appearance
of
what
is
right.
His
pride,
in
that
