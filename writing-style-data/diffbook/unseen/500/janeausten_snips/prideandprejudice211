distressed
to
a
most
painful
degree
by
a
distinction
so
ill
applied.
Darcy,
after
inquiring
of
her
how
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
did,
a
question
which
she
could
not
answer
without
confusion,
said
scarcely
anything.
He
was
not
seated
by
her;
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
of
his
silence;
but
it
had
not
been
so
in
Derbyshire.
There
he
had
talked
to
her
friends,
when
he
could
not
to
herself.
But
now
several
minutes
elapsed
without
bringing
the
sound
of
his
voice;
and
when
occasionally,
unable
to
resist
the
impulse
of
curiosity,
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face,
she
as
often
found
him
looking
at
Jane
as
at
herself,
and
frequently
on
no
object
but
the
ground.
More
thoughtfulness
and
less
anxiety
to
please,
than
when
they
last
met,
were
plainly
expressed.
She
was
disappointed,
and
angry
with
herself
for
being
so.
"Could
I
expect
it
to
be
otherwise!"
said
she.
"Yet
why
did
he
come?"
She
was
in
no
humour
for
conversation
with
anyone
but
himself;
and
to
him
she
had
hardly
courage
to
speak.
She
inquired
after
his
sister,
but
could
do
no
more.
"It
is
a
long
time,
Mr.
Bingley,
since
you
went
away,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet.
He
readily
agreed
to
it.
"I
began
to
be
afraid
you
would
never
come
back
again.
People
did
say
you
meant
to
quit
the
place
entirely
at
Michaelmas;
but,
however,
I
hope
it
is
not
true.
A
great
many
changes
have
happened
in
the
neighbourhood,
since
you
went
away.
Miss
Lucas
is
married
and
settled.
And
one
of
my
own
daughters.
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
it;
indeed,
you
must
have
seen
it
in
the
papers.
It
was
in
The
Times
and
The
Courier,
I
know;
though
it
was
not
put
in
as
it
ought
to
be.
It
was
only
said,
'Lately,
George
Wickham,
Esq.
to
Miss
Lydia
Bennet,'
without
there
being
a
syllable
said
of
her
father,
or
the
place
where
she
lived,
or
anything.
It
was
my
brother
Gardiner's
drawing
up
too,
and
I
wonder
how
he
came
to
make
such
an
awkward
business
of
it.
Did
you
see
it?"
Bingley
replied
that
he
did,
and
made
his
congratulations.
Elizabeth
dared
not
lift
up
her
eyes.
How
Mr.
Darcy
looked,
therefore,
she
could
not
tell.
"It
is
a
delightful
thing,
to
be
sure,
to
have
a
daughter
well
married,"
continued
her
mother,
"but
at
the
same
time,
Mr.
Bingley,
it
is
very
hard
to
have
her
taken
such
a
way
from
me.
They
are
gone
down
to
Newcastle,
a
place
quite
northward,
it
seems,
and
there
they
are
to
stay
I
do
not
know
how
long.
His
regiment
is
there;
for
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
his
leaving
the
shire,
and
of
his
being
gone
into
the
regulars.
Thank
Heaven!
he
has
some
friends,
though
perhaps
not
so
many
as
he
deserves."
Elizabeth,
who
knew
this
to
be
levelled
at
Mr.
Darcy,
was
in
such
misery
of
shame,
that
she
could
hardly
keep
her
seat.
