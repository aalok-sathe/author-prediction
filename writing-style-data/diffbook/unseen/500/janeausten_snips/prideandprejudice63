very
little
entreaty,
preparing
to
oblige
the
company.
By
many
significant
looks
and
silent
entreaties,
did
she
endeavour
to
prevent
such
a
proof
of
complaisance,
but
in
vain;
Mary
would
not
understand
them;
such
an
opportunity
of
exhibiting
was
delightful
to
her,
and
she
began
her
song.
Elizabeth's
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
with
most
painful
sensations,
and
she
watched
her
progress
through
the
several
stanzas
with
an
impatience
which
was
very
ill
rewarded
at
their
close;
for
Mary,
on
receiving,
amongst
the
thanks
of
the
table,
the
hint
of
a
hope
that
she
might
be
prevailed
on
to
favour
them
again,
after
the
pause
of
half
a
minute
began
another.
Mary's
powers
were
by
no
means
fitted
for
such
a
display;
her
voice
was
weak,
and
her
manner
affected.
Elizabeth
was
in
agonies.
She
looked
at
Jane,
to
see
how
she
bore
it;
but
Jane
was
very
composedly
talking
to
Bingley.
She
looked
at
his
two
sisters,
and
saw
them
making
signs
of
derision
at
each
other,
and
at
Darcy,
who
continued,
however,
imperturbably
grave.
She
looked
at
her
father
to
entreat
his
interference,
lest
Mary
should
be
singing
all
night.
He
took
the
hint,
and
when
Mary
had
finished
her
second
song,
said
aloud,
"That
will
do
extremely
well,
child.
You
have
delighted
us
long
enough.
Let
the
other
young
ladies
have
time
to
exhibit."
Mary,
though
pretending
not
to
hear,
was
somewhat
disconcerted;
and
Elizabeth,
sorry
for
her,
and
sorry
for
her
father's
speech,
was
afraid
her
anxiety
had
done
no
good.
Others
of
the
party
were
now
applied
to.
"If
I,"
said
Mr.
Collins,
"were
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
sing,
I
should
have
great
pleasure,
I
am
sure,
in
obliging
the
company
with
an
air;
for
I
consider
music
as
a
very
innocent
diversion,
and
perfectly
compatible
with
the
profession
of
a
clergyman.
I
do
not
mean,
however,
to
assert
that
we
can
be
justified
in
devoting
too
much
of
our
time
to
music,
for
there
are
certainly
other
things
to
be
attended
to.
The
rector
of
a
parish
has
much
to
do.
In
the
first
place,
he
must
make
such
an
agreement
for
tithes
as
may
be
beneficial
to
himself
and
not
offensive
to
his
patron.
He
must
write
his
own
sermons;
and
the
time
that
remains
will
not
be
too
much
for
his
parish
duties,
and
the
care
and
improvement
of
his
dwelling,
which
he
cannot
be
excused
from
making
as
comfortable
as
possible.
And
I
do
not
think
it
of
light
importance
that
he
should
have
attentive
and
conciliatory
manners
towards
everybody,
especially
towards
those
to
whom
he
owes
his
preferment.
I
cannot
acquit
him
of
that
duty;
nor
could
I
think
well
of
the
man
who
should
omit
an
occasion
of
testifying
his
respect
towards
anybody
connected
with
the
family."
And
with
a
bow
to
Mr.
Darcy,
he
concluded
his
speech,
which
had
been
spoken
so
loud
as
to
be
heard
by
half
the
room.
Many
stared
many
smiled;
