had;
he
had
brought
them
all
and
now
his
master
had
not
one
left
to
bake
or
boil.
William
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
himself,
he
was
so
pleased
to
think
his
master
had
sold
so
many;
for
William,
you
know,
thinks
more
of
his
master's
profit
than
any
thing;
but
Mrs.
Hodges,
he
said,
was
quite
displeased
at
their
being
all
sent
away.
She
could
not
bear
that
her
master
should
not
be
able
to
have
another
apple
tart
this
spring.
He
told
Patty
this,
but
bid
her
not
mind
it,
and
be
sure
not
to
say
any
thing
to
us
about
it,
for
Mrs.
Hodges
would
be
cross
sometimes,
and
as
long
as
so
many
sacks
were
sold,
it
did
not
signify
who
ate
the
remainder.
And
so
Patty
told
me,
and
I
was
excessively
shocked
indeed!
I
would
not
have
Mr.
Knightley
know
any
thing
about
it
for
the
world!
He
would
be
so
very....
I
wanted
to
keep
it
from
Jane's
knowledge;
but,
unluckily,
I
had
mentioned
it
before
I
was
aware."
Miss
Bates
had
just
done
as
Patty
opened
the
door;
and
her
visitors
walked
upstairs
without
having
any
regular
narration
to
attend
to,
pursued
only
by
the
sounds
of
her
desultory
good
will.
"Pray
take
care,
Mrs.
Weston,
there
is
a
step
at
the
turning.
Pray
take
care,
Miss
Woodhouse,
ours
is
rather
a
dark
staircase
rather
darker
and
narrower
than
one
could
wish.
Miss
Smith,
pray
take
care.
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
am
quite
concerned,
I
am
sure
you
hit
your
foot.
Miss
Smith,
the
step
at
the
turning."
The
appearance
of
the
little
sitting
room
as
they
entered,
was
tranquillity
itself;
Mrs.
Bates,
deprived
of
her
usual
employment,
slumbering
on
one
side
of
the
fire,
Frank
Churchill,
at
a
table
near
her,
most
deedily
occupied
about
her
spectacles,
and
Jane
Fairfax,
standing
with
her
back
to
them,
intent
on
her
pianoforte.
Busy
as
he
was,
however,
the
young
man
was
yet
able
to
shew
a
most
happy
countenance
on
seeing
Emma
again.
"This
is
a
pleasure,"
said
he,
in
rather
a
low
voice,
"coming
at
least
ten
minutes
earlier
than
I
had
calculated.
You
find
me
trying
to
be
useful;
tell
me
if
you
think
I
shall
succeed."
"What!"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"have
not
you
finished
it
yet?
you
would
not
earn
a
very
good
livelihood
as
a
working
silversmith
at
this
rate."
"I
have
not
been
working
uninterruptedly,"
he
replied,
"I
have
been
assisting
Miss
Fairfax
in
trying
to
make
her
instrument
stand
steadily,
it
was
not
quite
firm;
an
unevenness
in
the
floor,
I
believe.
You
see
we
have
been
wedging
one
leg
with
paper.
This
was
very
kind
of
you
to
be
persuaded
to
come.
I
was
almost
afraid
you
would
be
hurrying
home."
He
contrived
that
she
should
be
seated
by
him;
and
was
sufficiently
employed
in
looking
out
the
best
baked
apple
for
her,
and
trying
to
make
her
help
or
advise
him
in
his
work,
till
