her
manner
varied,
however,
her
determination
never
did.
Mr.
Collins,
meanwhile,
was
meditating
in
solitude
on
what
had
passed.
He
thought
too
well
of
himself
to
comprehend
on
what
motives
his
cousin
could
refuse
him;
and
though
his
pride
was
hurt,
he
suffered
in
no
other
way.
His
regard
for
her
was
quite
imaginary;
and
the
possibility
of
her
deserving
her
mother's
reproach
prevented
his
feeling
any
regret.
While
the
family
were
in
this
confusion,
Charlotte
Lucas
came
to
spend
the
day
with
them.
She
was
met
in
the
vestibule
by
Lydia,
who,
flying
to
her,
cried
in
a
half
whisper,
"I
am
glad
you
are
come,
for
there
is
such
fun
here!
What
do
you
think
has
happened
this
morning?
Mr.
Collins
has
made
an
offer
to
Lizzy,
and
she
will
not
have
him."
Charlotte
hardly
had
time
to
answer,
before
they
were
joined
by
Kitty,
who
came
to
tell
the
same
news;
and
no
sooner
had
they
entered
the
breakfast
room,
where
Mrs.
Bennet
was
alone,
than
she
likewise
began
on
the
subject,
calling
on
Miss
Lucas
for
her
compassion,
and
entreating
her
to
persuade
her
friend
Lizzy
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
all
her
family.
"Pray
do,
my
dear
Miss
Lucas,"
she
added
in
a
melancholy
tone,
"for
nobody
is
on
my
side,
nobody
takes
part
with
me.
I
am
cruelly
used,
nobody
feels
for
my
poor
nerves."
Charlotte's
reply
was
spared
by
the
entrance
of
Jane
and
Elizabeth.
"Aye,
there
she
comes,"
continued
Mrs.
Bennet,
"looking
as
unconcerned
as
may
be,
and
caring
no
more
for
us
than
if
we
were
at
York,
provided
she
can
have
her
own
way.
But
I
tell
you,
Miss
Lizzy
if
you
take
it
into
your
head
to
go
on
refusing
every
offer
of
marriage
in
this
way,
you
will
never
get
a
husband
at
all
and
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
who
is
to
maintain
you
when
your
father
is
dead.
I
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
you
and
so
I
warn
you.
I
have
done
with
you
from
this
very
day.
I
told
you
in
the
library,
you
know,
that
I
should
never
speak
to
you
again,
and
you
will
find
me
as
good
as
my
word.
I
have
no
pleasure
in
talking
to
undutiful
children.
Not
that
I
have
much
pleasure,
indeed,
in
talking
to
anybody.
People
who
suffer
as
I
do
from
nervous
complaints
can
have
no
great
inclination
for
talking.
Nobody
can
tell
what
I
suffer!
But
it
is
always
so.
Those
who
do
not
complain
are
never
pitied."
Her
daughters
listened
in
silence
to
this
effusion,
sensible
that
any
attempt
to
reason
with
her
or
soothe
her
would
only
increase
the
irritation.
She
talked
on,
therefore,
without
interruption
from
any
of
them,
till
they
were
joined
by
Mr.
Collins,
who
entered
the
room
with
an
air
more
stately
than
usual,
and
on
perceiving
whom,
she
said
to
the
girls,
"Now,
I
do
insist
upon
it,
that
you,
all
of
you,
