fancy
a
proper
direction
and
raised
the
gratitude
of
her
young
vanity
to
a
very
good
purpose,
for
she
found
her
decidedly
more
sensible
than
before
of
Mr.
Elton's
being
a
remarkably
handsome
man,
with
most
agreeable
manners;
and
as
she
had
no
hesitation
in
following
up
the
assurance
of
his
admiration
by
agreeable
hints,
she
was
soon
pretty
confident
of
creating
as
much
liking
on
Harriet's
side,
as
there
could
be
any
occasion
for.
She
was
quite
convinced
of
Mr.
Elton's
being
in
the
fairest
way
of
falling
in
love,
if
not
in
love
already.
She
had
no
scruple
with
regard
to
him.
He
talked
of
Harriet,
and
praised
her
so
warmly,
that
she
could
not
suppose
any
thing
wanting
which
a
little
time
would
not
add.
His
perception
of
the
striking
improvement
of
Harriet's
manner,
since
her
introduction
at
Hartfield,
was
not
one
of
the
least
agreeable
proofs
of
his
growing
attachment.
"You
have
given
Miss
Smith
all
that
she
required,"
said
he;
"you
have
made
her
graceful
and
easy.
She
was
a
beautiful
creature
when
she
came
to
you,
but,
in
my
opinion,
the
attractions
you
have
added
are
infinitely
superior
to
what
she
received
from
nature."
"I
am
glad
you
think
I
have
been
useful
to
her;
but
Harriet
only
wanted
drawing
out,
and
receiving
a
few,
very
few
hints.
She
had
all
the
natural
grace
of
sweetness
of
temper
and
artlessness
in
herself.
I
have
done
very
little."
"If
it
were
admissible
to
contradict
a
lady,"
said
the
gallant
Mr.
Elton
"I
have
perhaps
given
her
a
little
more
decision
of
character,
have
taught
her
to
think
on
points
which
had
not
fallen
in
her
way
before."
"Exactly
so;
that
is
what
principally
strikes
me.
So
much
superadded
decision
of
character!
Skilful
has
been
the
hand!"
"Great
has
been
the
pleasure,
I
am
sure.
I
never
met
with
a
disposition
more
truly
amiable."
"I
have
no
doubt
of
it."
And
it
was
spoken
with
a
sort
of
sighing
animation,
which
had
a
vast
deal
of
the
lover.
She
was
not
less
pleased
another
day
with
the
manner
in
which
he
seconded
a
sudden
wish
of
hers,
to
have
Harriet's
picture.
"Did
you
ever
have
your
likeness
taken,
Harriet?"
said
she:
"did
you
ever
sit
for
your
picture?"
Harriet
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room,
and
only
stopt
to
say,
with
a
very
interesting
naivete,
"Oh!
dear,
no,
never."
No
sooner
was
she
out
of
sight,
than
Emma
exclaimed,
"What
an
exquisite
possession
a
good
picture
of
her
would
be!
I
would
give
any
money
for
it.
I
almost
long
to
attempt
her
likeness
myself.
You
do
not
know
it
I
dare
say,
but
two
or
three
years
ago
I
had
a
great
passion
for
taking
likenesses,
and
attempted
several
of
my
friends,
and
was
thought
to
have
a
tolerable
eye
in
general.
But
from
one
cause
or
another,
I
gave
it
up
in
disgust.
But
really,
I
could
almost
venture,
if
Harriet
would
