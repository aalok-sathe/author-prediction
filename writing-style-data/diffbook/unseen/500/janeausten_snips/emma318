had
none."
"I
never
had
the
smallest,
I
assure
you."
"That
appears
quite
wonderful.
I
was
once
very
near
and
I
wish
I
had
it
would
have
been
better.
But
though
I
was
always
doing
wrong
things,
they
were
very
bad
wrong
things,
and
such
as
did
me
no
service.
It
would
have
been
a
much
better
transgression
had
I
broken
the
bond
of
secrecy
and
told
you
every
thing."
"It
is
not
now
worth
a
regret,"
said
Emma.
"I
have
some
hope,"
resumed
he,
"of
my
uncle's
being
persuaded
to
pay
a
visit
at
Randalls;
he
wants
to
be
introduced
to
her.
When
the
Campbells
are
returned,
we
shall
meet
them
in
London,
and
continue
there,
I
trust,
till
we
may
carry
her
northward.
But
now,
I
am
at
such
a
distance
from
her
is
not
it
hard,
Miss
Woodhouse?
Till
this
morning,
we
have
not
once
met
since
the
day
of
reconciliation.
Do
not
you
pity
me?"
Emma
spoke
her
pity
so
very
kindly,
that
with
a
sudden
accession
of
gay
thought,
he
cried,
"Ah!
by
the
bye,"
then
sinking
his
voice,
and
looking
demure
for
the
moment
"I
hope
Mr.
Knightley
is
well?"
He
paused.
She
coloured
and
laughed.
"I
know
you
saw
my
letter,
and
think
you
may
remember
my
wish
in
your
favour.
Let
me
return
your
congratulations.
I
assure
you
that
I
have
heard
the
news
with
the
warmest
interest
and
satisfaction.
He
is
a
man
whom
I
cannot
presume
to
praise."
Emma
was
delighted,
and
only
wanted
him
to
go
on
in
the
same
style;
but
his
mind
was
the
next
moment
in
his
own
concerns
and
with
his
own
Jane,
and
his
next
words
were,
"Did
you
ever
see
such
a
skin?
such
smoothness!
such
delicacy!
and
yet
without
being
actually
fair.
One
cannot
call
her
fair.
It
is
a
most
uncommon
complexion,
with
her
dark
eye
lashes
and
hair
a
most
distinguishing
complexion!
So
peculiarly
the
lady
in
it.
Just
colour
enough
for
beauty."
"I
have
always
admired
her
complexion,"
replied
Emma,
archly;
"but
do
not
I
remember
the
time
when
you
found
fault
with
her
for
being
so
pale?
When
we
first
began
to
talk
of
her.
Have
you
quite
forgotten?"
"Oh!
no
what
an
impudent
dog
I
was!
How
could
I
dare
"
But
he
laughed
so
heartily
at
the
recollection,
that
Emma
could
not
help
saying,
"I
do
suspect
that
in
the
midst
of
your
perplexities
at
that
time,
you
had
very
great
amusement
in
tricking
us
all.
I
am
sure
you
had.
I
am
sure
it
was
a
consolation
to
you."
"Oh!
no,
no,
no
how
can
you
suspect
me
of
such
a
thing?
I
was
the
most
miserable
wretch!"
"Not
quite
so
miserable
as
to
be
insensible
to
mirth.
I
am
sure
it
was
a
source
of
high
entertainment
to
you,
to
feel
that
you
were
taking
us
all
in.
Perhaps
I
am
the
readier
to
suspect,
because,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
I
think
it
