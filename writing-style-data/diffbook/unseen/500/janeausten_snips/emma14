listening,
and
forming
all
these
schemes
in
the
in
betweens,
that
the
evening
flew
away
at
a
very
unusual
rate;
and
the
supper
table,
which
always
closed
such
parties,
and
for
which
she
had
been
used
to
sit
and
watch
the
due
time,
was
all
set
out
and
ready,
and
moved
forwards
to
the
fire,
before
she
was
aware.
With
an
alacrity
beyond
the
common
impulse
of
a
spirit
which
yet
was
never
indifferent
to
the
credit
of
doing
every
thing
well
and
attentively,
with
the
real
good
will
of
a
mind
delighted
with
its
own
ideas,
did
she
then
do
all
the
honours
of
the
meal,
and
help
and
recommend
the
minced
chicken
and
scalloped
oysters,
with
an
urgency
which
she
knew
would
be
acceptable
to
the
early
hours
and
civil
scruples
of
their
guests.
Upon
such
occasions
poor
Mr.
Woodhouse's
feelings
were
in
sad
warfare.
He
loved
to
have
the
cloth
laid,
because
it
had
been
the
fashion
of
his
youth,
but
his
conviction
of
suppers
being
very
unwholesome
made
him
rather
sorry
to
see
any
thing
put
on
it;
and
while
his
hospitality
would
have
welcomed
his
visitors
to
every
thing,
his
care
for
their
health
made
him
grieve
that
they
would
eat.
Such
another
small
basin
of
thin
gruel
as
his
own
was
all
that
he
could,
with
thorough
self
approbation,
recommend;
though
he
might
constrain
himself,
while
the
ladies
were
comfortably
clearing
the
nicer
things,
to
say:
"Mrs.
Bates,
let
me
propose
your
venturing
on
one
of
these
eggs.
An
egg
boiled
very
soft
is
not
unwholesome.
Serle
understands
boiling
an
egg
better
than
any
body.
I
would
not
recommend
an
egg
boiled
by
any
body
else;
but
you
need
not
be
afraid,
they
are
very
small,
you
see
one
of
our
small
eggs
will
not
hurt
you.
Miss
Bates,
let
Emma
help
you
to
a
little
bit
of
tart
a
very
little
bit.
Ours
are
all
apple
tarts.
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
unwholesome
preserves
here.
I
do
not
advise
the
custard.
Mrs.
Goddard,
what
say
you
to
half
a
glass
of
wine?
A
small
half
glass,
put
into
a
tumbler
of
water?
I
do
not
think
it
could
disagree
with
you."
Emma
allowed
her
father
to
talk
but
supplied
her
visitors
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
style,
and
on
the
present
evening
had
particular
pleasure
in
sending
them
away
happy.
The
happiness
of
Miss
Smith
was
quite
equal
to
her
intentions.
Miss
Woodhouse
was
so
great
a
personage
in
Highbury,
that
the
prospect
of
the
introduction
had
given
as
much
panic
as
pleasure;
but
the
humble,
grateful
little
girl
went
off
with
highly
gratified
feelings,
delighted
with
the
affability
with
which
Miss
Woodhouse
had
treated
her
all
the
evening,
and
actually
shaken
hands
with
her
at
last!
Harriet
Smith's
intimacy
at
Hartfield
was
soon
a
settled
thing.
Quick
and
decided
in
her
ways,
Emma
lost
no
time
in
inviting,
encouraging,
and
telling
her
to
come
very
often;
and
as
their
acquaintance
increased,
