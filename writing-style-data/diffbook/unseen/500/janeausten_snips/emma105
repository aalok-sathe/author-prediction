out,
quite
frightened,
with
'Bless
me!
poor
Jane
is
ill!'
which
my
mother,
being
on
the
watch,
heard
distinctly,
and
was
sadly
alarmed
at.
However,
when
I
read
on,
I
found
it
was
not
near
so
bad
as
I
had
fancied
at
first;
and
I
make
so
light
of
it
now
to
her,
that
she
does
not
think
much
about
it.
But
I
cannot
imagine
how
I
could
be
so
off
my
guard.
If
Jane
does
not
get
well
soon,
we
will
call
in
Mr.
Perry.
The
expense
shall
not
be
thought
of;
and
though
he
is
so
liberal,
and
so
fond
of
Jane
that
I
dare
say
he
would
not
mean
to
charge
any
thing
for
attendance,
we
could
not
suffer
it
to
be
so,
you
know.
He
has
a
wife
and
family
to
maintain,
and
is
not
to
be
giving
away
his
time.
Well,
now
I
have
just
given
you
a
hint
of
what
Jane
writes
about,
we
will
turn
to
her
letter,
and
I
am
sure
she
tells
her
own
story
a
great
deal
better
than
I
can
tell
it
for
her."
"I
am
afraid
we
must
be
running
away,"
said
Emma,
glancing
at
Harriet,
and
beginning
to
rise
"My
father
will
be
expecting
us.
I
had
no
intention,
I
thought
I
had
no
power
of
staying
more
than
five
minutes,
when
I
first
entered
the
house.
I
merely
called,
because
I
would
not
pass
the
door
without
inquiring
after
Mrs.
Bates;
but
I
have
been
so
pleasantly
detained!
Now,
however,
we
must
wish
you
and
Mrs.
Bates
good
morning."
And
not
all
that
could
be
urged
to
detain
her
succeeded.
She
regained
the
street
happy
in
this,
that
though
much
had
been
forced
on
her
against
her
will,
though
she
had
in
fact
heard
the
whole
substance
of
Jane
Fairfax's
letter,
she
had
been
able
to
escape
the
letter
itself.
Jane
Fairfax
was
an
orphan,
the
only
child
of
Mrs.
Bates's
youngest
daughter.
The
marriage
of
Lieut.
Fairfax
of
the
regiment
of
infantry,
and
Miss
Jane
Bates,
had
had
its
day
of
fame
and
pleasure,
hope
and
interest;
but
nothing
now
remained
of
it,
save
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
him
dying
in
action
abroad
of
his
widow
sinking
under
consumption
and
grief
soon
afterwards
and
this
girl.
By
birth
she
belonged
to
Highbury:
and
when
at
three
years
old,
on
losing
her
mother,
she
became
the
property,
the
charge,
the
consolation,
the
foundling
of
her
grandmother
and
aunt,
there
had
seemed
every
probability
of
her
being
permanently
fixed
there;
of
her
being
taught
only
what
very
limited
means
could
command,
and
growing
up
with
no
advantages
of
connexion
or
improvement,
to
be
engrafted
on
what
nature
had
given
her
in
a
pleasing
person,
good
understanding,
and
warm
hearted,
well
meaning
relations.
But
the
compassionate
feelings
of
a
friend
of
her
father
gave
a
change
to
her
destiny.
This
was
Colonel
Campbell,
who
had
very
highly
regarded
Fairfax,
as
an
excellent
officer
and
most
deserving
young
man;
