him
again,
which
makes
this
day's
news
doubly
welcome.
It
has
been
completely
unexpected.
That
is,
I
always
had
a
strong
persuasion
he
would
be
here
again
soon,
I
was
sure
something
favourable
would
turn
up
but
nobody
believed
me.
He
and
Mrs.
Weston
were
both
dreadfully
desponding.
'How
could
he
contrive
to
come?
And
how
could
it
be
supposed
that
his
uncle
and
aunt
would
spare
him
again?'
and
so
forth
I
always
felt
that
something
would
happen
in
our
favour;
and
so
it
has,
you
see.
I
have
observed,
Mrs.
Elton,
in
the
course
of
my
life,
that
if
things
are
going
untowardly
one
month,
they
are
sure
to
mend
the
next."
"Very
true,
Mr.
Weston,
perfectly
true.
It
is
just
what
I
used
to
say
to
a
certain
gentleman
in
company
in
the
days
of
courtship,
when,
because
things
did
not
go
quite
right,
did
not
proceed
with
all
the
rapidity
which
suited
his
feelings,
he
was
apt
to
be
in
despair,
and
exclaim
that
he
was
sure
at
this
rate
it
would
be
May
before
Hymen's
saffron
robe
would
be
put
on
for
us.
Oh!
the
pains
I
have
been
at
to
dispel
those
gloomy
ideas
and
give
him
cheerfuller
views!
The
carriage
we
had
disappointments
about
the
carriage;
one
morning,
I
remember,
he
came
to
me
quite
in
despair."
She
was
stopped
by
a
slight
fit
of
coughing,
and
Mr.
Weston
instantly
seized
the
opportunity
of
going
on.
"You
were
mentioning
May.
May
is
the
very
month
which
Mrs.
Churchill
is
ordered,
or
has
ordered
herself,
to
spend
in
some
warmer
place
than
Enscombe
in
short,
to
spend
in
London;
so
that
we
have
the
agreeable
prospect
of
frequent
visits
from
Frank
the
whole
spring
precisely
the
season
of
the
year
which
one
should
have
chosen
for
it:
days
almost
at
the
longest;
weather
genial
and
pleasant,
always
inviting
one
out,
and
never
too
hot
for
exercise.
When
he
was
here
before,
we
made
the
best
of
it;
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
wet,
damp,
cheerless
weather;
there
always
is
in
February,
you
know,
and
we
could
not
do
half
that
we
intended.
Now
will
be
the
time.
This
will
be
complete
enjoyment;
and
I
do
not
know,
Mrs.
Elton,
whether
the
uncertainty
of
our
meetings,
the
sort
of
constant
expectation
there
will
be
of
his
coming
in
to
day
or
to
morrow,
and
at
any
hour,
may
not
be
more
friendly
to
happiness
than
having
him
actually
in
the
house.
I
think
it
is
so.
I
think
it
is
the
state
of
mind
which
gives
most
spirit
and
delight.
I
hope
you
will
be
pleased
with
my
son;
but
you
must
not
expect
a
prodigy.
He
is
generally
thought
a
fine
young
man,
but
do
not
expect
a
prodigy.
Mrs.
Weston's
partiality
for
him
is
very
great,
and,
as
you
may
suppose,
most
gratifying
to
me.
She
thinks
nobody
equal
to
him."
"And
I
assure
you,
Mr.
Weston,
I
have
very
little
