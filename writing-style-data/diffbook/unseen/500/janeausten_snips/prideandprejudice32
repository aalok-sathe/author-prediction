The
path
just
admitted
three.
Mr.
Darcy
felt
their
rudeness,
and
immediately
said:
"This
walk
is
not
wide
enough
for
our
party.
We
had
better
go
into
the
avenue."
But
Elizabeth,
who
had
not
the
least
inclination
to
remain
with
them,
laughingly
answered:
"No,
no;
stay
where
you
are.
You
are
charmingly
grouped,
and
appear
to
uncommon
advantage.
The
picturesque
would
be
spoilt
by
admitting
a
fourth.
Good
bye."
She
then
ran
gaily
off,
rejoicing
as
she
rambled
about,
in
the
hope
of
being
at
home
again
in
a
day
or
two.
Jane
was
already
so
much
recovered
as
to
intend
leaving
her
room
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
evening.
When
the
ladies
removed
after
dinner,
Elizabeth
ran
up
to
her
sister,
and
seeing
her
well
guarded
from
cold,
attended
her
into
the
drawing
room,
where
she
was
welcomed
by
her
two
friends
with
many
professions
of
pleasure;
and
Elizabeth
had
never
seen
them
so
agreeable
as
they
were
during
the
hour
which
passed
before
the
gentlemen
appeared.
Their
powers
of
conversation
were
considerable.
They
could
describe
an
entertainment
with
accuracy,
relate
an
anecdote
with
humour,
and
laugh
at
their
acquaintance
with
spirit.
But
when
the
gentlemen
entered,
Jane
was
no
longer
the
first
object;
Miss
Bingley's
eyes
were
instantly
turned
toward
Darcy,
and
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
before
he
had
advanced
many
steps.
He
addressed
himself
to
Miss
Bennet,
with
a
polite
congratulation;
Mr.
Hurst
also
made
her
a
slight
bow,
and
said
he
was
"very
glad;"
but
diffuseness
and
warmth
remained
for
Bingley's
salutation.
He
was
full
of
joy
and
attention.
The
first
half
hour
was
spent
in
piling
up
the
fire,
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
change
of
room;
and
she
removed
at
his
desire
to
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace,
that
she
might
be
further
from
the
door.
He
then
sat
down
by
her,
and
talked
scarcely
to
anyone
else.
Elizabeth,
at
work
in
the
opposite
corner,
saw
it
all
with
great
delight.
When
tea
was
over,
Mr.
Hurst
reminded
his
sister
in
law
of
the
card
table
but
in
vain.
She
had
obtained
private
intelligence
that
Mr.
Darcy
did
not
wish
for
cards;
and
Mr.
Hurst
soon
found
even
his
open
petition
rejected.
She
assured
him
that
no
one
intended
to
play,
and
the
silence
of
the
whole
party
on
the
subject
seemed
to
justify
her.
Mr.
Hurst
had
therefore
nothing
to
do,
but
to
stretch
himself
on
one
of
the
sofas
and
go
to
sleep.
Darcy
took
up
a
book;
Miss
Bingley
did
the
same;
and
Mrs.
Hurst,
principally
occupied
in
playing
with
her
bracelets
and
rings,
joined
now
and
then
in
her
brother's
conversation
with
Miss
Bennet.
Miss
Bingley's
attention
was
quite
as
much
engaged
in
watching
Mr.
Darcy's
progress
through
his
book,
as
in
reading
her
own;
and
she
was
perpetually
either
making
some
inquiry,
or
looking
at
his
page.
She
could
not
win
him,
however,
to
any
conversation;
he
merely
answered
her
question,
and
read
