habit
of
regard
for
every
old
acquaintance.
Mr.
John
Knightley
was
a
tall,
gentleman
like,
and
very
clever
man;
rising
in
his
profession,
domestic,
and
respectable
in
his
private
character;
but
with
reserved
manners
which
prevented
his
being
generally
pleasing;
and
capable
of
being
sometimes
out
of
humour.
He
was
not
an
ill
tempered
man,
not
so
often
unreasonably
cross
as
to
deserve
such
a
reproach;
but
his
temper
was
not
his
great
perfection;
and,
indeed,
with
such
a
worshipping
wife,
it
was
hardly
possible
that
any
natural
defects
in
it
should
not
be
increased.
The
extreme
sweetness
of
her
temper
must
hurt
his.
He
had
all
the
clearness
and
quickness
of
mind
which
she
wanted,
and
he
could
sometimes
act
an
ungracious,
or
say
a
severe
thing.
He
was
not
a
great
favourite
with
his
fair
sister
in
law.
Nothing
wrong
in
him
escaped
her.
She
was
quick
in
feeling
the
little
injuries
to
Isabella,
which
Isabella
never
felt
herself.
Perhaps
she
might
have
passed
over
more
had
his
manners
been
flattering
to
Isabella's
sister,
but
they
were
only
those
of
a
calmly
kind
brother
and
friend,
without
praise
and
without
blindness;
but
hardly
any
degree
of
personal
compliment
could
have
made
her
regardless
of
that
greatest
fault
of
all
in
her
eyes
which
he
sometimes
fell
into,
the
want
of
respectful
forbearance
towards
her
father.
There
he
had
not
always
the
patience
that
could
have
been
wished.
Mr.
Woodhouse's
peculiarities
and
fidgetiness
were
sometimes
provoking
him
to
a
rational
remonstrance
or
sharp
retort
equally
ill
bestowed.
It
did
not
often
happen;
for
Mr.
John
Knightley
had
really
a
great
regard
for
his
father
in
law,
and
generally
a
strong
sense
of
what
was
due
to
him;
but
it
was
too
often
for
Emma's
charity,
especially
as
there
was
all
the
pain
of
apprehension
frequently
to
be
endured,
though
the
offence
came
not.
The
beginning,
however,
of
every
visit
displayed
none
but
the
properest
feelings,
and
this
being
of
necessity
so
short
might
be
hoped
to
pass
away
in
unsullied
cordiality.
They
had
not
been
long
seated
and
composed
when
Mr.
Woodhouse,
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
and
a
sigh,
called
his
daughter's
attention
to
the
sad
change
at
Hartfield
since
she
had
been
there
last.
"Ah,
my
dear,"
said
he,
"poor
Miss
Taylor
It
is
a
grievous
business."
"Oh
yes,
sir,"
cried
she
with
ready
sympathy,
"how
you
must
miss
her!
And
dear
Emma,
too!
What
a
dreadful
loss
to
you
both!
I
have
been
so
grieved
for
you.
I
could
not
imagine
how
you
could
possibly
do
without
her.
It
is
a
sad
change
indeed.
But
I
hope
she
is
pretty
well,
sir."
"Pretty
well,
my
dear
I
hope
pretty
well.
I
do
not
know
but
that
the
place
agrees
with
her
tolerably."
Mr.
John
Knightley
here
asked
Emma
quietly
whether
there
were
any
doubts
of
the
air
of
Randalls.
"Oh!
no
none
in
the
least.
I
never
saw
Mrs.
Weston
better
in
my
life
