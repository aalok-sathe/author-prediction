dancing
together
at
Netherfield."
Elizabeth
was
pleased
to
find
his
memory
so
exact;
and
he
afterwards
took
occasion
to
ask
her,
when
unattended
to
by
any
of
the
rest,
whether
all
her
sisters
were
at
Longbourn.
There
was
not
much
in
the
question,
nor
in
the
preceding
remark;
but
there
was
a
look
and
a
manner
which
gave
them
meaning.
It
was
not
often
that
she
could
turn
her
eyes
on
Mr.
Darcy
himself;
but,
whenever
she
did
catch
a
glimpse,
she
saw
an
expression
of
general
complaisance,
and
in
all
that
he
said
she
heard
an
accent
so
removed
from
hauteur
or
disdain
of
his
companions,
as
convinced
her
that
the
improvement
of
manners
which
she
had
yesterday
witnessed
however
temporary
its
existence
might
prove,
had
at
least
outlived
one
day.
When
she
saw
him
thus
seeking
the
acquaintance
and
courting
the
good
opinion
of
people
with
whom
any
intercourse
a
few
months
ago
would
have
been
a
disgrace
when
she
saw
him
thus
civil,
not
only
to
herself,
but
to
the
very
relations
whom
he
had
openly
disdained,
and
recollected
their
last
lively
scene
in
Hunsford
Parsonage
the
difference,
the
change
was
so
great,
and
struck
so
forcibly
on
her
mind,
that
she
could
hardly
restrain
her
astonishment
from
being
visible.
Never,
even
in
the
company
of
his
dear
friends
at
Netherfield,
or
his
dignified
relations
at
Rosings,
had
she
seen
him
so
desirous
to
please,
so
free
from
self
consequence
or
unbending
reserve,
as
now,
when
no
importance
could
result
from
the
success
of
his
endeavours,
and
when
even
the
acquaintance
of
those
to
whom
his
attentions
were
addressed
would
draw
down
the
ridicule
and
censure
of
the
ladies
both
of
Netherfield
and
Rosings.
Their
visitors
stayed
with
them
above
half
an
hour;
and
when
they
arose
to
depart,
Mr.
Darcy
called
on
his
sister
to
join
him
in
expressing
their
wish
of
seeing
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner,
and
Miss
Bennet,
to
dinner
at
Pemberley,
before
they
left
the
country.
Miss
Darcy,
though
with
a
diffidence
which
marked
her
little
in
the
habit
of
giving
invitations,
readily
obeyed.
Mrs.
Gardiner
looked
at
her
niece,
desirous
of
knowing
how
she,
whom
the
invitation
most
concerned,
felt
disposed
as
to
its
acceptance,
but
Elizabeth
had
turned
away
her
head.
Presuming
however,
that
this
studied
avoidance
spoke
rather
a
momentary
embarrassment
than
any
dislike
of
the
proposal,
and
seeing
in
her
husband,
who
was
fond
of
society,
a
perfect
willingness
to
accept
it,
she
ventured
to
engage
for
her
attendance,
and
the
day
after
the
next
was
fixed
on.
Bingley
expressed
great
pleasure
in
the
certainty
of
seeing
Elizabeth
again,
having
still
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her,
and
many
inquiries
to
make
after
all
their
Hertfordshire
friends.
Elizabeth,
construing
all
this
into
a
wish
of
hearing
her
speak
of
her
sister,
was
pleased,
and
on
this
account,
as
well
as
some
others,
found
herself,
when
their
visitors
left
them,
capable
of
considering
the
last
half
hour
with
some
