owing
here;
but
the
intercourse
of
the
last
seven
years,
the
equal
footing
and
perfect
unreserve
which
had
soon
followed
Isabella's
marriage,
on
their
being
left
to
each
other,
was
yet
a
dearer,
tenderer
recollection.
She
had
been
a
friend
and
companion
such
as
few
possessed:
intelligent,
well
informed,
useful,
gentle,
knowing
all
the
ways
of
the
family,
interested
in
all
its
concerns,
and
peculiarly
interested
in
herself,
in
every
pleasure,
every
scheme
of
hers
one
to
whom
she
could
speak
every
thought
as
it
arose,
and
who
had
such
an
affection
for
her
as
could
never
find
fault.
How
was
she
to
bear
the
change?
It
was
true
that
her
friend
was
going
only
half
a
mile
from
them;
but
Emma
was
aware
that
great
must
be
the
difference
between
a
Mrs.
Weston,
only
half
a
mile
from
them,
and
a
Miss
Taylor
in
the
house;
and
with
all
her
advantages,
natural
and
domestic,
she
was
now
in
great
danger
of
suffering
from
intellectual
solitude.
She
dearly
loved
her
father,
but
he
was
no
companion
for
her.
He
could
not
meet
her
in
conversation,
rational
or
playful.
The
evil
of
the
actual
disparity
in
their
ages
(and
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
not
married
early)
was
much
increased
by
his
constitution
and
habits;
for
having
been
a
valetudinarian
all
his
life,
without
activity
of
mind
or
body,
he
was
a
much
older
man
in
ways
than
in
years;
and
though
everywhere
beloved
for
the
friendliness
of
his
heart
and
his
amiable
temper,
his
talents
could
not
have
recommended
him
at
any
time.
Her
sister,
though
comparatively
but
little
removed
by
matrimony,
being
settled
in
London,
only
sixteen
miles
off,
was
much
beyond
her
daily
reach;
and
many
a
long
October
and
November
evening
must
be
struggled
through
at
Hartfield,
before
Christmas
brought
the
next
visit
from
Isabella
and
her
husband,
and
their
little
children,
to
fill
the
house,
and
give
her
pleasant
society
again.
Highbury,
the
large
and
populous
village,
almost
amounting
to
a
town,
to
which
Hartfield,
in
spite
of
its
separate
lawn,
and
shrubberies,
and
name,
did
really
belong,
afforded
her
no
equals.
The
Woodhouses
were
first
in
consequence
there.
All
looked
up
to
them.
She
had
many
acquaintance
in
the
place,
for
her
father
was
universally
civil,
but
not
one
among
them
who
could
be
accepted
in
lieu
of
Miss
Taylor
for
even
half
a
day.
It
was
a
melancholy
change;
and
Emma
could
not
but
sigh
over
it,
and
wish
for
impossible
things,
till
her
father
awoke,
and
made
it
necessary
to
be
cheerful.
His
spirits
required
support.
He
was
a
nervous
man,
easily
depressed;
fond
of
every
body
that
he
was
used
to,
and
hating
to
part
with
them;
hating
change
of
every
kind.
Matrimony,
as
the
origin
of
change,
was
always
disagreeable;
and
he
was
by
no
means
yet
reconciled
to
his
own
daughter's
marrying,
nor
could
ever
speak
of
her
but
with
compassion,
though
it
had
been
entirely
a
match
of
affection,
when
he
