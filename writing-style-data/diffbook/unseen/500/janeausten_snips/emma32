for
seeming
so
pleased
and
so
doubtful.
"Upon
my
word,"
she
cried,
"the
young
man
is
determined
not
to
lose
any
thing
for
want
of
asking.
He
will
connect
himself
well
if
he
can."
"Will
you
read
the
letter?"
cried
Harriet.
"Pray
do.
I'd
rather
you
would."
Emma
was
not
sorry
to
be
pressed.
She
read,
and
was
surprized.
The
style
of
the
letter
was
much
above
her
expectation.
There
were
not
merely
no
grammatical
errors,
but
as
a
composition
it
would
not
have
disgraced
a
gentleman;
the
language,
though
plain,
was
strong
and
unaffected,
and
the
sentiments
it
conveyed
very
much
to
the
credit
of
the
writer.
It
was
short,
but
expressed
good
sense,
warm
attachment,
liberality,
propriety,
even
delicacy
of
feeling.
She
paused
over
it,
while
Harriet
stood
anxiously
watching
for
her
opinion,
with
a
"Well,
well,"
and
was
at
last
forced
to
add,
"Is
it
a
good
letter?
or
is
it
too
short?"
"Yes,
indeed,
a
very
good
letter,"
replied
Emma
rather
slowly
"so
good
a
letter,
Harriet,
that
every
thing
considered,
I
think
one
of
his
sisters
must
have
helped
him.
I
can
hardly
imagine
the
young
man
whom
I
saw
talking
with
you
the
other
day
could
express
himself
so
well,
if
left
quite
to
his
own
powers,
and
yet
it
is
not
the
style
of
a
woman;
no,
certainly,
it
is
too
strong
and
concise;
not
diffuse
enough
for
a
woman.
No
doubt
he
is
a
sensible
man,
and
I
suppose
may
have
a
natural
talent
for
thinks
strongly
and
clearly
and
when
he
takes
a
pen
in
hand,
his
thoughts
naturally
find
proper
words.
It
is
so
with
some
men.
Yes,
I
understand
the
sort
of
mind.
Vigorous,
decided,
with
sentiments
to
a
certain
point,
not
coarse.
A
better
written
letter,
Harriet
(returning
it,)
than
I
had
expected."
"Well,"
said
the
still
waiting
Harriet;
"well
and
and
what
shall
I
do?"
"What
shall
you
do!
In
what
respect?
Do
you
mean
with
regard
to
this
letter?"
"Yes."
"But
what
are
you
in
doubt
of?
You
must
answer
it
of
course
and
speedily."
"Yes.
But
what
shall
I
say?
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
do
advise
me."
"Oh
no,
no!
the
letter
had
much
better
be
all
your
own.
You
will
express
yourself
very
properly,
I
am
sure.
There
is
no
danger
of
your
not
being
intelligible,
which
is
the
first
thing.
Your
meaning
must
be
unequivocal;
no
doubts
or
demurs:
and
such
expressions
of
gratitude
and
concern
for
the
pain
you
are
inflicting
as
propriety
requires,
will
present
themselves
unbidden
to
your
mind,
I
am
persuaded.
You
need
not
be
prompted
to
write
with
the
appearance
of
sorrow
for
his
disappointment."
"You
think
I
ought
to
refuse
him
then,"
said
Harriet,
looking
down.
"Ought
to
refuse
him!
My
dear
Harriet,
what
do
you
mean?
Are
you
in
any
doubt
as
to
that?
I
thought
but
I
beg
your
pardon,
perhaps
I
have
been
under
a
mistake.
I
certainly
have
been
misunderstanding
you,
if
you
feel
