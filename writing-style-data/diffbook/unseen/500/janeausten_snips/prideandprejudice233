of
my
vanity?
I
believed
you
to
be
wishing,
expecting
my
addresses."
"My
manners
must
have
been
in
fault,
but
not
intentionally,
I
assure
you.
I
never
meant
to
deceive
you,
but
my
spirits
might
often
lead
me
wrong.
How
you
must
have
hated
me
after
that
evening?"
"Hate
you!
I
was
angry
perhaps
at
first,
but
my
anger
soon
began
to
take
a
proper
direction."
"I
am
almost
afraid
of
asking
what
you
thought
of
me,
when
we
met
at
Pemberley.
You
blamed
me
for
coming?"
"No
indeed;
I
felt
nothing
but
surprise."
"Your
surprise
could
not
be
greater
than
mine
in
being
noticed
by
you.
My
conscience
told
me
that
I
deserved
no
extraordinary
politeness,
and
I
confess
that
I
did
not
expect
to
receive
more
than
my
due."
"My
object
then,"
replied
Darcy,
"was
to
show
you,
by
every
civility
in
my
power,
that
I
was
not
so
mean
as
to
resent
the
past;
and
I
hoped
to
obtain
your
forgiveness,
to
lessen
your
ill
opinion,
by
letting
you
see
that
your
reproofs
had
been
attended
to.
How
soon
any
other
wishes
introduced
themselves
I
can
hardly
tell,
but
I
believe
in
about
half
an
hour
after
I
had
seen
you."
He
then
told
her
of
Georgiana's
delight
in
her
acquaintance,
and
of
her
disappointment
at
its
sudden
interruption;
which
naturally
leading
to
the
cause
of
that
interruption,
she
soon
learnt
that
his
resolution
of
following
her
from
Derbyshire
in
quest
of
her
sister
had
been
formed
before
he
quitted
the
inn,
and
that
his
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
there
had
arisen
from
no
other
struggles
than
what
such
a
purpose
must
comprehend.
She
expressed
her
gratitude
again,
but
it
was
too
painful
a
subject
to
each,
to
be
dwelt
on
farther.
After
walking
several
miles
in
a
leisurely
manner,
and
too
busy
to
know
anything
about
it,
they
found
at
last,
on
examining
their
watches,
that
it
was
time
to
be
at
home.
"What
could
become
of
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane!"
was
a
wonder
which
introduced
the
discussion
of
their
affairs.
Darcy
was
delighted
with
their
engagement;
his
friend
had
given
him
the
earliest
information
of
it.
"I
must
ask
whether
you
were
surprised?"
said
Elizabeth.
"Not
at
all.
When
I
went
away,
I
felt
that
it
would
soon
happen."
"That
is
to
say,
you
had
given
your
permission.
I
guessed
as
much."
And
though
he
exclaimed
at
the
term,
she
found
that
it
had
been
pretty
much
the
case.
"On
the
evening
before
my
going
to
London,"
said
he,
"I
made
a
confession
to
him,
which
I
believe
I
ought
to
have
made
long
ago.
I
told
him
of
all
that
had
occurred
to
make
my
former
interference
in
his
affairs
absurd
and
impertinent.
His
surprise
was
great.
He
had
never
had
the
slightest
suspicion.
I
told
him,
moreover,
that
I
believed
myself
mistaken
in
supposing,
as
I
had
done,
that
your
sister
was
indifferent
to
him;
and
as
I
could
easily
perceive
that
his
attachment
