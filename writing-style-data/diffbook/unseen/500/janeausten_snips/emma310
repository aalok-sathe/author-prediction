to
break
it
to
her
father
at
last!
She
had
bound
herself
to
do
it,
in
such
an
hour
of
Mr.
Knightley's
absence,
or
when
it
came
to
the
point
her
heart
would
have
failed
her,
and
she
must
have
put
it
off;
but
Mr.
Knightley
was
to
come
at
such
a
time,
and
follow
up
the
beginning
she
was
to
make.
She
was
forced
to
speak,
and
to
speak
cheerfully
too.
She
must
not
make
it
a
more
decided
subject
of
misery
to
him,
by
a
melancholy
tone
herself.
She
must
not
appear
to
think
it
a
misfortune.
With
all
the
spirits
she
could
command,
she
prepared
him
first
for
something
strange,
and
then,
in
a
few
words,
said,
that
if
his
consent
and
approbation
could
be
obtained
which,
she
trusted,
would
be
attended
with
no
difficulty,
since
it
was
a
plan
to
promote
the
happiness
of
all
she
and
Mr.
Knightley
meant
to
marry;
by
which
means
Hartfield
would
receive
the
constant
addition
of
that
person's
company
whom
she
knew
he
loved,
next
to
his
daughters
and
Mrs.
Weston,
best
in
the
world.
Poor
man!
it
was
at
first
a
considerable
shock
to
him,
and
he
tried
earnestly
to
dissuade
her
from
it.
She
was
reminded,
more
than
once,
of
having
always
said
she
would
never
marry,
and
assured
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
her
to
remain
single;
and
told
of
poor
Isabella,
and
poor
Miss
Taylor.
But
it
would
not
do.
Emma
hung
about
him
affectionately,
and
smiled,
and
said
it
must
be
so;
and
that
he
must
not
class
her
with
Isabella
and
Mrs.
Weston,
whose
marriages
taking
them
from
Hartfield,
had,
indeed,
made
a
melancholy
change:
but
she
was
not
going
from
Hartfield;
she
should
be
always
there;
she
was
introducing
no
change
in
their
numbers
or
their
comforts
but
for
the
better;
and
she
was
very
sure
that
he
would
be
a
great
deal
the
happier
for
having
Mr.
Knightley
always
at
hand,
when
he
were
once
got
used
to
the
idea.
Did
he
not
love
Mr.
Knightley
very
much?
He
would
not
deny
that
he
did,
she
was
sure.
Whom
did
he
ever
want
to
consult
on
business
but
Mr.
Knightley?
Who
was
so
useful
to
him,
who
so
ready
to
write
his
letters,
who
so
glad
to
assist
him?
Who
so
cheerful,
so
attentive,
so
attached
to
him?
Would
not
he
like
to
have
him
always
on
the
spot?
Yes.
That
was
all
very
true.
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
be
there
too
often;
he
should
be
glad
to
see
him
every
day;
but
they
did
see
him
every
day
as
it
was.
Why
could
not
they
go
on
as
they
had
done?
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
not
be
soon
reconciled;
but
the
worst
was
overcome,
the
idea
was
given;
time
and
continual
repetition
must
do
the
rest.
To
Emma's
entreaties
and
assurances
succeeded
Mr.
Knightley's,
whose
fond
praise
of
her
gave
the
subject
even
a
kind
of
welcome;
and
