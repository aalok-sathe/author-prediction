I
have
been
so
disappointed."
And
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner,
to
indulge
her
murmurs,
or
to
reason
them
away;
probably
a
little
of
both
such
being
the
commonest
process
of
a
not
ill
disposed
mind.
Presently
the
carriage
stopt;
she
looked
up;
it
was
stopt
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston,
who
were
standing
to
speak
to
her.
There
was
instant
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
them,
and
still
greater
pleasure
was
conveyed
in
sound
for
Mr.
Weston
immediately
accosted
her
with,
"How
d'ye
do?
how
d'ye
do?
We
have
been
sitting
with
your
father
glad
to
see
him
so
well.
Frank
comes
to
morrow
I
had
a
letter
this
morning
we
see
him
to
morrow
by
dinner
time
to
a
certainty
he
is
at
Oxford
to
day,
and
he
comes
for
a
whole
fortnight;
I
knew
it
would
be
so.
If
he
had
come
at
Christmas
he
could
not
have
staid
three
days;
I
was
always
glad
he
did
not
come
at
Christmas;
now
we
are
going
to
have
just
the
right
weather
for
him,
fine,
dry,
settled
weather.
We
shall
enjoy
him
completely;
every
thing
has
turned
out
exactly
as
we
could
wish."
There
was
no
resisting
such
news,
no
possibility
of
avoiding
the
influence
of
such
a
happy
face
as
Mr.
Weston's,
confirmed
as
it
all
was
by
the
words
and
the
countenance
of
his
wife,
fewer
and
quieter,
but
not
less
to
the
purpose.
To
know
that
she
thought
his
coming
certain
was
enough
to
make
Emma
consider
it
so,
and
sincerely
did
she
rejoice
in
their
joy.
It
was
a
most
delightful
reanimation
of
exhausted
spirits.
The
worn
out
past
was
sunk
in
the
freshness
of
what
was
coming;
and
in
the
rapidity
of
half
a
moment's
thought,
she
hoped
Mr.
Elton
would
now
be
talked
of
no
more.
Mr.
Weston
gave
her
the
history
of
the
engagements
at
Enscombe,
which
allowed
his
son
to
answer
for
having
an
entire
fortnight
at
his
command,
as
well
as
the
route
and
the
method
of
his
journey;
and
she
listened,
and
smiled,
and
congratulated.
"I
shall
soon
bring
him
over
to
Hartfield,"
said
he,
at
the
conclusion.
Emma
could
imagine
she
saw
a
touch
of
the
arm
at
this
speech,
from
his
wife.
"We
had
better
move
on,
Mr.
Weston,"
said
she,
"we
are
detaining
the
girls."
"Well,
well,
I
am
ready;"
and
turning
again
to
Emma,
"but
you
must
not
be
expecting
such
a
very
fine
young
man;
you
have
only
had
my
account
you
know;
I
dare
say
he
is
really
nothing
extraordinary:"
though
his
own
sparkling
eyes
at
the
moment
were
speaking
a
very
different
conviction.
Emma
could
look
perfectly
unconscious
and
innocent,
and
answer
in
a
manner
that
appropriated
nothing.
"Think
of
me
to
morrow,
my
dear
Emma,
about
four
o'clock,"
was
Mrs.
Weston's
parting
injunction;
spoken
with
some
anxiety,
and
meant
only
for
her.
"Four
o'clock!
depend
upon
it
he
will
be
here
by
three,"
was
Mr.
Weston's
quick
amendment;
and
