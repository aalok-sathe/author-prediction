endure.
They
came.
The
family
were
assembled
in
the
breakfast
room
to
receive
them.
Smiles
decked
the
face
of
Mrs.
Bennet
as
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door;
her
husband
looked
impenetrably
grave;
her
daughters,
alarmed,
anxious,
uneasy.
Lydia's
voice
was
heard
in
the
vestibule;
the
door
was
thrown
open,
and
she
ran
into
the
room.
Her
mother
stepped
forwards,
embraced
her,
and
welcomed
her
with
rapture;
gave
her
hand,
with
an
affectionate
smile,
to
Wickham,
who
followed
his
lady;
and
wished
them
both
joy
with
an
alacrity
which
shewed
no
doubt
of
their
happiness.
Their
reception
from
Mr.
Bennet,
to
whom
they
then
turned,
was
not
quite
so
cordial.
His
countenance
rather
gained
in
austerity;
and
he
scarcely
opened
his
lips.
The
easy
assurance
of
the
young
couple,
indeed,
was
enough
to
provoke
him.
Elizabeth
was
disgusted,
and
even
Miss
Bennet
was
shocked.
Lydia
was
Lydia
still;
untamed,
unabashed,
wild,
noisy,
and
fearless.
She
turned
from
sister
to
sister,
demanding
their
congratulations;
and
when
at
length
they
all
sat
down,
looked
eagerly
round
the
room,
took
notice
of
some
little
alteration
in
it,
and
observed,
with
a
laugh,
that
it
was
a
great
while
since
she
had
been
there.
Wickham
was
not
at
all
more
distressed
than
herself,
but
his
manners
were
always
so
pleasing,
that
had
his
character
and
his
marriage
been
exactly
what
they
ought,
his
smiles
and
his
easy
address,
while
he
claimed
their
relationship,
would
have
delighted
them
all.
Elizabeth
had
not
before
believed
him
quite
equal
to
such
assurance;
but
she
sat
down,
resolving
within
herself
to
draw
no
limits
in
future
to
the
impudence
of
an
impudent
man.
She
blushed,
and
Jane
blushed;
but
the
cheeks
of
the
two
who
caused
their
confusion
suffered
no
variation
of
colour.
There
was
no
want
of
discourse.
The
bride
and
her
mother
could
neither
of
them
talk
fast
enough;
and
Wickham,
who
happened
to
sit
near
Elizabeth,
began
inquiring
after
his
acquaintance
in
that
neighbourhood,
with
a
good
humoured
ease
which
she
felt
very
unable
to
equal
in
her
replies.
They
seemed
each
of
them
to
have
the
happiest
memories
in
the
world.
Nothing
of
the
past
was
recollected
with
pain;
and
Lydia
led
voluntarily
to
subjects
which
her
sisters
would
not
have
alluded
to
for
the
world.
"Only
think
of
its
being
three
months,"
she
cried,
"since
I
went
away;
it
seems
but
a
fortnight
I
declare;
and
yet
there
have
been
things
enough
happened
in
the
time.
Good
gracious!
when
I
went
away,
I
am
sure
I
had
no
more
idea
of
being
married
till
I
came
back
again!
though
I
thought
it
would
be
very
good
fun
if
I
was."
Her
father
lifted
up
his
eyes.
Jane
was
distressed.
Elizabeth
looked
expressively
at
Lydia;
but
she,
who
never
heard
nor
saw
anything
of
which
she
chose
to
be
insensible,
gaily
continued,
"Oh!
mamma,
do
the
people
hereabouts
know
I
am
married
to
day?
I
was
afraid
they
might
not;
and
we
overtook
