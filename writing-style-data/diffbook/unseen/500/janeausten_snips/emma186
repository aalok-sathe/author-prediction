natural
and
reasonable
admiration
but
without
solicitation,
or
plea,
or
privilege,
she
must
be
wanting
to
assist
and
befriend
her.
Before
Emma
had
forfeited
her
confidence,
and
about
the
third
time
of
their
meeting,
she
heard
all
Mrs.
Elton's
knight
errantry
on
the
subject.
"Jane
Fairfax
is
absolutely
charming,
Miss
Woodhouse.
I
quite
rave
about
Jane
Fairfax.
A
sweet,
interesting
creature.
So
mild
and
ladylike
and
with
such
talents!
I
assure
you
I
think
she
has
very
extraordinary
talents.
I
do
not
scruple
to
say
that
she
plays
extremely
well.
I
know
enough
of
music
to
speak
decidedly
on
that
point.
Oh!
she
is
absolutely
charming!
You
will
laugh
at
my
warmth
but,
upon
my
word,
I
talk
of
nothing
but
Jane
Fairfax.
And
her
situation
is
so
calculated
to
affect
one!
Miss
Woodhouse,
we
must
exert
ourselves
and
endeavour
to
do
something
for
her.
We
must
bring
her
forward.
Such
talent
as
hers
must
not
be
suffered
to
remain
unknown.
I
dare
say
you
have
heard
those
charming
lines
of
the
poet,
'Full
many
a
flower
is
born
to
blush
unseen,
'And
waste
its
fragrance
on
the
desert
air.'
We
must
not
allow
them
to
be
verified
in
sweet
Jane
Fairfax."
"I
cannot
think
there
is
any
danger
of
it,"
was
Emma's
calm
answer
"and
when
you
are
better
acquainted
with
Miss
Fairfax's
situation
and
understand
what
her
home
has
been,
with
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell,
I
have
no
idea
that
you
will
suppose
her
talents
can
be
unknown."
"Oh!
but
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
she
is
now
in
such
retirement,
such
obscurity,
so
thrown
away.
Whatever
advantages
she
may
have
enjoyed
with
the
Campbells
are
so
palpably
at
an
end!
And
I
think
she
feels
it.
I
am
sure
she
does.
She
is
very
timid
and
silent.
One
can
see
that
she
feels
the
want
of
encouragement.
I
like
her
the
better
for
it.
I
must
confess
it
is
a
recommendation
to
me.
I
am
a
great
advocate
for
timidity
and
I
am
sure
one
does
not
often
meet
with
it.
But
in
those
who
are
at
all
inferior,
it
is
extremely
prepossessing.
Oh!
I
assure
you,
Jane
Fairfax
is
a
very
delightful
character,
and
interests
me
more
than
I
can
express."
"You
appear
to
feel
a
great
deal
but
I
am
not
aware
how
you
or
any
of
Miss
Fairfax's
acquaintance
here,
any
of
those
who
have
known
her
longer
than
yourself,
can
shew
her
any
other
attention
than"
"My
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
a
vast
deal
may
be
done
by
those
who
dare
to
act.
You
and
I
need
not
be
afraid.
If
we
set
the
example,
many
will
follow
it
as
far
as
they
can;
though
all
have
not
our
situations.
We
have
carriages
to
fetch
and
convey
her
home,
and
we
live
in
a
style
which
could
not
make
the
addition
of
Jane
Fairfax,
at
any
time,
the
least
inconvenient.
I
should
be
extremely
displeased
if
Wright
were
to
send
us
up
such
a
dinner,
as
