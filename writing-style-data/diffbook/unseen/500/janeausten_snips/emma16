one
of
them
quite
as
large
as
Mrs.
Goddard's
drawing
room;
and
of
her
having
an
upper
maid
who
had
lived
five
and
twenty
years
with
her;
and
of
their
having
eight
cows,
two
of
them
Alderneys,
and
one
a
little
Welch
cow,
a
very
pretty
little
Welch
cow
indeed;
and
of
Mrs.
Martin's
saying
as
she
was
so
fond
of
it,
it
should
be
called
her
cow;
and
of
their
having
a
very
handsome
summer
house
in
their
garden,
where
some
day
next
year
they
were
all
to
drink
tea:
a
very
handsome
summer
house,
large
enough
to
hold
a
dozen
people."
For
some
time
she
was
amused,
without
thinking
beyond
the
immediate
cause;
but
as
she
came
to
understand
the
family
better,
other
feelings
arose.
She
had
taken
up
a
wrong
idea,
fancying
it
was
a
mother
and
daughter,
a
son
and
son's
wife,
who
all
lived
together;
but
when
it
appeared
that
the
Mr.
Martin,
who
bore
a
part
in
the
narrative,
and
was
always
mentioned
with
approbation
for
his
great
good
nature
in
doing
something
or
other,
was
a
single
man;
that
there
was
no
young
Mrs.
Martin,
no
wife
in
the
case;
she
did
suspect
danger
to
her
poor
little
friend
from
all
this
hospitality
and
kindness,
and
that,
if
she
were
not
taken
care
of,
she
might
be
required
to
sink
herself
forever.
With
this
inspiriting
notion,
her
questions
increased
in
number
and
meaning;
and
she
particularly
led
Harriet
to
talk
more
of
Mr.
Martin,
and
there
was
evidently
no
dislike
to
it.
Harriet
was
very
ready
to
speak
of
the
share
he
had
had
in
their
moonlight
walks
and
merry
evening
games;
and
dwelt
a
good
deal
upon
his
being
so
very
good
humoured
and
obliging.
He
had
gone
three
miles
round
one
day
in
order
to
bring
her
some
walnuts,
because
she
had
said
how
fond
she
was
of
them,
and
in
every
thing
else
he
was
so
very
obliging.
He
had
his
shepherd's
son
into
the
parlour
one
night
on
purpose
to
sing
to
her.
She
was
very
fond
of
singing.
He
could
sing
a
little
himself.
She
believed
he
was
very
clever,
and
understood
every
thing.
He
had
a
very
fine
flock,
and,
while
she
was
with
them,
he
had
been
bid
more
for
his
wool
than
any
body
in
the
country.
She
believed
every
body
spoke
well
of
him.
His
mother
and
sisters
were
very
fond
of
him.
Mrs.
Martin
had
told
her
one
day
(and
there
was
a
blush
as
she
said
it,)
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
body
to
be
a
better
son,
and
therefore
she
was
sure,
whenever
he
married,
he
would
make
a
good
husband.
Not
that
she
wanted
him
to
marry.
She
was
in
no
hurry
at
all.
"Well
done,
Mrs.
Martin!"
thought
Emma.
"You
know
what
you
are
about."
"And
when
she
had
come
away,
Mrs.
Martin
was
so
very
kind
as
to
send
Mrs.
Goddard
a
beautiful
goose
the
finest
goose
