explanation."
Mr.
Darcy,
who
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face,
seemed
to
catch
her
words
with
no
less
resentment
than
surprise.
His
complexion
became
pale
with
anger,
and
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
was
visible
in
every
feature.
He
was
struggling
for
the
appearance
of
composure,
and
would
not
open
his
lips
till
he
believed
himself
to
have
attained
it.
The
pause
was
to
Elizabeth's
feelings
dreadful.
At
length,
with
a
voice
of
forced
calmness,
he
said:
"And
this
is
all
the
reply
which
I
am
to
have
the
honour
of
expecting!
I
might,
perhaps,
wish
to
be
informed
why,
with
so
little
endeavour
at
civility,
I
am
thus
rejected.
But
it
is
of
small
importance."
"I
might
as
well
inquire,"
replied
she,
"why
with
so
evident
a
desire
of
offending
and
insulting
me,
you
chose
to
tell
me
that
you
liked
me
against
your
will,
against
your
reason,
and
even
against
your
character?
Was
not
this
some
excuse
for
incivility,
if
I
was
uncivil?
But
I
have
other
provocations.
You
know
I
have.
Had
not
my
feelings
decided
against
you
had
they
been
indifferent,
or
had
they
even
been
favourable,
do
you
think
that
any
consideration
would
tempt
me
to
accept
the
man
who
has
been
the
means
of
ruining,
perhaps
for
ever,
the
happiness
of
a
most
beloved
sister?"
As
she
pronounced
these
words,
Mr.
Darcy
changed
colour;
but
the
emotion
was
short,
and
he
listened
without
attempting
to
interrupt
her
while
she
continued:
"I
have
every
reason
in
the
world
to
think
ill
of
you.
No
motive
can
excuse
the
unjust
and
ungenerous
part
you
acted
there.
You
dare
not,
you
cannot
deny,
that
you
have
been
the
principal,
if
not
the
only
means
of
dividing
them
from
each
other
of
exposing
one
to
the
censure
of
the
world
for
caprice
and
instability,
and
the
other
to
its
derision
for
disappointed
hopes,
and
involving
them
both
in
misery
of
the
acutest
kind."
She
paused,
and
saw
with
no
slight
indignation
that
he
was
listening
with
an
air
which
proved
him
wholly
unmoved
by
any
feeling
of
remorse.
He
even
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
of
affected
incredulity.
"Can
you
deny
that
you
have
done
it?"
she
repeated.
With
assumed
tranquillity
he
then
replied:
"I
have
no
wish
of
denying
that
I
did
everything
in
my
power
to
separate
my
friend
from
your
sister,
or
that
I
rejoice
in
my
success.
Towards
him
I
have
been
kinder
than
towards
myself."
Elizabeth
disdained
the
appearance
of
noticing
this
civil
reflection,
but
its
meaning
did
not
escape,
nor
was
it
likely
to
conciliate
her.
"But
it
is
not
merely
this
affair,"
she
continued,
"on
which
my
dislike
is
founded.
Long
before
it
had
taken
place
my
opinion
of
you
was
decided.
Your
character
was
unfolded
in
the
recital
which
I
received
many
months
ago
from
Mr.
Wickham.
On
this
subject,
what
can
you
have
to
say?
In
what
imaginary
act
of
friendship
can
