those
which
regulate
the
clergy;
for,
give
me
leave
to
observe
that
I
consider
the
clerical
office
as
equal
in
point
of
dignity
with
the
highest
rank
in
the
kingdom
provided
that
a
proper
humility
of
behaviour
is
at
the
same
time
maintained.
You
must
therefore
allow
me
to
follow
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
on
this
occasion,
which
leads
me
to
perform
what
I
look
on
as
a
point
of
duty.
Pardon
me
for
neglecting
to
profit
by
your
advice,
which
on
every
other
subject
shall
be
my
constant
guide,
though
in
the
case
before
us
I
consider
myself
more
fitted
by
education
and
habitual
study
to
decide
on
what
is
right
than
a
young
lady
like
yourself."
And
with
a
low
bow
he
left
her
to
attack
Mr.
Darcy,
whose
reception
of
his
advances
she
eagerly
watched,
and
whose
astonishment
at
being
so
addressed
was
very
evident.
Her
cousin
prefaced
his
speech
with
a
solemn
bow
and
though
she
could
not
hear
a
word
of
it,
she
felt
as
if
hearing
it
all,
and
saw
in
the
motion
of
his
lips
the
words
"apology,"
"Hunsford,"
and
"Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh."
It
vexed
her
to
see
him
expose
himself
to
such
a
man.
Mr.
Darcy
was
eyeing
him
with
unrestrained
wonder,
and
when
at
last
Mr.
Collins
allowed
him
time
to
speak,
replied
with
an
air
of
distant
civility.
Mr.
Collins,
however,
was
not
discouraged
from
speaking
again,
and
Mr.
Darcy's
contempt
seemed
abundantly
increasing
with
the
length
of
his
second
speech,
and
at
the
end
of
it
he
only
made
him
a
slight
bow,
and
moved
another
way.
Mr.
Collins
then
returned
to
Elizabeth.
"I
have
no
reason,
I
assure
you,"
said
he,
"to
be
dissatisfied
with
my
reception.
Mr.
Darcy
seemed
much
pleased
with
the
attention.
He
answered
me
with
the
utmost
civility,
and
even
paid
me
the
compliment
of
saying
that
he
was
so
well
convinced
of
Lady
Catherine's
discernment
as
to
be
certain
she
could
never
bestow
a
favour
unworthily.
It
was
really
a
very
handsome
thought.
Upon
the
whole,
I
am
much
pleased
with
him."
As
Elizabeth
had
no
longer
any
interest
of
her
own
to
pursue,
she
turned
her
attention
almost
entirely
on
her
sister
and
Mr.
Bingley;
and
the
train
of
agreeable
reflections
which
her
observations
gave
birth
to,
made
her
perhaps
almost
as
happy
as
Jane.
She
saw
her
in
idea
settled
in
that
very
house,
in
all
the
felicity
which
a
marriage
of
true
affection
could
bestow;
and
she
felt
capable,
under
such
circumstances,
of
endeavouring
even
to
like
Bingley's
two
sisters.
Her
mother's
thoughts
she
plainly
saw
were
bent
the
same
way,
and
she
determined
not
to
venture
near
her,
lest
she
might
hear
too
much.
When
they
sat
down
to
supper,
therefore,
she
considered
it
a
most
unlucky
perverseness
which
placed
them
within
one
of
each
other;
and
deeply
was
she
vexed
to
find
that
her
mother
was
talking
to
that
one
person
(Lady
Lucas)
freely,
openly,
and
