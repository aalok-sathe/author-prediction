not
sport
with
your
impatience,
by
reading
what
he
says
on
that
point.
What
relates
to
yourself,
is
as
follows:
'Having
thus
offered
you
the
sincere
congratulations
of
Mrs.
Collins
and
myself
on
this
happy
event,
let
me
now
add
a
short
hint
on
the
subject
of
another;
of
which
we
have
been
advertised
by
the
same
authority.
Your
daughter
Elizabeth,
it
is
presumed,
will
not
long
bear
the
name
of
Bennet,
after
her
elder
sister
has
resigned
it,
and
the
chosen
partner
of
her
fate
may
be
reasonably
looked
up
to
as
one
of
the
most
illustrious
personages
in
this
land.'
"Can
you
possibly
guess,
Lizzy,
who
is
meant
by
this?
'This
young
gentleman
is
blessed,
in
a
peculiar
way,
with
every
thing
the
heart
of
mortal
can
most
desire,
splendid
property,
noble
kindred,
and
extensive
patronage.
Yet
in
spite
of
all
these
temptations,
let
me
warn
my
cousin
Elizabeth,
and
yourself,
of
what
evils
you
may
incur
by
a
precipitate
closure
with
this
gentleman's
proposals,
which,
of
course,
you
will
be
inclined
to
take
immediate
advantage
of.'
"Have
you
any
idea,
Lizzy,
who
this
gentleman
is?
But
now
it
comes
out:
"'My
motive
for
cautioning
you
is
as
follows.
We
have
reason
to
imagine
that
his
aunt,
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh,
does
not
look
on
the
match
with
a
friendly
eye.'
"Mr.
Darcy,
you
see,
is
the
man!
Now,
Lizzy,
I
think
I
have
surprised
you.
Could
he,
or
the
Lucases,
have
pitched
on
any
man
within
the
circle
of
our
acquaintance,
whose
name
would
have
given
the
lie
more
effectually
to
what
they
related?
Mr.
Darcy,
who
never
looks
at
any
woman
but
to
see
a
blemish,
and
who
probably
never
looked
at
you
in
his
life!
It
is
admirable!"
Elizabeth
tried
to
join
in
her
father's
pleasantry,
but
could
only
force
one
most
reluctant
smile.
Never
had
his
wit
been
directed
in
a
manner
so
little
agreeable
to
her.
"Are
you
not
diverted?"
"Oh!
yes.
Pray
read
on."
"'After
mentioning
the
likelihood
of
this
marriage
to
her
ladyship
last
night,
she
immediately,
with
her
usual
condescension,
expressed
what
she
felt
on
the
occasion;
when
it
became
apparent,
that
on
the
score
of
some
family
objections
on
the
part
of
my
cousin,
she
would
never
give
her
consent
to
what
she
termed
so
disgraceful
a
match.
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
give
the
speediest
intelligence
of
this
to
my
cousin,
that
she
and
her
noble
admirer
may
be
aware
of
what
they
are
about,
and
not
run
hastily
into
a
marriage
which
has
not
been
properly
sanctioned.'
Mr.
Collins
moreover
adds,
'I
am
truly
rejoiced
that
my
cousin
Lydia's
sad
business
has
been
so
well
hushed
up,
and
am
only
concerned
that
their
living
together
before
the
marriage
took
place
should
be
so
generally
known.
I
must
not,
however,
neglect
the
duties
of
my
station,
or
refrain
from
declaring
my
amazement
at
hearing
that
you
received
the
young
couple
into
your
house
as
soon
as
they
