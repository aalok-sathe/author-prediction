will
be
the
object
of
all
my
thoughts
and
cares!
and
if
my
uncle
and
aunt
go
to
town
this
spring
but
I
am
afraid
they
did
not
stir
last
spring
I
am
afraid
it
is
a
custom
gone
for
ever."
"Our
poor
ball
must
be
quite
given
up."
"Ah!
that
ball!
why
did
we
wait
for
any
thing?
why
not
seize
the
pleasure
at
once?
How
often
is
happiness
destroyed
by
preparation,
foolish
preparation!
You
told
us
it
would
be
so.
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
why
are
you
always
so
right?"
"Indeed,
I
am
very
sorry
to
be
right
in
this
instance.
I
would
much
rather
have
been
merry
than
wise."
"If
I
can
come
again,
we
are
still
to
have
our
ball.
My
father
depends
on
it.
Do
not
forget
your
engagement."
Emma
looked
graciously.
"Such
a
fortnight
as
it
has
been!"
he
continued;
"every
day
more
precious
and
more
delightful
than
the
day
before!
every
day
making
me
less
fit
to
bear
any
other
place.
Happy
those,
who
can
remain
at
Highbury!"
"As
you
do
us
such
ample
justice
now,"
said
Emma,
laughing,
"I
will
venture
to
ask,
whether
you
did
not
come
a
little
doubtfully
at
first?
Do
not
we
rather
surpass
your
expectations?
I
am
sure
we
do.
I
am
sure
you
did
not
much
expect
to
like
us.
You
would
not
have
been
so
long
in
coming,
if
you
had
had
a
pleasant
idea
of
Highbury."
He
laughed
rather
consciously;
and
though
denying
the
sentiment,
Emma
was
convinced
that
it
had
been
so.
"And
you
must
be
off
this
very
morning?"
"Yes;
my
father
is
to
join
me
here:
we
shall
walk
back
together,
and
I
must
be
off
immediately.
I
am
almost
afraid
that
every
moment
will
bring
him."
"Not
five
minutes
to
spare
even
for
your
friends
Miss
Fairfax
and
Miss
Bates?
How
unlucky!
Miss
Bates's
powerful,
argumentative
mind
might
have
strengthened
yours."
"Yes
I
have
called
there;
passing
the
door,
I
thought
it
better.
It
was
a
right
thing
to
do.
I
went
in
for
three
minutes,
and
was
detained
by
Miss
Bates's
being
absent.
She
was
out;
and
I
felt
it
impossible
not
to
wait
till
she
came
in.
She
is
a
woman
that
one
may,
that
one
must
laugh
at;
but
that
one
would
not
wish
to
slight.
It
was
better
to
pay
my
visit,
then"
He
hesitated,
got
up,
walked
to
a
window.
"In
short,"
said
he,
"perhaps,
Miss
Woodhouse
I
think
you
can
hardly
be
quite
without
suspicion"
He
looked
at
her,
as
if
wanting
to
read
her
thoughts.
She
hardly
knew
what
to
say.
It
seemed
like
the
forerunner
of
something
absolutely
serious,
which
she
did
not
wish.
Forcing
herself
to
speak,
therefore,
in
the
hope
of
putting
it
by,
she
calmly
said,
"You
are
quite
in
the
right;
it
was
most
natural
to
pay
your
visit,
then"
He
was
silent.
She
believed
he
was
looking
at
her;
probably
reflecting
on
what
she
had
said,
and
trying
