quarter.
It
was
by
no
means
his
daughter's
wish
that
the
intellects
of
Highbury
in
general
should
be
put
under
requisition.
Mr.
Elton
was
the
only
one
whose
assistance
she
asked.
He
was
invited
to
contribute
any
really
good
enigmas,
charades,
or
conundrums
that
he
might
recollect;
and
she
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
most
intently
at
work
with
his
recollections;
and
at
the
same
time,
as
she
could
perceive,
most
earnestly
careful
that
nothing
ungallant,
nothing
that
did
not
breathe
a
compliment
to
the
sex
should
pass
his
lips.
They
owed
to
him
their
two
or
three
politest
puzzles;
and
the
joy
and
exultation
with
which
at
last
he
recalled,
and
rather
sentimentally
recited,
that
well
known
charade,
My
first
doth
affliction
denote,
Which
my
second
is
destin'd
to
feel
And
my
whole
is
the
best
antidote
That
affliction
to
soften
and
heal.
made
her
quite
sorry
to
acknowledge
that
they
had
transcribed
it
some
pages
ago
already.
"Why
will
not
you
write
one
yourself
for
us,
Mr.
Elton?"
said
she;
"that
is
the
only
security
for
its
freshness;
and
nothing
could
be
easier
to
you."
"Oh
no!
he
had
never
written,
hardly
ever,
any
thing
of
the
kind
in
his
life.
The
stupidest
fellow!
He
was
afraid
not
even
Miss
Woodhouse"
he
stopt
a
moment
"or
Miss
Smith
could
inspire
him."
The
very
next
day
however
produced
some
proof
of
inspiration.
He
called
for
a
few
moments,
just
to
leave
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
table
containing,
as
he
said,
a
charade,
which
a
friend
of
his
had
addressed
to
a
young
lady,
the
object
of
his
admiration,
but
which,
from
his
manner,
Emma
was
immediately
convinced
must
be
his
own.
"I
do
not
offer
it
for
Miss
Smith's
collection,"
said
he.
"Being
my
friend's,
I
have
no
right
to
expose
it
in
any
degree
to
the
public
eye,
but
perhaps
you
may
not
dislike
looking
at
it."
The
speech
was
more
to
Emma
than
to
Harriet,
which
Emma
could
understand.
There
was
deep
consciousness
about
him,
and
he
found
it
easier
to
meet
her
eye
than
her
friend's.
He
was
gone
the
next
moment:
after
another
moment's
pause,
"Take
it,"
said
Emma,
smiling,
and
pushing
the
paper
towards
Harriet
"it
is
for
you.
Take
your
own."
But
Harriet
was
in
a
tremor,
and
could
not
touch
it;
and
Emma,
never
loth
to
be
first,
was
obliged
to
examine
it
herself.
To
Miss
CHARADE.
My

the
wealth
and
pomp
of
kings,
Lords
of
the
earth!
their
luxury
and
ease.
Another
view
of

my
second

Behold
him

But

what
reverse
we
have!
Man's
boasted
power

freedom,
all
are
flown;
Lord
of
the

he
bends
a
slave,
And
woman,
lovely
woman,

Thy
ready
wit
the
word
will
soon
supply,
May
its
approval
beam
in
that
soft
eye!
