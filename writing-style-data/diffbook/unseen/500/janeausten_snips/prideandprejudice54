is
enough
I
think
it
is
no
sacrifice
to
join
occasionally
in
evening
engagements.
Society
has
claims
on
us
all;
and
I
profess
myself
one
of
those
who
consider
intervals
of
recreation
and
amusement
as
desirable
for
everybody."
Elizabeth's
spirits
were
so
high
on
this
occasion,
that
though
she
did
not
often
speak
unnecessarily
to
Mr.
Collins,
she
could
not
help
asking
him
whether
he
intended
to
accept
Mr.
Bingley's
invitation,
and
if
he
did,
whether
he
would
think
it
proper
to
join
in
the
evening's
amusement;
and
she
was
rather
surprised
to
find
that
he
entertained
no
scruple
whatever
on
that
head,
and
was
very
far
from
dreading
a
rebuke
either
from
the
Archbishop,
or
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh,
by
venturing
to
dance.
"I
am
by
no
means
of
the
opinion,
I
assure
you,"
said
he,
"that
a
ball
of
this
kind,
given
by
a
young
man
of
character,
to
respectable
people,
can
have
any
evil
tendency;
and
I
am
so
far
from
objecting
to
dancing
myself,
that
I
shall
hope
to
be
honoured
with
the
hands
of
all
my
fair
cousins
in
the
course
of
the
evening;
and
I
take
this
opportunity
of
soliciting
yours,
Miss
Elizabeth,
for
the
two
first
dances
especially,
a
preference
which
I
trust
my
cousin
Jane
will
attribute
to
the
right
cause,
and
not
to
any
disrespect
for
her."
Elizabeth
felt
herself
completely
taken
in.
She
had
fully
proposed
being
engaged
by
Mr.
Wickham
for
those
very
dances;
and
to
have
Mr.
Collins
instead!
her
liveliness
had
never
been
worse
timed.
There
was
no
help
for
it,
however.
Mr.
Wickham's
happiness
and
her
own
were
perforce
delayed
a
little
longer,
and
Mr.
Collins's
proposal
accepted
with
as
good
a
grace
as
she
could.
She
was
not
the
better
pleased
with
his
gallantry
from
the
idea
it
suggested
of
something
more.
It
now
first
struck
her,
that
she
was
selected
from
among
her
sisters
as
worthy
of
being
mistress
of
Hunsford
Parsonage,
and
of
assisting
to
form
a
quadrille
table
at
Rosings,
in
the
absence
of
more
eligible
visitors.
The
idea
soon
reached
to
conviction,
as
she
observed
his
increasing
civilities
toward
herself,
and
heard
his
frequent
attempt
at
a
compliment
on
her
wit
and
vivacity;
and
though
more
astonished
than
gratified
herself
by
this
effect
of
her
charms,
it
was
not
long
before
her
mother
gave
her
to
understand
that
the
probability
of
their
marriage
was
extremely
agreeable
to
her.
Elizabeth,
however,
did
not
choose
to
take
the
hint,
being
well
aware
that
a
serious
dispute
must
be
the
consequence
of
any
reply.
Mr.
Collins
might
never
make
the
offer,
and
till
he
did,
it
was
useless
to
quarrel
about
him.
If
there
had
not
been
a
Netherfield
ball
to
prepare
for
and
talk
of,
the
younger
Miss
Bennets
would
have
been
in
a
very
pitiable
state
at
this
time,
for
from
the
day
of
the
invitation,
to
the
day
of
the
ball,
there
was
such
a
succession
of
rain
as
prevented
their
