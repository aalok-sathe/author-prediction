figure,
among
the
bulky
forms
and
stooping
shoulders
of
the
elderly
men,
was
such
as
Emma
felt
must
draw
every
body's
eyes;
and,
excepting
her
own
partner,
there
was
not
one
among
the
whole
row
of
young
men
who
could
be
compared
with
him.
He
moved
a
few
steps
nearer,
and
those
few
steps
were
enough
to
prove
in
how
gentlemanlike
a
manner,
with
what
natural
grace,
he
must
have
danced,
would
he
but
take
the
trouble.
Whenever
she
caught
his
eye,
she
forced
him
to
smile;
but
in
general
he
was
looking
grave.
She
wished
he
could
love
a
ballroom
better,
and
could
like
Frank
Churchill
better.
He
seemed
often
observing
her.
She
must
not
flatter
herself
that
he
thought
of
her
dancing,
but
if
he
were
criticising
her
behaviour,
she
did
not
feel
afraid.
There
was
nothing
like
flirtation
between
her
and
her
partner.
They
seemed
more
like
cheerful,
easy
friends,
than
lovers.
That
Frank
Churchill
thought
less
of
her
than
he
had
done,
was
indubitable.
The
ball
proceeded
pleasantly.
The
anxious
cares,
the
incessant
attentions
of
Mrs.
Weston,
were
not
thrown
away.
Every
body
seemed
happy;
and
the
praise
of
being
a
delightful
ball,
which
is
seldom
bestowed
till
after
a
ball
has
ceased
to
be,
was
repeatedly
given
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
existence
of
this.
Of
very
important,
very
recordable
events,
it
was
not
more
productive
than
such
meetings
usually
are.
There
was
one,
however,
which
Emma
thought
something
of.
The
two
last
dances
before
supper
were
begun,
and
Harriet
had
no
partner;
the
only
young
lady
sitting
down;
and
so
equal
had
been
hitherto
the
number
of
dancers,
that
how
there
could
be
any
one
disengaged
was
the
wonder!
But
Emma's
wonder
lessened
soon
afterwards,
on
seeing
Mr.
Elton
sauntering
about.
He
would
not
ask
Harriet
to
dance
if
it
were
possible
to
be
avoided:
she
was
sure
he
would
not
and
she
was
expecting
him
every
moment
to
escape
into
the
card
room.
Escape,
however,
was
not
his
plan.
He
came
to
the
part
of
the
room
where
the
sitters
by
were
collected,
spoke
to
some,
and
walked
about
in
front
of
them,
as
if
to
shew
his
liberty,
and
his
resolution
of
maintaining
it.
He
did
not
omit
being
sometimes
directly
before
Miss
Smith,
or
speaking
to
those
who
were
close
to
her.
Emma
saw
it.
She
was
not
yet
dancing;
she
was
working
her
way
up
from
the
bottom,
and
had
therefore
leisure
to
look
around,
and
by
only
turning
her
head
a
little
she
saw
it
all.
When
she
was
half
way
up
the
set,
the
whole
group
were
exactly
behind
her,
and
she
would
no
longer
allow
her
eyes
to
watch;
but
Mr.
Elton
was
so
near,
that
she
heard
every
syllable
of
a
dialogue
which
just
then
took
place
between
him
and
Mrs.
Weston;
and
she
perceived
that
his
wife,
who
was
standing
immediately
above
her,
was
not
only
listening
also,
but
even
encouraging
him
by
significant
