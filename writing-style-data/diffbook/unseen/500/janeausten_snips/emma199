would
take
up
with
any
thing;
but
I
shall
be
a
little
more
nice,
and
I
am
sure
the
good
Campbells
will
be
quite
on
my
side;
with
your
superior
talents,
you
have
a
right
to
move
in
the
first
circle.
Your
musical
knowledge
alone
would
entitle
you
to
name
your
own
terms,
have
as
many
rooms
as
you
like,
and
mix
in
the
family
as
much
as
you
chose;
that
is
I
do
not
know
if
you
knew
the
harp,
you
might
do
all
that,
I
am
very
sure;
but
you
sing
as
well
as
play;
yes,
I
really
believe
you
might,
even
without
the
harp,
stipulate
for
what
you
chose;
and
you
must
and
shall
be
delightfully,
honourably
and
comfortably
settled
before
the
Campbells
or
I
have
any
rest."
"You
may
well
class
the
delight,
the
honour,
and
the
comfort
of
such
a
situation
together,"
said
Jane,
"they
are
pretty
sure
to
be
equal;
however,
I
am
very
serious
in
not
wishing
any
thing
to
be
attempted
at
present
for
me.
I
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you,
Mrs.
Elton,
I
am
obliged
to
any
body
who
feels
for
me,
but
I
am
quite
serious
in
wishing
nothing
to
be
done
till
the
summer.
For
two
or
three
months
longer
I
shall
remain
where
I
am,
and
as
I
am."
"And
I
am
quite
serious
too,
I
assure
you,"
replied
Mrs.
Elton
gaily,
"in
resolving
to
be
always
on
the
watch,
and
employing
my
friends
to
watch
also,
that
nothing
really
unexceptionable
may
pass
us."
In
this
style
she
ran
on;
never
thoroughly
stopped
by
any
thing
till
Mr.
Woodhouse
came
into
the
room;
her
vanity
had
then
a
change
of
object,
and
Emma
heard
her
saying
in
the
same
half
whisper
to
Jane,
"Here
comes
this
dear
old
beau
of
mine,
I
protest!
Only
think
of
his
gallantry
in
coming
away
before
the
other
men!
what
a
dear
creature
he
is;
I
assure
you
I
like
him
excessively.
I
admire
all
that
quaint,
old
fashioned
politeness;
it
is
much
more
to
my
taste
than
modern
ease;
modern
ease
often
disgusts
me.
But
this
good
old
Mr.
Woodhouse,
I
wish
you
had
heard
his
gallant
speeches
to
me
at
dinner.
Oh!
I
assure
you
I
began
to
think
my
caro
sposo
would
be
absolutely
jealous.
I
fancy
I
am
rather
a
favourite;
he
took
notice
of
my
gown.
How
do
you
like
it?
Selina's
choice
handsome,
I
think,
but
I
do
not
know
whether
it
is
not
over
trimmed;
I
have
the
greatest
dislike
to
the
idea
of
being
over
trimmed
quite
a
horror
of
finery.
I
must
put
on
a
few
ornaments
now,
because
it
is
expected
of
me.
A
bride,
you
know,
must
appear
like
a
bride,
but
my
natural
taste
is
all
for
simplicity;
a
simple
style
of
dress
is
so
infinitely
preferable
to
finery.
But
I
am
quite
in
the
minority,
I
believe;
few
people
seem
to
value
simplicity
of
dress,
show
and
finery
are
