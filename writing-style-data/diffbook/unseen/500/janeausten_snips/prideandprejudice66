your
staying
and
hearing
Mr.
Collins."
Elizabeth
would
not
oppose
such
an
injunction
and
a
moment's
consideration
making
her
also
sensible
that
it
would
be
wisest
to
get
it
over
as
soon
and
as
quietly
as
possible,
she
sat
down
again
and
tried
to
conceal,
by
incessant
employment
the
feelings
which
were
divided
between
distress
and
diversion.
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Kitty
walked
off,
and
as
soon
as
they
were
gone,
Mr.
Collins
began.
"Believe
me,
my
dear
Miss
Elizabeth,
that
your
modesty,
so
far
from
doing
you
any
disservice,
rather
adds
to
your
other
perfections.
You
would
have
been
less
amiable
in
my
eyes
had
there
not
been
this
little
unwillingness;
but
allow
me
to
assure
you,
that
I
have
your
respected
mother's
permission
for
this
address.
You
can
hardly
doubt
the
purport
of
my
discourse,
however
your
natural
delicacy
may
lead
you
to
dissemble;
my
attentions
have
been
too
marked
to
be
mistaken.
Almost
as
soon
as
I
entered
the
house,
I
singled
you
out
as
the
companion
of
my
future
life.
But
before
I
am
run
away
with
by
my
feelings
on
this
subject,
perhaps
it
would
be
advisable
for
me
to
state
my
reasons
for
marrying
and,
moreover,
for
coming
into
Hertfordshire
with
the
design
of
selecting
a
wife,
as
I
certainly
did."
The
idea
of
Mr.
Collins,
with
all
his
solemn
composure,
being
run
away
with
by
his
feelings,
made
Elizabeth
so
near
laughing,
that
she
could
not
use
the
short
pause
he
allowed
in
any
attempt
to
stop
him
further,
and
he
continued:
"My
reasons
for
marrying
are,
first,
that
I
think
it
a
right
thing
for
every
clergyman
in
easy
circumstances
(like
myself)
to
set
the
example
of
matrimony
in
his
parish;
secondly,
that
I
am
convinced
that
it
will
add
very
greatly
to
my
happiness;
and
thirdly
which
perhaps
I
ought
to
have
mentioned
earlier,
that
it
is
the
particular
advice
and
recommendation
of
the
very
noble
lady
whom
I
have
the
honour
of
calling
patroness.
Twice
has
she
condescended
to
give
me
her
opinion
(unasked
too!)
on
this
subject;
and
it
was
but
the
very
Saturday
night
before
I
left
Hunsford
between
our
pools
at
quadrille,
while
Mrs.
Jenkinson
was
arranging
Miss
de
Bourgh's
footstool,
that
she
said,
'Mr.
Collins,
you
must
marry.
A
clergyman
like
you
must
marry.
Choose
properly,
choose
a
gentlewoman
for
my
sake;
and
for
your
own,
let
her
be
an
active,
useful
sort
of
person,
not
brought
up
high,
but
able
to
make
a
small
income
go
a
good
way.
This
is
my
advice.
Find
such
a
woman
as
soon
as
you
can,
bring
her
to
Hunsford,
and
I
will
visit
her.'
Allow
me,
by
the
way,
to
observe,
my
fair
cousin,
that
I
do
not
reckon
the
notice
and
kindness
of
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
as
among
the
least
of
the
advantages
in
my
power
to
offer.
You
will
find
her
manners
beyond
anything
I
can
describe;
and
your
wit
and
vivacity,
I
think,
must
be
