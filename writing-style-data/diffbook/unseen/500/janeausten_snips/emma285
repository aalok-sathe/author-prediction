independence,
relieve
him
from
that
state
of
indecision,
which
must
be
more
intolerable
than
any
alternative
to
such
a
mind
as
his.
They
had
reached
the
house.
"You
are
going
in,
I
suppose?"
said
he.
"No,"
replied
Emma
quite
confirmed
by
the
depressed
manner
in
which
he
still
spoke
"I
should
like
to
take
another
turn.
Mr.
Perry
is
not
gone."
And,
after
proceeding
a
few
steps,
she
added
"I
stopped
you
ungraciously,
just
now,
Mr.
Knightley,
and,
I
am
afraid,
gave
you
pain.
But
if
you
have
any
wish
to
speak
openly
to
me
as
a
friend,
or
to
ask
my
opinion
of
any
thing
that
you
may
have
in
contemplation
as
a
friend,
indeed,
you
may
command
me.
I
will
hear
whatever
you
like.
I
will
tell
you
exactly
what
I
think."
"As
a
friend!"
repeated
Mr.
Knightley.
"Emma,
that
I
fear
is
a
word
No,
I
have
no
wish
Stay,
yes,
why
should
I
hesitate?
I
have
gone
too
far
already
for
concealment.
Emma,
I
accept
your
offer
Extraordinary
as
it
may
seem,
I
accept
it,
and
refer
myself
to
you
as
a
friend.
Tell
me,
then,
have
I
no
chance
of
ever
succeeding?"
He
stopped
in
his
earnestness
to
look
the
question,
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
overpowered
her.
"My
dearest
Emma,"
said
he,
"for
dearest
you
will
always
be,
whatever
the
event
of
this
hour's
conversation,
my
dearest,
most
beloved
Emma
tell
me
at
once.
Say
'No,'
if
it
is
to
be
said."
She
could
really
say
nothing.
"You
are
silent,"
he
cried,
with
great
animation;
"absolutely
silent!
at
present
I
ask
no
more."
Emma
was
almost
ready
to
sink
under
the
agitation
of
this
moment.
The
dread
of
being
awakened
from
the
happiest
dream,
was
perhaps
the
most
prominent
feeling.
"I
cannot
make
speeches,
Emma:"
he
soon
resumed;
and
in
a
tone
of
such
sincere,
decided,
intelligible
tenderness
as
was
tolerably
convincing.
"If
I
loved
you
less,
I
might
be
able
to
talk
about
it
more.
But
you
know
what
I
am.
You
hear
nothing
but
truth
from
me.
I
have
blamed
you,
and
lectured
you,
and
you
have
borne
it
as
no
other
woman
in
England
would
have
borne
it.
Bear
with
the
truths
I
would
tell
you
now,
dearest
Emma,
as
well
as
you
have
borne
with
them.
The
manner,
perhaps,
may
have
as
little
to
recommend
them.
God
knows,
I
have
been
a
very
indifferent
lover.
But
you
understand
me.
Yes,
you
see,
you
understand
my
feelings
and
will
return
them
if
you
can.
At
present,
I
ask
only
to
hear,
once
to
hear
your
voice."
While
he
spoke,
Emma's
mind
was
most
busy,
and,
with
all
the
wonderful
velocity
of
thought,
had
been
able
and
yet
without
losing
a
word
to
catch
and
comprehend
the
exact
truth
of
the
whole;
to
see
that
Harriet's
hopes
had
been
entirely
groundless,
a
mistake,
a
delusion,
as
complete
a
delusion
as
any
of
her
own
that
Harriet
was
nothing;
that
she
was
