doors,
to
recommend
their
being
quick,
as
Lady
Catherine
very
much
objected
to
be
kept
waiting
for
her
dinner.
Such
formidable
accounts
of
her
ladyship,
and
her
manner
of
living,
quite
frightened
Maria
Lucas
who
had
been
little
used
to
company,
and
she
looked
forward
to
her
introduction
at
Rosings
with
as
much
apprehension
as
her
father
had
done
to
his
presentation
at
St.
James's.
As
the
weather
was
fine,
they
had
a
pleasant
walk
of
about
half
a
mile
across
the
park.
Every
park
has
its
beauty
and
its
prospects;
and
Elizabeth
saw
much
to
be
pleased
with,
though
she
could
not
be
in
such
raptures
as
Mr.
Collins
expected
the
scene
to
inspire,
and
was
but
slightly
affected
by
his
enumeration
of
the
windows
in
front
of
the
house,
and
his
relation
of
what
the
glazing
altogether
had
originally
cost
Sir
Lewis
de
Bourgh.
When
they
ascended
the
steps
to
the
hall,
Maria's
alarm
was
every
moment
increasing,
and
even
Sir
William
did
not
look
perfectly
calm.
Elizabeth's
courage
did
not
fail
her.
She
had
heard
nothing
of
Lady
Catherine
that
spoke
her
awful
from
any
extraordinary
talents
or
miraculous
virtue,
and
the
mere
stateliness
of
money
or
rank
she
thought
she
could
witness
without
trepidation.
From
the
entrance
hall,
of
which
Mr.
Collins
pointed
out,
with
a
rapturous
air,
the
fine
proportion
and
the
finished
ornaments,
they
followed
the
servants
through
an
ante
chamber,
to
the
room
where
Lady
Catherine,
her
daughter,
and
Mrs.
Jenkinson
were
sitting.
Her
ladyship,
with
great
condescension,
arose
to
receive
them;
and
as
Mrs.
Collins
had
settled
it
with
her
husband
that
the
office
of
introduction
should
be
hers,
it
was
performed
in
a
proper
manner,
without
any
of
those
apologies
and
thanks
which
he
would
have
thought
necessary.
In
spite
of
having
been
at
St.
James's,
Sir
William
was
so
completely
awed
by
the
grandeur
surrounding
him,
that
he
had
but
just
courage
enough
to
make
a
very
low
bow,
and
take
his
seat
without
saying
a
word;
and
his
daughter,
frightened
almost
out
of
her
senses,
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
chair,
not
knowing
which
way
to
look.
Elizabeth
found
herself
quite
equal
to
the
scene,
and
could
observe
the
three
ladies
before
her
composedly.
Lady
Catherine
was
a
tall,
large
woman,
with
strongly
marked
features,
which
might
once
have
been
handsome.
Her
air
was
not
conciliating,
nor
was
her
manner
of
receiving
them
such
as
to
make
her
visitors
forget
their
inferior
rank.
She
was
not
rendered
formidable
by
silence;
but
whatever
she
said
was
spoken
in
so
authoritative
a
tone,
as
marked
her
self
importance,
and
brought
Mr.
Wickham
immediately
to
Elizabeth's
mind;
and
from
the
observation
of
the
day
altogether,
she
believed
Lady
Catherine
to
be
exactly
what
he
represented.
When,
after
examining
the
mother,
in
whose
countenance
and
deportment
she
soon
found
some
resemblance
of
Mr.
Darcy,
she
turned
her
eyes
on
the
daughter,
she
could
almost
have
joined
in
Maria's
astonishment
at
her
being
