every
thing
herself;
that
what
she
had
been
saying
relative
to
Harriet
had
been
all
taken
as
the
language
of
her
own
feelings;
and
that
her
agitation,
her
doubts,
her
reluctance,
her
discouragement,
had
been
all
received
as
discouragement
from
herself.
And
not
only
was
there
time
for
these
convictions,
with
all
their
glow
of
attendant
happiness;
there
was
time
also
to
rejoice
that
Harriet's
secret
had
not
escaped
her,
and
to
resolve
that
it
need
not,
and
should
not.
It
was
all
the
service
she
could
now
render
her
poor
friend;
for
as
to
any
of
that
heroism
of
sentiment
which
might
have
prompted
her
to
entreat
him
to
transfer
his
affection
from
herself
to
Harriet,
as
infinitely
the
most
worthy
of
the
two
or
even
the
more
simple
sublimity
of
resolving
to
refuse
him
at
once
and
for
ever,
without
vouchsafing
any
motive,
because
he
could
not
marry
them
both,
Emma
had
it
not.
She
felt
for
Harriet,
with
pain
and
with
contrition;
but
no
flight
of
generosity
run
mad,
opposing
all
that
could
be
probable
or
reasonable,
entered
her
brain.
She
had
led
her
friend
astray,
and
it
would
be
a
reproach
to
her
for
ever;
but
her
judgment
was
as
strong
as
her
feelings,
and
as
strong
as
it
had
ever
been
before,
in
reprobating
any
such
alliance
for
him,
as
most
unequal
and
degrading.
Her
way
was
clear,
though
not
quite
smooth.
She
spoke
then,
on
being
so
entreated.
What
did
she
say?
Just
what
she
ought,
of
course.
A
lady
always
does.
She
said
enough
to
shew
there
need
not
be
despair
and
to
invite
him
to
say
more
himself.
He
had
despaired
at
one
period;
he
had
received
such
an
injunction
to
caution
and
silence,
as
for
the
time
crushed
every
hope;
she
had
begun
by
refusing
to
hear
him.
The
change
had
perhaps
been
somewhat
sudden;
her
proposal
of
taking
another
turn,
her
renewing
the
conversation
which
she
had
just
put
an
end
to,
might
be
a
little
extraordinary!
She
felt
its
inconsistency;
but
Mr.
Knightley
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
up
with
it,
and
seek
no
farther
explanation.
Seldom,
very
seldom,
does
complete
truth
belong
to
any
human
disclosure;
seldom
can
it
happen
that
something
is
not
a
little
disguised,
or
a
little
mistaken;
but
where,
as
in
this
case,
though
the
conduct
is
mistaken,
the
feelings
are
not,
it
may
not
be
very
material.
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
impute
to
Emma
a
more
relenting
heart
than
she
possessed,
or
a
heart
more
disposed
to
accept
of
his.
He
had,
in
fact,
been
wholly
unsuspicious
of
his
own
influence.
He
had
followed
her
into
the
shrubbery
with
no
idea
of
trying
it.
He
had
come,
in
his
anxiety
to
see
how
she
bore
Frank
Churchill's
engagement,
with
no
selfish
view,
no
view
at
all,
but
of
endeavouring,
if
she
allowed
him
an
opening,
to
soothe
or
to
counsel
her.
The
rest
had
been
the
work
of
the
moment,
the
immediate
