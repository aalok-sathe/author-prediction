teach
her
to
be
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
a
man
of
consequence
and
large
fortune,
she
may
be
a
parlour
boarder
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
all
the
rest
of
her
life
or,
at
least,
(for
Harriet
Smith
is
a
girl
who
will
marry
somebody
or
other,)
till
she
grow
desperate,
and
is
glad
to
catch
at
the
old
writing
master's
son."
"We
think
so
very
differently
on
this
point,
Mr.
Knightley,
that
there
can
be
no
use
in
canvassing
it.
We
shall
only
be
making
each
other
more
angry.
But
as
to
my
letting
her
marry
Robert
Martin,
it
is
impossible;
she
has
refused
him,
and
so
decidedly,
I
think,
as
must
prevent
any
second
application.
She
must
abide
by
the
evil
of
having
refused
him,
whatever
it
may
be;
and
as
to
the
refusal
itself,
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
I
might
not
influence
her
a
little;
but
I
assure
you
there
was
very
little
for
me
or
for
any
body
to
do.
His
appearance
is
so
much
against
him,
and
his
manner
so
bad,
that
if
she
ever
were
disposed
to
favour
him,
she
is
not
now.
I
can
imagine,
that
before
she
had
seen
any
body
superior,
she
might
tolerate
him.
He
was
the
brother
of
her
friends,
and
he
took
pains
to
please
her;
and
altogether,
having
seen
nobody
better
(that
must
have
been
his
great
assistant)
she
might
not,
while
she
was
at
Abbey
Mill,
find
him
disagreeable.
But
the
case
is
altered
now.
She
knows
now
what
gentlemen
are;
and
nothing
but
a
gentleman
in
education
and
manner
has
any
chance
with
Harriet."
"Nonsense,
errant
nonsense,
as
ever
was
talked!"
cried
Mr.
Knightley.
"Robert
Martin's
manners
have
sense,
sincerity,
and
good
humour
to
recommend
them;
and
his
mind
has
more
true
gentility
than
Harriet
Smith
could
understand."
Emma
made
no
answer,
and
tried
to
look
cheerfully
unconcerned,
but
was
really
feeling
uncomfortable
and
wanting
him
very
much
to
be
gone.
She
did
not
repent
what
she
had
done;
she
still
thought
herself
a
better
judge
of
such
a
point
of
female
right
and
refinement
than
he
could
be;
but
yet
she
had
a
sort
of
habitual
respect
for
his
judgment
in
general,
which
made
her
dislike
having
it
so
loudly
against
her;
and
to
have
him
sitting
just
opposite
to
her
in
angry
state,
was
very
disagreeable.
Some
minutes
passed
in
this
unpleasant
silence,
with
only
one
attempt
on
Emma's
side
to
talk
of
the
weather,
but
he
made
no
answer.
He
was
thinking.
The
result
of
his
thoughts
appeared
at
last
in
these
words.
"Robert
Martin
has
no
great
loss
if
he
can
but
think
so;
and
I
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
does.
Your
views
for
Harriet
are
best
known
to
yourself;
but
as
you
make
no
secret
of
your
love
of
match
making,
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
views,
and
plans,
and
projects
you
have;
and
as
a
friend
I
shall
just
hint
to
you
