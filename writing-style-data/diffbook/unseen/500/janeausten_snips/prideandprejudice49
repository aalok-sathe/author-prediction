seek
legal
redress?"
"There
was
just
such
an
informality
in
the
terms
of
the
bequest
as
to
give
me
no
hope
from
law.
A
man
of
honour
could
not
have
doubted
the
intention,
but
Mr.
Darcy
chose
to
doubt
it
or
to
treat
it
as
a
merely
conditional
recommendation,
and
to
assert
that
I
had
forfeited
all
claim
to
it
by
extravagance,
imprudence
in
short
anything
or
nothing.
Certain
it
is,
that
the
living
became
vacant
two
years
ago,
exactly
as
I
was
of
an
age
to
hold
it,
and
that
it
was
given
to
another
man;
and
no
less
certain
is
it,
that
I
cannot
accuse
myself
of
having
really
done
anything
to
deserve
to
lose
it.
I
have
a
warm,
unguarded
temper,
and
I
may
have
spoken
my
opinion
of
him,
and
to
him,
too
freely.
I
can
recall
nothing
worse.
But
the
fact
is,
that
we
are
very
different
sort
of
men,
and
that
he
hates
me."
"This
is
quite
shocking!
He
deserves
to
be
publicly
disgraced."
"Some
time
or
other
he
will
be
but
it
shall
not
be
by
me.
Till
I
can
forget
his
father,
I
can
never
defy
or
expose
him."
Elizabeth
honoured
him
for
such
feelings,
and
thought
him
handsomer
than
ever
as
he
expressed
them.
"But
what,"
said
she,
after
a
pause,
"can
have
been
his
motive?
What
can
have
induced
him
to
behave
so
cruelly?"
"A
thorough,
determined
dislike
of
me
a
dislike
which
I
cannot
but
attribute
in
some
measure
to
jealousy.
Had
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
liked
me
less,
his
son
might
have
borne
with
me
better;
but
his
father's
uncommon
attachment
to
me
irritated
him,
I
believe,
very
early
in
life.
He
had
not
a
temper
to
bear
the
sort
of
competition
in
which
we
stood
the
sort
of
preference
which
was
often
given
me."
"I
had
not
thought
Mr.
Darcy
so
bad
as
this
though
I
have
never
liked
him.
I
had
not
thought
so
very
ill
of
him.
I
had
supposed
him
to
be
despising
his
fellow
creatures
in
general,
but
did
not
suspect
him
of
descending
to
such
malicious
revenge,
such
injustice,
such
inhumanity
as
this."
After
a
few
minutes'
reflection,
however,
she
continued,
"I
do
remember
his
boasting
one
day,
at
Netherfield,
of
the
implacability
of
his
resentments,
of
his
having
an
unforgiving
temper.
His
disposition
must
be
dreadful."
"I
will
not
trust
myself
on
the
subject,"
replied
Wickham;
"I
can
hardly
be
just
to
him."
Elizabeth
was
again
deep
in
thought,
and
after
a
time
exclaimed,
"To
treat
in
such
a
manner
the
godson,
the
friend,
the
favourite
of
his
father!"
She
could
have
added,
"A
young
man,
too,
like
you,
whose
very
countenance
may
vouch
for
your
being
amiable"
but
she
contented
herself
with,
"and
one,
too,
who
had
probably
been
his
companion
from
childhood,
connected
together,
as
I
think
you
said,
in
the
closest
manner!"
"We
were
born
in
the
same
parish,
within
the
same
park;
the
greatest
part
of
our
