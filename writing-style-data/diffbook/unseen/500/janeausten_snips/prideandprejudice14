can
answer."
"But
if
he
does
it
any
more
I
shall
certainly
let
him
know
that
I
see
what
he
is
about.
He
has
a
very
satirical
eye,
and
if
I
do
not
begin
by
being
impertinent
myself,
I
shall
soon
grow
afraid
of
him."
On
his
approaching
them
soon
afterwards,
though
without
seeming
to
have
any
intention
of
speaking,
Miss
Lucas
defied
her
friend
to
mention
such
a
subject
to
him;
which
immediately
provoking
Elizabeth
to
do
it,
she
turned
to
him
and
said:
"Did
you
not
think,
Mr.
Darcy,
that
I
expressed
myself
uncommonly
well
just
now,
when
I
was
teasing
Colonel
Forster
to
give
us
a
ball
at
Meryton?"
"With
great
energy;
but
it
is
always
a
subject
which
makes
a
lady
energetic."
"You
are
severe
on
us."
"It
will
be
her
turn
soon
to
be
teased,"
said
Miss
Lucas.
"I
am
going
to
open
the
instrument,
Eliza,
and
you
know
what
follows."
"You
are
a
very
strange
creature
by
way
of
a
friend!
always
wanting
me
to
play
and
sing
before
anybody
and
everybody!
If
my
vanity
had
taken
a
musical
turn,
you
would
have
been
invaluable;
but
as
it
is,
I
would
really
rather
not
sit
down
before
those
who
must
be
in
the
habit
of
hearing
the
very
best
performers."
On
Miss
Lucas's
persevering,
however,
she
added,
"Very
well,
if
it
must
be
so,
it
must."
And
gravely
glancing
at
Mr.
Darcy,
"There
is
a
fine
old
saying,
which
everybody
here
is
of
course
familiar
with:
'Keep
your
breath
to
cool
your
porridge';
and
I
shall
keep
mine
to
swell
my
song."
Her
performance
was
pleasing,
though
by
no
means
capital.
After
a
song
or
two,
and
before
she
could
reply
to
the
entreaties
of
several
that
she
would
sing
again,
she
was
eagerly
succeeded
at
the
instrument
by
her
sister
Mary,
who
having,
in
consequence
of
being
the
only
plain
one
in
the
family,
worked
hard
for
knowledge
and
accomplishments,
was
always
impatient
for
display.
Mary
had
neither
genius
nor
taste;
and
though
vanity
had
given
her
application,
it
had
given
her
likewise
a
pedantic
air
and
conceited
manner,
which
would
have
injured
a
higher
degree
of
excellence
than
she
had
reached.
Elizabeth,
easy
and
unaffected,
had
been
listened
to
with
much
more
pleasure,
though
not
playing
half
so
well;
and
Mary,
at
the
end
of
a
long
concerto,
was
glad
to
purchase
praise
and
gratitude
by
Scotch
and
Irish
airs,
at
the
request
of
her
younger
sisters,
who,
with
some
of
the
Lucases,
and
two
or
three
officers,
joined
eagerly
in
dancing
at
one
end
of
the
room.
Mr.
Darcy
stood
near
them
in
silent
indignation
at
such
a
mode
of
passing
the
evening,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
conversation,
and
was
too
much
engrossed
by
his
thoughts
to
perceive
that
Sir
William
Lucas
was
his
neighbour,
till
Sir
William
thus
began:
"What
a
charming
amusement
for
young
people
this
is,
Mr.
Darcy!
There
is
nothing
like
dancing
after
all.
I
consider
