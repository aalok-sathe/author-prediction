show
her
ladyship
about
the
different
walks.
I
think
she
will
be
pleased
with
the
hermitage."
Elizabeth
obeyed,
and
running
into
her
own
room
for
her
parasol,
attended
her
noble
guest
downstairs.
As
they
passed
through
the
hall,
Lady
Catherine
opened
the
doors
into
the
dining
parlour
and
drawing
room,
and
pronouncing
them,
after
a
short
survey,
to
be
decent
looking
rooms,
walked
on.
Her
carriage
remained
at
the
door,
and
Elizabeth
saw
that
her
waiting
woman
was
in
it.
They
proceeded
in
silence
along
the
gravel
walk
that
led
to
the
copse;
Elizabeth
was
determined
to
make
no
effort
for
conversation
with
a
woman
who
was
now
more
than
usually
insolent
and
disagreeable.
"How
could
I
ever
think
her
like
her
nephew?"
said
she,
as
she
looked
in
her
face.
As
soon
as
they
entered
the
copse,
Lady
Catherine
began
in
the
following
manner:
"You
can
be
at
no
loss,
Miss
Bennet,
to
understand
the
reason
of
my
journey
hither.
Your
own
heart,
your
own
conscience,
must
tell
you
why
I
come."
Elizabeth
looked
with
unaffected
astonishment.
"Indeed,
you
are
mistaken,
Madam.
I
have
not
been
at
all
able
to
account
for
the
honour
of
seeing
you
here."
"Miss
Bennet,"
replied
her
ladyship,
in
an
angry
tone,
"you
ought
to
know,
that
I
am
not
to
be
trifled
with.
But
however
insincere
you
may
choose
to
be,
you
shall
not
find
me
so.
My
character
has
ever
been
celebrated
for
its
sincerity
and
frankness,
and
in
a
cause
of
such
moment
as
this,
I
shall
certainly
not
depart
from
it.
A
report
of
a
most
alarming
nature
reached
me
two
days
ago.
I
was
told
that
not
only
your
sister
was
on
the
point
of
being
most
advantageously
married,
but
that
you,
that
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet,
would,
in
all
likelihood,
be
soon
afterwards
united
to
my
nephew,
my
own
nephew,
Mr.
Darcy.
Though
I
know
it
must
be
a
scandalous
falsehood,
though
I
would
not
injure
him
so
much
as
to
suppose
the
truth
of
it
possible,
I
instantly
resolved
on
setting
off
for
this
place,
that
I
might
make
my
sentiments
known
to
you."
"If
you
believed
it
impossible
to
be
true,"
said
Elizabeth,
colouring
with
astonishment
and
disdain,
"I
wonder
you
took
the
trouble
of
coming
so
far.
What
could
your
ladyship
propose
by
it?"
"At
once
to
insist
upon
having
such
a
report
universally
contradicted."
"Your
coming
to
Longbourn,
to
see
me
and
my
family,"
said
Elizabeth
coolly,
"will
be
rather
a
confirmation
of
it;
if,
indeed,
such
a
report
is
in
existence."
"If!
Do
you
then
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
it?
Has
it
not
been
industriously
circulated
by
yourselves?
Do
you
not
know
that
such
a
report
is
spread
abroad?"
"I
never
heard
that
it
was."
"And
can
you
likewise
declare,
that
there
is
no
foundation
for
it?"
"I
do
not
pretend
to
possess
equal
frankness
with
your
ladyship.
You
may
ask
questions
which
I
shall
not
choose
to
answer."
"This
is
not
to
