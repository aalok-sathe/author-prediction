to
understand
the
manner.
She
heard
him
sigh.
It
was
natural
for
him
to
feel
that
he
had
cause
to
sigh.
He
could
not
believe
her
to
be
encouraging
him.
A
few
awkward
moments
passed,
and
he
sat
down
again;
and
in
a
more
determined
manner
said,
"It
was
something
to
feel
that
all
the
rest
of
my
time
might
be
given
to
Hartfield.
My
regard
for
Hartfield
is
most
warm"
He
stopt
again,
rose
again,
and
seemed
quite
embarrassed.
He
was
more
in
love
with
her
than
Emma
had
supposed;
and
who
can
say
how
it
might
have
ended,
if
his
father
had
not
made
his
appearance?
Mr.
Woodhouse
soon
followed;
and
the
necessity
of
exertion
made
him
composed.
A
very
few
minutes
more,
however,
completed
the
present
trial.
Mr.
Weston,
always
alert
when
business
was
to
be
done,
and
as
incapable
of
procrastinating
any
evil
that
was
inevitable,
as
of
foreseeing
any
that
was
doubtful,
said,
"It
was
time
to
go;"
and
the
young
man,
though
he
might
and
did
sigh,
could
not
but
agree,
to
take
leave.
"I
shall
hear
about
you
all,"
said
he;
"that
is
my
chief
consolation.
I
shall
hear
of
every
thing
that
is
going
on
among
you.
I
have
engaged
Mrs.
Weston
to
correspond
with
me.
She
has
been
so
kind
as
to
promise
it.
Oh!
the
blessing
of
a
female
correspondent,
when
one
is
really
interested
in
the
absent!
she
will
tell
me
every
thing.
In
her
letters
I
shall
be
at
dear
Highbury
again."
A
very
friendly
shake
of
the
hand,
a
very
earnest
"Good
bye,"
closed
the
speech,
and
the
door
had
soon
shut
out
Frank
Churchill.
Short
had
been
the
notice
short
their
meeting;
he
was
gone;
and
Emma
felt
so
sorry
to
part,
and
foresaw
so
great
a
loss
to
their
little
society
from
his
absence
as
to
begin
to
be
afraid
of
being
too
sorry,
and
feeling
it
too
much.
It
was
a
sad
change.
They
had
been
meeting
almost
every
day
since
his
arrival.
Certainly
his
being
at
Randalls
had
given
great
spirit
to
the
last
two
weeks
indescribable
spirit;
the
idea,
the
expectation
of
seeing
him
which
every
morning
had
brought,
the
assurance
of
his
attentions,
his
liveliness,
his
manners!
It
had
been
a
very
happy
fortnight,
and
forlorn
must
be
the
sinking
from
it
into
the
common
course
of
Hartfield
days.
To
complete
every
other
recommendation,
he
had
almost
told
her
that
he
loved
her.
What
strength,
or
what
constancy
of
affection
he
might
be
subject
to,
was
another
point;
but
at
present
she
could
not
doubt
his
having
a
decidedly
warm
admiration,
a
conscious
preference
of
herself;
and
this
persuasion,
joined
to
all
the
rest,
made
her
think
that
she
must
be
a
little
in
love
with
him,
in
spite
of
every
previous
determination
against
it.
"I
certainly
must,"
said
she.
"This
sensation
of
listlessness,
weariness,
stupidity,
this
disinclination
to
sit
down
and
employ
myself,
this
feeling
of
every
thing's
being
dull
