great
sensibility.
When
she
came
to
that
part
of
the
letter
in
which
her
family
were
mentioned
in
terms
of
such
mortifying,
yet
merited
reproach,
her
sense
of
shame
was
severe.
The
justice
of
the
charge
struck
her
too
forcibly
for
denial,
and
the
circumstances
to
which
he
particularly
alluded
as
having
passed
at
the
Netherfield
ball,
and
as
confirming
all
his
first
disapprobation,
could
not
have
made
a
stronger
impression
on
his
mind
than
on
hers.
The
compliment
to
herself
and
her
sister
was
not
unfelt.
It
soothed,
but
it
could
not
console
her
for
the
contempt
which
had
thus
been
self
attracted
by
the
rest
of
her
family;
and
as
she
considered
that
Jane's
disappointment
had
in
fact
been
the
work
of
her
nearest
relations,
and
reflected
how
materially
the
credit
of
both
must
be
hurt
by
such
impropriety
of
conduct,
she
felt
depressed
beyond
anything
she
had
ever
known
before.
After
wandering
along
the
lane
for
two
hours,
giving
way
to
every
variety
of
thought
re
considering
events,
determining
probabilities,
and
reconciling
herself,
as
well
as
she
could,
to
a
change
so
sudden
and
so
important,
fatigue,
and
a
recollection
of
her
long
absence,
made
her
at
length
return
home;
and
she
entered
the
house
with
the
wish
of
appearing
cheerful
as
usual,
and
the
resolution
of
repressing
such
reflections
as
must
make
her
unfit
for
conversation.
She
was
immediately
told
that
the
two
gentlemen
from
Rosings
had
each
called
during
her
absence;
Mr.
Darcy,
only
for
a
few
minutes,
to
take
leave
but
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
had
been
sitting
with
them
at
least
an
hour,
hoping
for
her
return,
and
almost
resolving
to
walk
after
her
till
she
could
be
found.
Elizabeth
could
but
just
affect
concern
in
missing
him;
she
really
rejoiced
at
it.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
was
no
longer
an
object;
she
could
think
only
of
her
letter.
The
two
gentlemen
left
Rosings
the
next
morning,
and
Mr.
Collins
having
been
in
waiting
near
the
lodges,
to
make
them
his
parting
obeisance,
was
able
to
bring
home
the
pleasing
intelligence,
of
their
appearing
in
very
good
health,
and
in
as
tolerable
spirits
as
could
be
expected,
after
the
melancholy
scene
so
lately
gone
through
at
Rosings.
To
Rosings
he
then
hastened,
to
console
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter;
and
on
his
return
brought
back,
with
great
satisfaction,
a
message
from
her
ladyship,
importing
that
she
felt
herself
so
dull
as
to
make
her
very
desirous
of
having
them
all
to
dine
with
her.
Elizabeth
could
not
see
Lady
Catherine
without
recollecting
that,
had
she
chosen
it,
she
might
by
this
time
have
been
presented
to
her
as
her
future
niece;
nor
could
she
think,
without
a
smile,
of
what
her
ladyship's
indignation
would
have
been.
"What
would
she
have
said?
how
would
she
have
behaved?"
were
questions
with
which
she
amused
herself.
Their
first
subject
was
the
diminution
of
the
Rosings
party.
"I
assure
you,
I
feel
it
exceedingly,"
said
Lady
Catherine;
"I
believe
no
