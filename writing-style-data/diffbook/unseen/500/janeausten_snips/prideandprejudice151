such
a
risk.
But
against
this
there
were
objections;
and
she
finally
resolved
that
it
could
be
the
last
resource,
if
her
private
inquiries
to
the
absence
of
the
family
were
unfavourably
answered.
Accordingly,
when
she
retired
at
night,
she
asked
the
chambermaid
whether
Pemberley
were
not
a
very
fine
place?
what
was
the
name
of
its
proprietor?
and,
with
no
little
alarm,
whether
the
family
were
down
for
the
summer?
A
most
welcome
negative
followed
the
last
question
and
her
alarms
now
being
removed,
she
was
at
leisure
to
feel
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
to
see
the
house
herself;
and
when
the
subject
was
revived
the
next
morning,
and
she
was
again
applied
to,
could
readily
answer,
and
with
a
proper
air
of
indifference,
that
she
had
not
really
any
dislike
to
the
scheme.
To
Pemberley,
therefore,
they
were
to
go.
Elizabeth,
as
they
drove
along,
watched
for
the
first
appearance
of
Pemberley
Woods
with
some
perturbation;
and
when
at
length
they
turned
in
at
the
lodge,
her
spirits
were
in
a
high
flutter.
The
park
was
very
large,
and
contained
great
variety
of
ground.
They
entered
it
in
one
of
its
lowest
points,
and
drove
for
some
time
through
a
beautiful
wood
stretching
over
a
wide
extent.
Elizabeth's
mind
was
too
full
for
conversation,
but
she
saw
and
admired
every
remarkable
spot
and
point
of
view.
They
gradually
ascended
for
half
a
mile,
and
then
found
themselves
at
the
top
of
a
considerable
eminence,
where
the
wood
ceased,
and
the
eye
was
instantly
caught
by
Pemberley
House,
situated
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
valley,
into
which
the
road
with
some
abruptness
wound.
It
was
a
large,
handsome
stone
building,
standing
well
on
rising
ground,
and
backed
by
a
ridge
of
high
woody
hills;
and
in
front,
a
stream
of
some
natural
importance
was
swelled
into
greater,
but
without
any
artificial
appearance.
Its
banks
were
neither
formal
nor
falsely
adorned.
Elizabeth
was
delighted.
She
had
never
seen
a
place
for
which
nature
had
done
more,
or
where
natural
beauty
had
been
so
little
counteracted
by
an
awkward
taste.
They
were
all
of
them
warm
in
their
admiration;
and
at
that
moment
she
felt
that
to
be
mistress
of
Pemberley
might
be
something!
They
descended
the
hill,
crossed
the
bridge,
and
drove
to
the
door;
and,
while
examining
the
nearer
aspect
of
the
house,
all
her
apprehension
of
meeting
its
owner
returned.
She
dreaded
lest
the
chambermaid
had
been
mistaken.
On
applying
to
see
the
place,
they
were
admitted
into
the
hall;
and
Elizabeth,
as
they
waited
for
the
housekeeper,
had
leisure
to
wonder
at
her
being
where
she
was.
The
housekeeper
came;
a
respectable
looking
elderly
woman,
much
less
fine,
and
more
civil,
than
she
had
any
notion
of
finding
her.
They
followed
her
into
the
dining
parlour.
It
was
a
large,
well
proportioned
room,
handsomely
fitted
up.
Elizabeth,
after
slightly
surveying
it,
went
to
a
window
to
enjoy
its
prospect.
The
hill,
crowned
with
wood,
which
