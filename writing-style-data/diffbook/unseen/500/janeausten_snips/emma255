however,'
said
she;
'give
it
houseroom
till
Colonel
Campbell
comes
back.
I
shall
talk
about
it
to
him;
he
will
settle
for
me;
he
will
help
me
out
of
all
my
difficulties.'
And
to
this
day,
I
do
believe,
she
knows
not
whether
it
was
his
present
or
his
daughter's."
Now
Emma
was
obliged
to
think
of
the
pianoforte;
and
the
remembrance
of
all
her
former
fanciful
and
unfair
conjectures
was
so
little
pleasing,
that
she
soon
allowed
herself
to
believe
her
visit
had
been
long
enough;
and,
with
a
repetition
of
every
thing
that
she
could
venture
to
say
of
the
good
wishes
which
she
really
felt,
took
leave.
Emma's
pensive
meditations,
as
she
walked
home,
were
not
interrupted;
but
on
entering
the
parlour,
she
found
those
who
must
rouse
her.
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
had
arrived
during
her
absence,
and
were
sitting
with
her
father.
Mr.
Knightley
immediately
got
up,
and
in
a
manner
decidedly
graver
than
usual,
said,
"I
would
not
go
away
without
seeing
you,
but
I
have
no
time
to
spare,
and
therefore
must
now
be
gone
directly.
I
am
going
to
London,
to
spend
a
few
days
with
John
and
Isabella.
Have
you
any
thing
to
send
or
say,
besides
the
'love,'
which
nobody
carries?"
"Nothing
at
all.
But
is
not
this
a
sudden
scheme?"
"Yes
rather
I
have
been
thinking
of
it
some
little
time."
Emma
was
sure
he
had
not
forgiven
her;
he
looked
unlike
himself.
Time,
however,
she
thought,
would
tell
him
that
they
ought
to
be
friends
again.
While
he
stood,
as
if
meaning
to
go,
but
not
going
her
father
began
his
inquiries.
"Well,
my
dear,
and
did
you
get
there
safely?
And
how
did
you
find
my
worthy
old
friend
and
her
daughter?
I
dare
say
they
must
have
been
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming.
Dear
Emma
has
been
to
call
on
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates,
Mr.
Knightley,
as
I
told
you
before.
She
is
always
so
attentive
to
them!"
Emma's
colour
was
heightened
by
this
unjust
praise;
and
with
a
smile,
and
shake
of
the
head,
which
spoke
much,
she
looked
at
Mr.
Knightley.
It
seemed
as
if
there
were
an
instantaneous
impression
in
her
favour,
as
if
his
eyes
received
the
truth
from
hers,
and
all
that
had
passed
of
good
in
her
feelings
were
at
once
caught
and
honoured.
He
looked
at
her
with
a
glow
of
regard.
She
was
warmly
gratified
and
in
another
moment
still
more
so,
by
a
little
movement
of
more
than
common
friendliness
on
his
part.
He
took
her
hand;
whether
she
had
not
herself
made
the
first
motion,
she
could
not
say
she
might,
perhaps,
have
rather
offered
it
but
he
took
her
hand,
pressed
it,
and
certainly
was
on
the
point
of
carrying
it
to
his
lips
when,
from
some
fancy
or
other,
he
suddenly
let
it
go.
Why
he
should
feel
such
a
scruple,
why
he
should
change
his
mind
when
it
was
all
but
