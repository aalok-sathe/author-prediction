done,
neither
with
the
interest,
nor
(she
must
be
allowed
to
tell
herself,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Knightley's
pretensions)
with
the
skill
of
such
an
observer
on
such
a
question
as
herself,
that
he
had
spoken
it
hastily
and
in
anger,
she
was
able
to
believe,
that
he
had
rather
said
what
he
wished
resentfully
to
be
true,
than
what
he
knew
any
thing
about.
He
certainly
might
have
heard
Mr.
Elton
speak
with
more
unreserve
than
she
had
ever
done,
and
Mr.
Elton
might
not
be
of
an
imprudent,
inconsiderate
disposition
as
to
money
matters;
he
might
naturally
be
rather
attentive
than
otherwise
to
them;
but
then,
Mr.
Knightley
did
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
influence
of
a
strong
passion
at
war
with
all
interested
motives.
Mr.
Knightley
saw
no
such
passion,
and
of
course
thought
nothing
of
its
effects;
but
she
saw
too
much
of
it
to
feel
a
doubt
of
its
overcoming
any
hesitations
that
a
reasonable
prudence
might
originally
suggest;
and
more
than
a
reasonable,
becoming
degree
of
prudence,
she
was
very
sure
did
not
belong
to
Mr.
Elton.
Harriet's
cheerful
look
and
manner
established
hers:
she
came
back,
not
to
think
of
Mr.
Martin,
but
to
talk
of
Mr.
Elton.
Miss
Nash
had
been
telling
her
something,
which
she
repeated
immediately
with
great
delight.
Mr.
Perry
had
been
to
Mrs.
Goddard's
to
attend
a
sick
child,
and
Miss
Nash
had
seen
him,
and
he
had
told
Miss
Nash,
that
as
he
was
coming
back
yesterday
from
Clayton
Park,
he
had
met
Mr.
Elton,
and
found
to
his
great
surprize,
that
Mr.
Elton
was
actually
on
his
road
to
London,
and
not
meaning
to
return
till
the
morrow,
though
it
was
the
whist
club
night,
which
he
had
been
never
known
to
miss
before;
and
Mr.
Perry
had
remonstrated
with
him
about
it,
and
told
him
how
shabby
it
was
in
him,
their
best
player,
to
absent
himself,
and
tried
very
much
to
persuade
him
to
put
off
his
journey
only
one
day;
but
it
would
not
do;
Mr.
Elton
had
been
determined
to
go
on,
and
had
said
in
a
very
particular
way
indeed,
that
he
was
going
on
business
which
he
would
not
put
off
for
any
inducement
in
the
world;
and
something
about
a
very
enviable
commission,
and
being
the
bearer
of
something
exceedingly
precious.
Mr.
Perry
could
not
quite
understand
him,
but
he
was
very
sure
there
must
be
a
lady
in
the
case,
and
he
told
him
so;
and
Mr.
Elton
only
looked
very
conscious
and
smiling,
and
rode
off
in
great
spirits.
Miss
Nash
had
told
her
all
this,
and
had
talked
a
great
deal
more
about
Mr.
Elton;
and
said,
looking
so
very
significantly
at
her,
"that
she
did
not
pretend
to
understand
what
his
business
might
be,
but
she
only
knew
that
any
woman
whom
Mr.
Elton
could
prefer,
she
should
think
the
luckiest
woman
in
the
world;
for,
beyond
a
doubt,
Mr.
Elton
had
not
his
