Mrs.
Bird
and
Mrs.
James
Cooper;
and
of
more
than
I
can
enumerate.
Upon
my
word
it
is
enough
to
put
one
in
a
fright.
I
used
to
be
quite
angry
with
Selina;
but
really
I
begin
now
to
comprehend
that
a
married
woman
has
many
things
to
call
her
attention.
I
believe
I
was
half
an
hour
this
morning
shut
up
with
my
housekeeper."
"But
every
thing
of
that
kind,"
said
Emma,
"will
soon
be
in
so
regular
a
train
"
"Well,"
said
Mrs.
Elton,
laughing,
"we
shall
see."
Emma,
finding
her
so
determined
upon
neglecting
her
music,
had
nothing
more
to
say;
and,
after
a
moment's
pause,
Mrs.
Elton
chose
another
subject.
"We
have
been
calling
at
Randalls,"
said
she,
"and
found
them
both
at
home;
and
very
pleasant
people
they
seem
to
be.
I
like
them
extremely.
Mr.
Weston
seems
an
excellent
creature
quite
a
first
rate
favourite
with
me
already,
I
assure
you.
And
she
appears
so
truly
good
there
is
something
so
motherly
and
kind
hearted
about
her,
that
it
wins
upon
one
directly.
She
was
your
governess,
I
think?"
Emma
was
almost
too
much
astonished
to
answer;
but
Mrs.
Elton
hardly
waited
for
the
affirmative
before
she
went
on.
"Having
understood
as
much,
I
was
rather
astonished
to
find
her
so
very
lady
like!
But
she
is
really
quite
the
gentlewoman."
"Mrs.
Weston's
manners,"
said
Emma,
"were
always
particularly
good.
Their
propriety,
simplicity,
and
elegance,
would
make
them
the
safest
model
for
any
young
woman."
"And
who
do
you
think
came
in
while
we
were
there?"
Emma
was
quite
at
a
loss.
The
tone
implied
some
old
acquaintance
and
how
could
she
possibly
guess?
"Knightley!"
continued
Mrs.
Elton;
"Knightley
himself!
Was
not
it
lucky?
for,
not
being
within
when
he
called
the
other
day,
I
had
never
seen
him
before;
and
of
course,
as
so
particular
a
friend
of
Mr.
E.'s,
I
had
a
great
curiosity.
'My
friend
Knightley'
had
been
so
often
mentioned,
that
I
was
really
impatient
to
see
him;
and
I
must
do
my
caro
sposo
the
justice
to
say
that
he
need
not
be
ashamed
of
his
friend.
Knightley
is
quite
the
gentleman.
I
like
him
very
much.
Decidedly,
I
think,
a
very
gentleman
like
man."
Happily,
it
was
now
time
to
be
gone.
They
were
off;
and
Emma
could
breathe.
"Insufferable
woman!"
was
her
immediate
exclamation.
"Worse
than
I
had
supposed.
Absolutely
insufferable!
Knightley!
I
could
not
have
believed
it.
Knightley!
never
seen
him
in
her
life
before,
and
call
him
Knightley!
and
discover
that
he
is
a
gentleman!
A
little
upstart,
vulgar
being,
with
her
Mr.
E.,
and
her
caro
sposo,
and
her
resources,
and
all
her
airs
of
pert
pretension
and
underbred
finery.
Actually
to
discover
that
Mr.
Knightley
is
a
gentleman!
I
doubt
whether
he
will
return
the
compliment,
and
discover
her
to
be
a
lady.
I
could
not
have
believed
it!
And
to
propose
that
she
and
I
should
unite
to
form
a
musical
club!
