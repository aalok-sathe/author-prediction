such
assurance
of
accent,
such
boastful
pretence
of
amazement,
that
she
could
not
help
replying
with
quickness,
"Mr.
Elton,
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
conduct!
and
I
can
account
for
it
only
in
one
way;
you
are
not
yourself,
or
you
could
not
speak
either
to
me,
or
of
Harriet,
in
such
a
manner.
Command
yourself
enough
to
say
no
more,
and
I
will
endeavour
to
forget
it."
But
Mr.
Elton
had
only
drunk
wine
enough
to
elevate
his
spirits,
not
at
all
to
confuse
his
intellects.
He
perfectly
knew
his
own
meaning;
and
having
warmly
protested
against
her
suspicion
as
most
injurious,
and
slightly
touched
upon
his
respect
for
Miss
Smith
as
her
friend,
but
acknowledging
his
wonder
that
Miss
Smith
should
be
mentioned
at
all,
he
resumed
the
subject
of
his
own
passion,
and
was
very
urgent
for
a
favourable
answer.
As
she
thought
less
of
his
inebriety,
she
thought
more
of
his
inconstancy
and
presumption;
and
with
fewer
struggles
for
politeness,
replied,
"It
is
impossible
for
me
to
doubt
any
longer.
You
have
made
yourself
too
clear.
Mr.
Elton,
my
astonishment
is
much
beyond
any
thing
I
can
express.
After
such
behaviour,
as
I
have
witnessed
during
the
last
month,
to
Miss
Smith
such
attentions
as
I
have
been
in
the
daily
habit
of
observing
to
be
addressing
me
in
this
manner
this
is
an
unsteadiness
of
character,
indeed,
which
I
had
not
supposed
possible!
Believe
me,
sir,
I
am
far,
very
far,
from
gratified
in
being
the
object
of
such
professions."
"Good
Heaven!"
cried
Mr.
Elton,
"what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this?
Miss
Smith!
I
never
thought
of
Miss
Smith
in
the
whole
course
of
my
existence
never
paid
her
any
attentions,
but
as
your
friend:
never
cared
whether
she
were
dead
or
alive,
but
as
your
friend.
If
she
has
fancied
otherwise,
her
own
wishes
have
misled
her,
and
I
am
very
sorry
extremely
sorry
But,
Miss
Smith,
indeed!
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse!
who
can
think
of
Miss
Smith,
when
Miss
Woodhouse
is
near!
No,
upon
my
honour,
there
is
no
unsteadiness
of
character.
I
have
thought
only
of
you.
I
protest
against
having
paid
the
smallest
attention
to
any
one
else.
Every
thing
that
I
have
said
or
done,
for
many
weeks
past,
has
been
with
the
sole
view
of
marking
my
adoration
of
yourself.
You
cannot
really,
seriously,
doubt
it.
No!
(in
an
accent
meant
to
be
insinuating)
I
am
sure
you
have
seen
and
understood
me."
It
would
be
impossible
to
say
what
Emma
felt,
on
hearing
this
which
of
all
her
unpleasant
sensations
was
uppermost.
She
was
too
completely
overpowered
to
be
immediately
able
to
reply:
and
two
moments
of
silence
being
ample
encouragement
for
Mr.
Elton's
sanguine
state
of
mind,
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
again,
as
he
joyously
exclaimed
"Charming
Miss
Woodhouse!
allow
me
to
interpret
this
interesting
silence.
It
confesses
that
you
have
long
understood
me."
"No,
sir,"
cried
Emma,
"it
confesses
no
such
thing.
So
far
