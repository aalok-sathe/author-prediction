suitableness
of
the
match.
It
was
all
general
approbation
and
smoothness;
nothing
delineated
or
distinguished.
It
did
her
no
service
however.
Her
caution
was
thrown
away.
Emma
saw
its
artifice,
and
returned
to
her
first
surmises.
There
probably
was
something
more
to
conceal
than
her
own
preference;
Mr.
Dixon,
perhaps,
had
been
very
near
changing
one
friend
for
the
other,
or
been
fixed
only
to
Miss
Campbell,
for
the
sake
of
the
future
twelve
thousand
pounds.
The
like
reserve
prevailed
on
other
topics.
She
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
had
been
at
Weymouth
at
the
same
time.
It
was
known
that
they
were
a
little
acquainted;
but
not
a
syllable
of
real
information
could
Emma
procure
as
to
what
he
truly
was.
"Was
he
handsome?"
"She
believed
he
was
reckoned
a
very
fine
young
man."
"Was
he
agreeable?"
"He
was
generally
thought
so."
"Did
he
appear
a
sensible
young
man;
a
young
man
of
information?"
"At
a
watering
place,
or
in
a
common
London
acquaintance,
it
was
difficult
to
decide
on
such
points.
Manners
were
all
that
could
be
safely
judged
of,
under
a
much
longer
knowledge
than
they
had
yet
had
of
Mr.
Churchill.
She
believed
every
body
found
his
manners
pleasing."
Emma
could
not
forgive
her.
Emma
could
not
forgive
her;
but
as
neither
provocation
nor
resentment
were
discerned
by
Mr.
Knightley,
who
had
been
of
the
party,
and
had
seen
only
proper
attention
and
pleasing
behaviour
on
each
side,
he
was
expressing
the
next
morning,
being
at
Hartfield
again
on
business
with
Mr.
Woodhouse,
his
approbation
of
the
whole;
not
so
openly
as
he
might
have
done
had
her
father
been
out
of
the
room,
but
speaking
plain
enough
to
be
very
intelligible
to
Emma.
He
had
been
used
to
think
her
unjust
to
Jane,
and
had
now
great
pleasure
in
marking
an
improvement.
"A
very
pleasant
evening,"
he
began,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
talked
into
what
was
necessary,
told
that
he
understood,
and
the
papers
swept
away;
"particularly
pleasant.
You
and
Miss
Fairfax
gave
us
some
very
good
music.
I
do
not
know
a
more
luxurious
state,
sir,
than
sitting
at
one's
ease
to
be
entertained
a
whole
evening
by
two
such
young
women;
sometimes
with
music
and
sometimes
with
conversation.
I
am
sure
Miss
Fairfax
must
have
found
the
evening
pleasant,
Emma.
You
left
nothing
undone.
I
was
glad
you
made
her
play
so
much,
for
having
no
instrument
at
her
grandmother's,
it
must
have
been
a
real
indulgence."
"I
am
happy
you
approved,"
said
Emma,
smiling;
"but
I
hope
I
am
not
often
deficient
in
what
is
due
to
guests
at
Hartfield."
"No,
my
dear,"
said
her
father
instantly;
"that
I
am
sure
you
are
not.
There
is
nobody
half
so
attentive
and
civil
as
you
are.
If
any
thing,
you
are
too
attentive.
The
muffin
last
night
if
it
had
been
handed
round
once,
I
think
it
would
have
been
enough."
"No,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
nearly
at
the
same
time;
"you
