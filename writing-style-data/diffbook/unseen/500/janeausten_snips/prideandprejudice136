with
a
sigh.
"We
have
dined
nine
times
at
Rosings,
besides
drinking
tea
there
twice!
How
much
I
shall
have
to
tell!"
Elizabeth
added
privately,
"And
how
much
I
shall
have
to
conceal!"
Their
journey
was
performed
without
much
conversation,
or
any
alarm;
and
within
four
hours
of
their
leaving
Hunsford
they
reached
Mr.
Gardiner's
house,
where
they
were
to
remain
a
few
days.
Jane
looked
well,
and
Elizabeth
had
little
opportunity
of
studying
her
spirits,
amidst
the
various
engagements
which
the
kindness
of
her
aunt
had
reserved
for
them.
But
Jane
was
to
go
home
with
her,
and
at
Longbourn
there
would
be
leisure
enough
for
observation.
It
was
not
without
an
effort,
meanwhile,
that
she
could
wait
even
for
Longbourn,
before
she
told
her
sister
of
Mr.
Darcy's
proposals.
To
know
that
she
had
the
power
of
revealing
what
would
so
exceedingly
astonish
Jane,
and
must,
at
the
same
time,
so
highly
gratify
whatever
of
her
own
vanity
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
reason
away,
was
such
a
temptation
to
openness
as
nothing
could
have
conquered
but
the
state
of
indecision
in
which
she
remained
as
to
the
extent
of
what
she
should
communicate;
and
her
fear,
if
she
once
entered
on
the
subject,
of
being
hurried
into
repeating
something
of
Bingley
which
might
only
grieve
her
sister
further.
It
was
the
second
week
in
May,
in
which
the
three
young
ladies
set
out
together
from
Gracechurch
Street
for
the
town
of
,
in
Hertfordshire;
and,
as
they
drew
near
the
appointed
inn
where
Mr.
Bennet's
carriage
was
to
meet
them,
they
quickly
perceived,
in
token
of
the
coachman's
punctuality,
both
Kitty
and
Lydia
looking
out
of
a
dining
room
up
stairs.
These
two
girls
had
been
above
an
hour
in
the
place,
happily
employed
in
visiting
an
opposite
milliner,
watching
the
sentinel
on
guard,
and
dressing
a
salad
and
cucumber.
After
welcoming
their
sisters,
they
triumphantly
displayed
a
table
set
out
with
such
cold
meat
as
an
inn
larder
usually
affords,
exclaiming,
"Is
not
this
nice?
Is
not
this
an
agreeable
surprise?"
"And
we
mean
to
treat
you
all,"
added
Lydia,
"but
you
must
lend
us
the
money,
for
we
have
just
spent
ours
at
the
shop
out
there."
Then,
showing
her
purchases
"Look
here,
I
have
bought
this
bonnet.
I
do
not
think
it
is
very
pretty;
but
I
thought
I
might
as
well
buy
it
as
not.
I
shall
pull
it
to
pieces
as
soon
as
I
get
home,
and
see
if
I
can
make
it
up
any
better."
And
when
her
sisters
abused
it
as
ugly,
she
added,
with
perfect
unconcern,
"Oh!
but
there
were
two
or
three
much
uglier
in
the
shop;
and
when
I
have
bought
some
prettier
coloured
satin
to
trim
it
with
fresh,
I
think
it
will
be
very
tolerable.
Besides,
it
will
not
much
signify
what
one
wears
this
summer,
after
the
shire
have
left
Meryton,
and
they
are
going
in
a
fortnight."
"Are
they
indeed!"
cried
