to
receive
it,
and
accepted
in
return
three
thousand
pounds.
All
connection
between
us
seemed
now
dissolved.
I
thought
too
ill
of
him
to
invite
him
to
Pemberley,
or
admit
his
society
in
town.
In
town
I
believe
he
chiefly
lived,
but
his
studying
the
law
was
a
mere
pretence,
and
being
now
free
from
all
restraint,
his
life
was
a
life
of
idleness
and
dissipation.
For
about
three
years
I
heard
little
of
him;
but
on
the
decease
of
the
incumbent
of
the
living
which
had
been
designed
for
him,
he
applied
to
me
again
by
letter
for
the
presentation.
His
circumstances,
he
assured
me,
and
I
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
it,
were
exceedingly
bad.
He
had
found
the
law
a
most
unprofitable
study,
and
was
now
absolutely
resolved
on
being
ordained,
if
I
would
present
him
to
the
living
in
question
of
which
he
trusted
there
could
be
little
doubt,
as
he
was
well
assured
that
I
had
no
other
person
to
provide
for,
and
I
could
not
have
forgotten
my
revered
father's
intentions.
You
will
hardly
blame
me
for
refusing
to
comply
with
this
entreaty,
or
for
resisting
every
repetition
to
it.
His
resentment
was
in
proportion
to
the
distress
of
his
circumstances
and
he
was
doubtless
as
violent
in
his
abuse
of
me
to
others
as
in
his
reproaches
to
myself.
After
this
period
every
appearance
of
acquaintance
was
dropped.
How
he
lived
I
know
not.
But
last
summer
he
was
again
most
painfully
obtruded
on
my
notice.
"I
must
now
mention
a
circumstance
which
I
would
wish
to
forget
myself,
and
which
no
obligation
less
than
the
present
should
induce
me
to
unfold
to
any
human
being.
Having
said
thus
much,
I
feel
no
doubt
of
your
secrecy.
My
sister,
who
is
more
than
ten
years
my
junior,
was
left
to
the
guardianship
of
my
mother's
nephew,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
and
myself.
About
a
year
ago,
she
was
taken
from
school,
and
an
establishment
formed
for
her
in
London;
and
last
summer
she
went
with
the
lady
who
presided
over
it,
to
Ramsgate;
and
thither
also
went
Mr.
Wickham,
undoubtedly
by
design;
for
there
proved
to
have
been
a
prior
acquaintance
between
him
and
Mrs.
Younge,
in
whose
character
we
were
most
unhappily
deceived;
and
by
her
connivance
and
aid,
he
so
far
recommended
himself
to
Georgiana,
whose
affectionate
heart
retained
a
strong
impression
of
his
kindness
to
her
as
a
child,
that
she
was
persuaded
to
believe
herself
in
love,
and
to
consent
to
an
elopement.
She
was
then
but
fifteen,
which
must
be
her
excuse;
and
after
stating
her
imprudence,
I
am
happy
to
add,
that
I
owed
the
knowledge
of
it
to
herself.
I
joined
them
unexpectedly
a
day
or
two
before
the
intended
elopement,
and
then
Georgiana,
unable
to
support
the
idea
of
grieving
and
offending
a
brother
whom
she
almost
looked
up
to
as
a
father,
acknowledged
the
whole
to
me.
You
may
imagine
what
I
felt
and
how
I
