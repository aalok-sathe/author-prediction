all
his
family,
and,
I
believe,
considers
me
as
one
of
his
best
friends.
He
came
to
ask
me
whether
I
thought
it
would
be
imprudent
in
him
to
settle
so
early;
whether
I
thought
her
too
young:
in
short,
whether
I
approved
his
choice
altogether;
having
some
apprehension
perhaps
of
her
being
considered
(especially
since
your
making
so
much
of
her)
as
in
a
line
of
society
above
him.
I
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
he
said.
I
never
hear
better
sense
from
any
one
than
Robert
Martin.
He
always
speaks
to
the
purpose;
open,
straightforward,
and
very
well
judging.
He
told
me
every
thing;
his
circumstances
and
plans,
and
what
they
all
proposed
doing
in
the
event
of
his
marriage.
He
is
an
excellent
young
man,
both
as
son
and
brother.
I
had
no
hesitation
in
advising
him
to
marry.
He
proved
to
me
that
he
could
afford
it;
and
that
being
the
case,
I
was
convinced
he
could
not
do
better.
I
praised
the
fair
lady
too,
and
altogether
sent
him
away
very
happy.
If
he
had
never
esteemed
my
opinion
before,
he
would
have
thought
highly
of
me
then;
and,
I
dare
say,
left
the
house
thinking
me
the
best
friend
and
counsellor
man
ever
had.
This
happened
the
night
before
last.
Now,
as
we
may
fairly
suppose,
he
would
not
allow
much
time
to
pass
before
he
spoke
to
the
lady,
and
as
he
does
not
appear
to
have
spoken
yesterday,
it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
should
be
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
to
day;
and
she
may
be
detained
by
a
visitor,
without
thinking
him
at
all
a
tiresome
wretch."
"Pray,
Mr.
Knightley,"
said
Emma,
who
had
been
smiling
to
herself
through
a
great
part
of
this
speech,
"how
do
you
know
that
Mr.
Martin
did
not
speak
yesterday?"
"Certainly,"
replied
he,
surprized,
"I
do
not
absolutely
know
it;
but
it
may
be
inferred.
Was
not
she
the
whole
day
with
you?"
"Come,"
said
she,
"I
will
tell
you
something,
in
return
for
what
you
have
told
me.
He
did
speak
yesterday
that
is,
he
wrote,
and
was
refused."
This
was
obliged
to
be
repeated
before
it
could
be
believed;
and
Mr.
Knightley
actually
looked
red
with
surprize
and
displeasure,
as
he
stood
up,
in
tall
indignation,
and
said,
"Then
she
is
a
greater
simpleton
than
I
ever
believed
her.
What
is
the
foolish
girl
about?"
"Oh!
to
be
sure,"
cried
Emma,
"it
is
always
incomprehensible
to
a
man
that
a
woman
should
ever
refuse
an
offer
of
marriage.
A
man
always
imagines
a
woman
to
be
ready
for
any
body
who
asks
her."
"Nonsense!
a
man
does
not
imagine
any
such
thing.
But
what
is
the
meaning
of
this?
Harriet
Smith
refuse
Robert
Martin?
madness,
if
it
is
so;
but
I
hope
you
are
mistaken."
"I
saw
her
answer!
nothing
could
be
clearer."
"You
saw
her
answer!
you
wrote
her
answer
too.
Emma,
this
is
your
doing.
You
persuaded
her
to
refuse
