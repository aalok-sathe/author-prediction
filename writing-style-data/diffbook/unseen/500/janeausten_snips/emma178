out
so.
As
for
Mr.
Elton,
his
manners
did
not
appear
but
no,
she
would
not
permit
a
hasty
or
a
witty
word
from
herself
about
his
manners.
It
was
an
awkward
ceremony
at
any
time
to
be
receiving
wedding
visits,
and
a
man
had
need
be
all
grace
to
acquit
himself
well
through
it.
The
woman
was
better
off;
she
might
have
the
assistance
of
fine
clothes,
and
the
privilege
of
bashfulness,
but
the
man
had
only
his
own
good
sense
to
depend
on;
and
when
she
considered
how
peculiarly
unlucky
poor
Mr.
Elton
was
in
being
in
the
same
room
at
once
with
the
woman
he
had
just
married,
the
woman
he
had
wanted
to
marry,
and
the
woman
whom
he
had
been
expected
to
marry,
she
must
allow
him
to
have
the
right
to
look
as
little
wise,
and
to
be
as
much
affectedly,
and
as
little
really
easy
as
could
be.
"Well,
Miss
Woodhouse,"
said
Harriet,
when
they
had
quitted
the
house,
and
after
waiting
in
vain
for
her
friend
to
begin;
"Well,
Miss
Woodhouse,
(with
a
gentle
sigh,)
what
do
you
think
of
her?
Is
not
she
very
charming?"
There
was
a
little
hesitation
in
Emma's
answer.
"Oh!
yes
very
a
very
pleasing
young
woman."
"I
think
her
beautiful,
quite
beautiful."
"Very
nicely
dressed,
indeed;
a
remarkably
elegant
gown."
"I
am
not
at
all
surprized
that
he
should
have
fallen
in
love."
"Oh!
no
there
is
nothing
to
surprize
one
at
all.
A
pretty
fortune;
and
she
came
in
his
way."
"I
dare
say,"
returned
Harriet,
sighing
again,
"I
dare
say
she
was
very
much
attached
to
him."
"Perhaps
she
might;
but
it
is
not
every
man's
fate
to
marry
the
woman
who
loves
him
best.
Miss
Hawkins
perhaps
wanted
a
home,
and
thought
this
the
best
offer
she
was
likely
to
have."
"Yes,"
said
Harriet
earnestly,
"and
well
she
might,
nobody
could
ever
have
a
better.
Well,
I
wish
them
happy
with
all
my
heart.
And
now,
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
do
not
think
I
shall
mind
seeing
them
again.
He
is
just
as
superior
as
ever;
but
being
married,
you
know,
it
is
quite
a
different
thing.
No,
indeed,
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
need
not
be
afraid;
I
can
sit
and
admire
him
now
without
any
great
misery.
To
know
that
he
has
not
thrown
himself
away,
is
such
a
comfort!
She
does
seem
a
charming
young
woman,
just
what
he
deserves.
Happy
creature!
He
called
her
'Augusta.'
How
delightful!"
When
the
visit
was
returned,
Emma
made
up
her
mind.
She
could
then
see
more
and
judge
better.
From
Harriet's
happening
not
to
be
at
Hartfield,
and
her
father's
being
present
to
engage
Mr.
Elton,
she
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
lady's
conversation
to
herself,
and
could
composedly
attend
to
her;
and
the
quarter
of
an
hour
quite
convinced
her
that
Mrs.
Elton
was
a
vain
woman,
extremely
well
satisfied
with
herself,
and
thinking
much
of
her
own
importance;
that
she
meant
