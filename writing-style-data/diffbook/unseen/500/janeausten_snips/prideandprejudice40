to
know
to
which
of
his
fair
cousins
the
excellency
of
its
cooking
was
owing.
But
he
was
set
right
there
by
Mrs.
Bennet,
who
assured
him
with
some
asperity
that
they
were
very
well
able
to
keep
a
good
cook,
and
that
her
daughters
had
nothing
to
do
in
the
kitchen.
He
begged
pardon
for
having
displeased
her.
In
a
softened
tone
she
declared
herself
not
at
all
offended;
but
he
continued
to
apologise
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour.
During
dinner,
Mr.
Bennet
scarcely
spoke
at
all;
but
when
the
servants
were
withdrawn,
he
thought
it
time
to
have
some
conversation
with
his
guest,
and
therefore
started
a
subject
in
which
he
expected
him
to
shine,
by
observing
that
he
seemed
very
fortunate
in
his
patroness.
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh's
attention
to
his
wishes,
and
consideration
for
his
comfort,
appeared
very
remarkable.
Mr.
Bennet
could
not
have
chosen
better.
Mr.
Collins
was
eloquent
in
her
praise.
The
subject
elevated
him
to
more
than
usual
solemnity
of
manner,
and
with
a
most
important
aspect
he
protested
that
"he
had
never
in
his
life
witnessed
such
behaviour
in
a
person
of
rank
such
affability
and
condescension,
as
he
had
himself
experienced
from
Lady
Catherine.
She
had
been
graciously
pleased
to
approve
of
both
of
the
discourses
which
he
had
already
had
the
honour
of
preaching
before
her.
She
had
also
asked
him
twice
to
dine
at
Rosings,
and
had
sent
for
him
only
the
Saturday
before,
to
make
up
her
pool
of
quadrille
in
the
evening.
Lady
Catherine
was
reckoned
proud
by
many
people
he
knew,
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
but
affability
in
her.
She
had
always
spoken
to
him
as
she
would
to
any
other
gentleman;
she
made
not
the
smallest
objection
to
his
joining
in
the
society
of
the
neighbourhood
nor
to
his
leaving
the
parish
occasionally
for
a
week
or
two,
to
visit
his
relations.
She
had
even
condescended
to
advise
him
to
marry
as
soon
as
he
could,
provided
he
chose
with
discretion;
and
had
once
paid
him
a
visit
in
his
humble
parsonage,
where
she
had
perfectly
approved
all
the
alterations
he
had
been
making,
and
had
even
vouchsafed
to
suggest
some
herself
some
shelves
in
the
closet
up
stairs."
"That
is
all
very
proper
and
civil,
I
am
sure,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet,
"and
I
dare
say
she
is
a
very
agreeable
woman.
It
is
a
pity
that
great
ladies
in
general
are
not
more
like
her.
Does
she
live
near
you,
sir?"
"The
garden
in
which
stands
my
humble
abode
is
separated
only
by
a
lane
from
Rosings
Park,
her
ladyship's
residence."
"I
think
you
said
she
was
a
widow,
sir?
Has
she
any
family?"
"She
has
only
one
daughter,
the
heiress
of
Rosings,
and
of
very
extensive
property."
"Ah!"
said
Mrs.
Bennet,
shaking
her
head,
"then
she
is
better
off
than
many
girls.
And
what
sort
of
young
lady
is
she?
Is
she
handsome?"
"She
is
a
most
charming
young
