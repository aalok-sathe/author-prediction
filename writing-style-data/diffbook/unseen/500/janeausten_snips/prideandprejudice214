Mr.
Darcy
was
almost
as
far
from
her
as
the
table
could
divide
them.
He
was
on
one
side
of
her
mother.
She
knew
how
little
such
a
situation
would
give
pleasure
to
either,
or
make
either
appear
to
advantage.
She
was
not
near
enough
to
hear
any
of
their
discourse,
but
she
could
see
how
seldom
they
spoke
to
each
other,
and
how
formal
and
cold
was
their
manner
whenever
they
did.
Her
mother's
ungraciousness,
made
the
sense
of
what
they
owed
him
more
painful
to
Elizabeth's
mind;
and
she
would,
at
times,
have
given
anything
to
be
privileged
to
tell
him
that
his
kindness
was
neither
unknown
nor
unfelt
by
the
whole
of
the
family.
She
was
in
hopes
that
the
evening
would
afford
some
opportunity
of
bringing
them
together;
that
the
whole
of
the
visit
would
not
pass
away
without
enabling
them
to
enter
into
something
more
of
conversation
than
the
mere
ceremonious
salutation
attending
his
entrance.
Anxious
and
uneasy,
the
period
which
passed
in
the
drawing
room,
before
the
gentlemen
came,
was
wearisome
and
dull
to
a
degree
that
almost
made
her
uncivil.
She
looked
forward
to
their
entrance
as
the
point
on
which
all
her
chance
of
pleasure
for
the
evening
must
depend.
"If
he
does
not
come
to
me,
then,"
said
she,
"I
shall
give
him
up
for
ever."
The
gentlemen
came;
and
she
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
answered
her
hopes;
but,
alas!
the
ladies
had
crowded
round
the
table,
where
Miss
Bennet
was
making
tea,
and
Elizabeth
pouring
out
the
coffee,
in
so
close
a
confederacy
that
there
was
not
a
single
vacancy
near
her
which
would
admit
of
a
chair.
And
on
the
gentlemen's
approaching,
one
of
the
girls
moved
closer
to
her
than
ever,
and
said,
in
a
whisper:
"The
men
shan't
come
and
part
us,
I
am
determined.
We
want
none
of
them;
do
we?"
Darcy
had
walked
away
to
another
part
of
the
room.
She
followed
him
with
her
eyes,
envied
everyone
to
whom
he
spoke,
had
scarcely
patience
enough
to
help
anybody
to
coffee;
and
then
was
enraged
against
herself
for
being
so
silly!
"A
man
who
has
once
been
refused!
How
could
I
ever
be
foolish
enough
to
expect
a
renewal
of
his
love?
Is
there
one
among
the
sex,
who
would
not
protest
against
such
a
weakness
as
a
second
proposal
to
the
same
woman?
There
is
no
indignity
so
abhorrent
to
their
feelings!"
She
was
a
little
revived,
however,
by
his
bringing
back
his
coffee
cup
himself;
and
she
seized
the
opportunity
of
saying:
"Is
your
sister
at
Pemberley
still?"
"Yes,
she
will
remain
there
till
Christmas."
"And
quite
alone?
Have
all
her
friends
left
her?"
"Mrs.
Annesley
is
with
her.
The
others
have
been
gone
on
to
Scarborough,
these
three
weeks."
She
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
say;
but
if
he
wished
to
converse
with
her,
he
might
have
better
success.
He
stood
by
her,
however,
for
some
minutes,
