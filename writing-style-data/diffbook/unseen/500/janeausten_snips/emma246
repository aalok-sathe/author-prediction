never
guess.
I
will
tell
you.
M.
and
A.
Em
ma.
Do
you
understand?"
Understanding
and
gratification
came
together.
It
might
be
a
very
indifferent
piece
of
wit,
but
Emma
found
a
great
deal
to
laugh
at
and
enjoy
in
it
and
so
did
Frank
and
Harriet.
It
did
not
seem
to
touch
the
rest
of
the
party
equally;
some
looked
very
stupid
about
it,
and
Mr.
Knightley
gravely
said,
"This
explains
the
sort
of
clever
thing
that
is
wanted,
and
Mr.
Weston
has
done
very
well
for
himself;
but
he
must
have
knocked
up
every
body
else.
Perfection
should
not
have
come
quite
so
soon."
"Oh!
for
myself,
I
protest
I
must
be
excused,"
said
Mrs.
Elton;
"I
really
cannot
attempt
I
am
not
at
all
fond
of
the
sort
of
thing.
I
had
an
acrostic
once
sent
to
me
upon
my
own
name,
which
I
was
not
at
all
pleased
with.
I
knew
who
it
came
from.
An
abominable
puppy!
You
know
who
I
mean
(nodding
to
her
husband).
These
kind
of
things
are
very
well
at
Christmas,
when
one
is
sitting
round
the
fire;
but
quite
out
of
place,
in
my
opinion,
when
one
is
exploring
about
the
country
in
summer.
Miss
Woodhouse
must
excuse
me.
I
am
not
one
of
those
who
have
witty
things
at
every
body's
service.
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
wit.
I
have
a
great
deal
of
vivacity
in
my
own
way,
but
I
really
must
be
allowed
to
judge
when
to
speak
and
when
to
hold
my
tongue.
Pass
us,
if
you
please,
Mr.
Churchill.
Pass
Mr.
E.,
Knightley,
Jane,
and
myself.
We
have
nothing
clever
to
say
not
one
of
us.
"Yes,
yes,
pray
pass
me,"
added
her
husband,
with
a
sort
of
sneering
consciousness;
"I
have
nothing
to
say
that
can
entertain
Miss
Woodhouse,
or
any
other
young
lady.
An
old
married
man
quite
good
for
nothing.
Shall
we
walk,
Augusta?"
"With
all
my
heart.
I
am
really
tired
of
exploring
so
long
on
one
spot.
Come,
Jane,
take
my
other
arm."
Jane
declined
it,
however,
and
the
husband
and
wife
walked
off.
"Happy
couple!"
said
Frank
Churchill,
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing:
"How
well
they
suit
one
another!
Very
lucky
marrying
as
they
did,
upon
an
acquaintance
formed
only
in
a
public
place!
They
only
knew
each
other,
I
think,
a
few
weeks
in
Bath!
Peculiarly
lucky!
for
as
to
any
real
knowledge
of
a
person's
disposition
that
Bath,
or
any
public
place,
can
give
it
is
all
nothing;
there
can
be
no
knowledge.
It
is
only
by
seeing
women
in
their
own
homes,
among
their
own
set,
just
as
they
always
are,
that
you
can
form
any
just
judgment.
Short
of
that,
it
is
all
guess
and
luck
and
will
generally
be
ill
luck.
How
many
a
man
has
committed
himself
on
a
short
acquaintance,
and
rued
it
all
the
rest
of
his
life!"
Miss
Fairfax,
who
had
seldom
spoken
before,
except
