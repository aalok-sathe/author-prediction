said
she,
'you
have
given
me
a
treasure.'
Are
any
of
your
younger
sisters
out,
Miss
Bennet?"
"Yes,
ma'am,
all."
"All!
What,
all
five
out
at
once?
Very
odd!
And
you
only
the
second.
The
younger
ones
out
before
the
elder
ones
are
married!
Your
younger
sisters
must
be
very
young?"
"Yes,
my
youngest
is
not
sixteen.
Perhaps
she
is
full
young
to
be
much
in
company.
But
really,
ma'am,
I
think
it
would
be
very
hard
upon
younger
sisters,
that
they
should
not
have
their
share
of
society
and
amusement,
because
the
elder
may
not
have
the
means
or
inclination
to
marry
early.
The
last
born
has
as
good
a
right
to
the
pleasures
of
youth
as
the
first.
And
to
be
kept
back
on
such
a
motive!
I
think
it
would
not
be
very
likely
to
promote
sisterly
affection
or
delicacy
of
mind."
"Upon
my
word,"
said
her
ladyship,
"you
give
your
opinion
very
decidedly
for
so
young
a
person.
Pray,
what
is
your
age?"
"With
three
younger
sisters
grown
up,"
replied
Elizabeth,
smiling,
"your
ladyship
can
hardly
expect
me
to
own
it."
Lady
Catherine
seemed
quite
astonished
at
not
receiving
a
direct
answer;
and
Elizabeth
suspected
herself
to
be
the
first
creature
who
had
ever
dared
to
trifle
with
so
much
dignified
impertinence.
"You
cannot
be
more
than
twenty,
I
am
sure,
therefore
you
need
not
conceal
your
age."
"I
am
not
one
and
twenty."
When
the
gentlemen
had
joined
them,
and
tea
was
over,
the
card
tables
were
placed.
Lady
Catherine,
Sir
William,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
sat
down
to
quadrille;
and
as
Miss
de
Bourgh
chose
to
play
at
cassino,
the
two
girls
had
the
honour
of
assisting
Mrs.
Jenkinson
to
make
up
her
party.
Their
table
was
superlatively
stupid.
Scarcely
a
syllable
was
uttered
that
did
not
relate
to
the
game,
except
when
Mrs.
Jenkinson
expressed
her
fears
of
Miss
de
Bourgh's
being
too
hot
or
too
cold,
or
having
too
much
or
too
little
light.
A
great
deal
more
passed
at
the
other
table.
Lady
Catherine
was
generally
speaking
stating
the
mistakes
of
the
three
others,
or
relating
some
anecdote
of
herself.
Mr.
Collins
was
employed
in
agreeing
to
everything
her
ladyship
said,
thanking
her
for
every
fish
he
won,
and
apologising
if
he
thought
he
won
too
many.
Sir
William
did
not
say
much.
He
was
storing
his
memory
with
anecdotes
and
noble
names.
When
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
had
played
as
long
as
they
chose,
the
tables
were
broken
up,
the
carriage
was
offered
to
Mrs.
Collins,
gratefully
accepted
and
immediately
ordered.
The
party
then
gathered
round
the
fire
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
determine
what
weather
they
were
to
have
on
the
morrow.
From
these
instructions
they
were
summoned
by
the
arrival
of
the
coach;
and
with
many
speeches
of
thankfulness
on
Mr.
Collins's
side
and
as
many
bows
on
Sir
William's
they
departed.
As
soon
as
they
had
driven
from
the
door,
Elizabeth
was
called
on
by
her
