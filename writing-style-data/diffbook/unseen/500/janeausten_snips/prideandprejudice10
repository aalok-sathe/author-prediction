his
family
to
a
house
about
a
mile
from
Meryton,
denominated
from
that
period
Lucas
Lodge,
where
he
could
think
with
pleasure
of
his
own
importance,
and,
unshackled
by
business,
occupy
himself
solely
in
being
civil
to
all
the
world.
For,
though
elated
by
his
rank,
it
did
not
render
him
supercilious;
on
the
contrary,
he
was
all
attention
to
everybody.
By
nature
inoffensive,
friendly,
and
obliging,
his
presentation
at
St.
James's
had
made
him
courteous.
Lady
Lucas
was
a
very
good
kind
of
woman,
not
too
clever
to
be
a
valuable
neighbour
to
Mrs.
Bennet.
They
had
several
children.
The
eldest
of
them,
a
sensible,
intelligent
young
woman,
about
twenty
seven,
was
Elizabeth's
intimate
friend.
That
the
Miss
Lucases
and
the
Miss
Bennets
should
meet
to
talk
over
a
ball
was
absolutely
necessary;
and
the
morning
after
the
assembly
brought
the
former
to
Longbourn
to
hear
and
to
communicate.
"You
began
the
evening
well,
Charlotte,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet
with
civil
self
command
to
Miss
Lucas.
"You
were
Mr.
Bingley's
first
choice."
"Yes;
but
he
seemed
to
like
his
second
better."
"Oh!
you
mean
Jane,
I
suppose,
because
he
danced
with
her
twice.
To
be
sure
that
did
seem
as
if
he
admired
her
indeed
I
rather
believe
he
did
I
heard
something
about
it
but
I
hardly
know
what
something
about
Mr.
Robinson."
"Perhaps
you
mean
what
I
overheard
between
him
and
Mr.
Robinson;
did
not
I
mention
it
to
you?
Mr.
Robinson's
asking
him
how
he
liked
our
Meryton
assemblies,
and
whether
he
did
not
think
there
were
a
great
many
pretty
women
in
the
room,
and
which
he
thought
the
prettiest?
and
his
answering
immediately
to
the
last
question:
'Oh!
the
eldest
Miss
Bennet,
beyond
a
doubt;
there
cannot
be
two
opinions
on
that
point.'"
"Upon
my
word!
Well,
that
is
very
decided
indeed
that
does
seem
as
if
but,
however,
it
may
all
come
to
nothing,
you
know."
"My
overhearings
were
more
to
the
purpose
than
yours,
Eliza,"
said
Charlotte.
"Mr.
Darcy
is
not
so
well
worth
listening
to
as
his
friend,
is
he?
poor
Eliza!
to
be
only
just
tolerable."
"I
beg
you
would
not
put
it
into
Lizzy's
head
to
be
vexed
by
his
ill
treatment,
for
he
is
such
a
disagreeable
man,
that
it
would
be
quite
a
misfortune
to
be
liked
by
him.
Mrs.
Long
told
me
last
night
that
he
sat
close
to
her
for
half
an
hour
without
once
opening
his
lips."
"Are
you
quite
sure,
ma'am?
is
not
there
a
little
mistake?"
said
Jane.
"I
certainly
saw
Mr.
Darcy
speaking
to
her."
"Aye
because
she
asked
him
at
last
how
he
liked
Netherfield,
and
he
could
not
help
answering
her;
but
she
said
he
seemed
quite
angry
at
being
spoke
to."
"Miss
Bingley
told
me,"
said
Jane,
"that
he
never
speaks
much,
unless
among
his
intimate
acquaintances.
With
them
he
is
remarkably
agreeable."
"I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it,
my
dear.
If
he
had
been
so
very
