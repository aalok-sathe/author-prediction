wonder,
of
Mr.
Darcy's
civility,
and,
above
all,
of
his
wishing
her
to
be
acquainted
with
his
sister.
Elizabeth
had
settled
it
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
bring
his
sister
to
visit
her
the
very
day
after
her
reaching
Pemberley;
and
was
consequently
resolved
not
to
be
out
of
sight
of
the
inn
the
whole
of
that
morning.
But
her
conclusion
was
false;
for
on
the
very
morning
after
their
arrival
at
Lambton,
these
visitors
came.
They
had
been
walking
about
the
place
with
some
of
their
new
friends,
and
were
just
returning
to
the
inn
to
dress
themselves
for
dining
with
the
same
family,
when
the
sound
of
a
carriage
drew
them
to
a
window,
and
they
saw
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
in
a
curricle
driving
up
the
street.
Elizabeth
immediately
recognizing
the
livery,
guessed
what
it
meant,
and
imparted
no
small
degree
of
her
surprise
to
her
relations
by
acquainting
them
with
the
honour
which
she
expected.
Her
uncle
and
aunt
were
all
amazement;
and
the
embarrassment
of
her
manner
as
she
spoke,
joined
to
the
circumstance
itself,
and
many
of
the
circumstances
of
the
preceding
day,
opened
to
them
a
new
idea
on
the
business.
Nothing
had
ever
suggested
it
before,
but
they
felt
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
such
attentions
from
such
a
quarter
than
by
supposing
a
partiality
for
their
niece.
While
these
newly
born
notions
were
passing
in
their
heads,
the
perturbation
of
Elizabeth's
feelings
was
at
every
moment
increasing.
She
was
quite
amazed
at
her
own
discomposure;
but
amongst
other
causes
of
disquiet,
she
dreaded
lest
the
partiality
of
the
brother
should
have
said
too
much
in
her
favour;
and,
more
than
commonly
anxious
to
please,
she
naturally
suspected
that
every
power
of
pleasing
would
fail
her.
She
retreated
from
the
window,
fearful
of
being
seen;
and
as
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room,
endeavouring
to
compose
herself,
saw
such
looks
of
inquiring
surprise
in
her
uncle
and
aunt
as
made
everything
worse.
Miss
Darcy
and
her
brother
appeared,
and
this
formidable
introduction
took
place.
With
astonishment
did
Elizabeth
see
that
her
new
acquaintance
was
at
least
as
much
embarrassed
as
herself.
Since
her
being
at
Lambton,
she
had
heard
that
Miss
Darcy
was
exceedingly
proud;
but
the
observation
of
a
very
few
minutes
convinced
her
that
she
was
only
exceedingly
shy.
She
found
it
difficult
to
obtain
even
a
word
from
her
beyond
a
monosyllable.
Miss
Darcy
was
tall,
and
on
a
larger
scale
than
Elizabeth;
and,
though
little
more
than
sixteen,
her
figure
was
formed,
and
her
appearance
womanly
and
graceful.
She
was
less
handsome
than
her
brother;
but
there
was
sense
and
good
humour
in
her
face,
and
her
manners
were
perfectly
unassuming
and
gentle.
Elizabeth,
who
had
expected
to
find
in
her
as
acute
and
unembarrassed
an
observer
as
ever
Mr.
Darcy
had
been,
was
much
relieved
by
discerning
such
different
feelings.
They
had
not
long
been
together
before
Mr.
Darcy
told
her
that
