to
be
met
with
in
the
country
as
in
the
town,
which
you
must
acknowledge
to
be
true."
"Certainly,
my
dear,
nobody
said
there
were;
but
as
to
not
meeting
with
many
people
in
this
neighbourhood,
I
believe
there
are
few
neighbourhoods
larger.
I
know
we
dine
with
four
and
twenty
families."
Nothing
but
concern
for
Elizabeth
could
enable
Bingley
to
keep
his
countenance.
His
sister
was
less
delicate,
and
directed
her
eyes
towards
Mr.
Darcy
with
a
very
expressive
smile.
Elizabeth,
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
that
might
turn
her
mother's
thoughts,
now
asked
her
if
Charlotte
Lucas
had
been
at
Longbourn
since
her
coming
away.
"Yes,
she
called
yesterday
with
her
father.
What
an
agreeable
man
Sir
William
is,
Mr.
Bingley,
is
not
he?
So
much
the
man
of
fashion!
So
genteel
and
easy!
He
has
always
something
to
say
to
everybody.
That
is
my
idea
of
good
breeding;
and
those
persons
who
fancy
themselves
very
important,
and
never
open
their
mouths,
quite
mistake
the
matter."
"Did
Charlotte
dine
with
you?"
"No,
she
would
go
home.
I
fancy
she
was
wanted
about
the
mince
pies.
For
my
part,
Mr.
Bingley,
I
always
keep
servants
that
can
do
their
own
work;
my
daughters
are
brought
up
very
differently.
But
everybody
is
to
judge
for
themselves,
and
the
Lucases
are
a
very
good
sort
of
girls,
I
assure
you.
It
is
a
pity
they
are
not
handsome!
Not
that
I
think
Charlotte
so
very
plain
but
then
she
is
our
particular
friend."
"She
seems
a
very
pleasant
young
woman."
"Oh!
dear,
yes;
but
you
must
own
she
is
very
plain.
Lady
Lucas
herself
has
often
said
so,
and
envied
me
Jane's
beauty.
I
do
not
like
to
boast
of
my
own
child,
but
to
be
sure,
Jane
one
does
not
often
see
anybody
better
looking.
It
is
what
everybody
says.
I
do
not
trust
my
own
partiality.
When
she
was
only
fifteen,
there
was
a
man
at
my
brother
Gardiner's
in
town
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
my
sister
in
law
was
sure
he
would
make
her
an
offer
before
we
came
away.
But,
however,
he
did
not.
Perhaps
he
thought
her
too
young.
However,
he
wrote
some
verses
on
her,
and
very
pretty
they
were."
"And
so
ended
his
affection,"
said
Elizabeth
impatiently.
"There
has
been
many
a
one,
I
fancy,
overcome
in
the
same
way.
I
wonder
who
first
discovered
the
efficacy
of
poetry
in
driving
away
love!"
"I
have
been
used
to
consider
poetry
as
the
food
of
love,"
said
Darcy.
"Of
a
fine,
stout,
healthy
love
it
may.
Everything
nourishes
what
is
strong
already.
But
if
it
be
only
a
slight,
thin
sort
of
inclination,
I
am
convinced
that
one
good
sonnet
will
starve
it
entirely
away."
Darcy
only
smiled;
and
the
general
pause
which
ensued
made
Elizabeth
tremble
lest
her
mother
should
be
exposing
herself
again.
She
longed
to
speak,
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say;
and
after
a
short
silence
