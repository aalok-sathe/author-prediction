all;
and
felt
some
curiosity
to
know
whether
the
wet
walk
of
this
morning
had
produced
any.
She
suspected
that
it
had;
that
it
would
not
have
been
so
resolutely
encountered
but
in
full
expectation
of
hearing
from
some
one
very
dear,
and
that
it
had
not
been
in
vain.
She
thought
there
was
an
air
of
greater
happiness
than
usual
a
glow
both
of
complexion
and
spirits.
She
could
have
made
an
inquiry
or
two,
as
to
the
expedition
and
the
expense
of
the
Irish
mails;
it
was
at
her
tongue's
end
but
she
abstained.
She
was
quite
determined
not
to
utter
a
word
that
should
hurt
Jane
Fairfax's
feelings;
and
they
followed
the
other
ladies
out
of
the
room,
arm
in
arm,
with
an
appearance
of
good
will
highly
becoming
to
the
beauty
and
grace
of
each.
When
the
ladies
returned
to
the
drawing
room
after
dinner,
Emma
found
it
hardly
possible
to
prevent
their
making
two
distinct
parties;
with
so
much
perseverance
in
judging
and
behaving
ill
did
Mrs.
Elton
engross
Jane
Fairfax
and
slight
herself.
She
and
Mrs.
Weston
were
obliged
to
be
almost
always
either
talking
together
or
silent
together.
Mrs.
Elton
left
them
no
choice.
If
Jane
repressed
her
for
a
little
time,
she
soon
began
again;
and
though
much
that
passed
between
them
was
in
a
half
whisper,
especially
on
Mrs.
Elton's
side,
there
was
no
avoiding
a
knowledge
of
their
principal
subjects:
The
post
office
catching
cold
fetching
letters
and
friendship,
were
long
under
discussion;
and
to
them
succeeded
one,
which
must
be
at
least
equally
unpleasant
to
Jane
inquiries
whether
she
had
yet
heard
of
any
situation
likely
to
suit
her,
and
professions
of
Mrs.
Elton's
meditated
activity.
"Here
is
April
come!"
said
she,
"I
get
quite
anxious
about
you.
June
will
soon
be
here."
"But
I
have
never
fixed
on
June
or
any
other
month
merely
looked
forward
to
the
summer
in
general."
"But
have
you
really
heard
of
nothing?"
"I
have
not
even
made
any
inquiry;
I
do
not
wish
to
make
any
yet."
"Oh!
my
dear,
we
cannot
begin
too
early;
you
are
not
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
procuring
exactly
the
desirable
thing."
"I
not
aware!"
said
Jane,
shaking
her
head;
"dear
Mrs.
Elton,
who
can
have
thought
of
it
as
I
have
done?"
"But
you
have
not
seen
so
much
of
the
world
as
I
have.
You
do
not
know
how
many
candidates
there
always
are
for
the
first
situations.
I
saw
a
vast
deal
of
that
in
the
neighbourhood
round
Maple
Grove.
A
cousin
of
Mr.
Suckling,
Mrs.
Bragge,
had
such
an
infinity
of
applications;
every
body
was
anxious
to
be
in
her
family,
for
she
moves
in
the
first
circle.
Wax
candles
in
the
schoolroom!
You
may
imagine
how
desirable!
Of
all
houses
in
the
kingdom
Mrs.
Bragge's
is
the
one
I
would
most
wish
to
see
you
in."
"Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
are
to
be
in
town
again
by
midsummer,"
said
Jane.
"I
