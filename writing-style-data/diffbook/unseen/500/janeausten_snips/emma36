are
all
doing
whether
his
sisters
know
if
he
is
unhappy,
they
will
be
unhappy
too.
I
hope
he
will
not
mind
it
so
very
much."
"Let
us
think
of
those
among
our
absent
friends
who
are
more
cheerfully
employed,"
cried
Emma.
"At
this
moment,
perhaps,
Mr.
Elton
is
shewing
your
picture
to
his
mother
and
sisters,
telling
how
much
more
beautiful
is
the
original,
and
after
being
asked
for
it
five
or
six
times,
allowing
them
to
hear
your
name,
your
own
dear
name."
"My
picture!
But
he
has
left
my
picture
in
Bond
street."
"Has
he
so!
Then
I
know
nothing
of
Mr.
Elton.
No,
my
dear
little
modest
Harriet,
depend
upon
it
the
picture
will
not
be
in
Bond
street
till
just
before
he
mounts
his
horse
to
morrow.
It
is
his
companion
all
this
evening,
his
solace,
his
delight.
It
opens
his
designs
to
his
family,
it
introduces
you
among
them,
it
diffuses
through
the
party
those
pleasantest
feelings
of
our
nature,
eager
curiosity
and
warm
prepossession.
How
cheerful,
how
animated,
how
suspicious,
how
busy
their
imaginations
all
are!"
Harriet
smiled
again,
and
her
smiles
grew
stronger.
Harriet
slept
at
Hartfield
that
night.
For
some
weeks
past
she
had
been
spending
more
than
half
her
time
there,
and
gradually
getting
to
have
a
bed
room
appropriated
to
herself;
and
Emma
judged
it
best
in
every
respect,
safest
and
kindest,
to
keep
her
with
them
as
much
as
possible
just
at
present.
She
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
morning
for
an
hour
or
two
to
Mrs.
Goddard's,
but
it
was
then
to
be
settled
that
she
should
return
to
Hartfield,
to
make
a
regular
visit
of
some
days.
While
she
was
gone,
Mr.
Knightley
called,
and
sat
some
time
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
and
Emma,
till
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
had
previously
made
up
his
mind
to
walk
out,
was
persuaded
by
his
daughter
not
to
defer
it,
and
was
induced
by
the
entreaties
of
both,
though
against
the
scruples
of
his
own
civility,
to
leave
Mr.
Knightley
for
that
purpose.
Mr.
Knightley,
who
had
nothing
of
ceremony
about
him,
was
offering
by
his
short,
decided
answers,
an
amusing
contrast
to
the
protracted
apologies
and
civil
hesitations
of
the
other.
"Well,
I
believe,
if
you
will
excuse
me,
Mr.
Knightley,
if
you
will
not
consider
me
as
doing
a
very
rude
thing,
I
shall
take
Emma's
advice
and
go
out
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour.
As
the
sun
is
out,
I
believe
I
had
better
take
my
three
turns
while
I
can.
I
treat
you
without
ceremony,
Mr.
Knightley.
We
invalids
think
we
are
privileged
people."
"My
dear
sir,
do
not
make
a
stranger
of
me."
"I
leave
an
excellent
substitute
in
my
daughter.
Emma
will
be
happy
to
entertain
you.
And
therefore
I
think
I
will
beg
your
excuse
and
take
my
three
turns
my
winter
walk."
"You
cannot
do
better,
sir."
"I
would
ask
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company,
Mr.
Knightley,
but
I
am
