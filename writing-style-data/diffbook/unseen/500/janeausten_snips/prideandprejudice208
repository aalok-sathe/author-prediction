if
he
likes
it.
And
who
knows
what
may
happen?
But
that
is
nothing
to
us.
You
know,
sister,
we
agreed
long
ago
never
to
mention
a
word
about
it.
And
so,
is
it
quite
certain
he
is
coming?"
"You
may
depend
on
it,"
replied
the
other,
"for
Mrs.
Nicholls
was
in
Meryton
last
night;
I
saw
her
passing
by,
and
went
out
myself
on
purpose
to
know
the
truth
of
it;
and
she
told
me
that
it
was
certain
true.
He
comes
down
on
Thursday
at
the
latest,
very
likely
on
Wednesday.
She
was
going
to
the
butcher's,
she
told
me,
on
purpose
to
order
in
some
meat
on
Wednesday,
and
she
has
got
three
couple
of
ducks
just
fit
to
be
killed."
Miss
Bennet
had
not
been
able
to
hear
of
his
coming
without
changing
colour.
It
was
many
months
since
she
had
mentioned
his
name
to
Elizabeth;
but
now,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together,
she
said:
"I
saw
you
look
at
me
to
day,
Lizzy,
when
my
aunt
told
us
of
the
present
report;
and
I
know
I
appeared
distressed.
But
don't
imagine
it
was
from
any
silly
cause.
I
was
only
confused
for
the
moment,
because
I
felt
that
I
should
be
looked
at.
I
do
assure
you
that
the
news
does
not
affect
me
either
with
pleasure
or
pain.
I
am
glad
of
one
thing,
that
he
comes
alone;
because
we
shall
see
the
less
of
him.
Not
that
I
am
afraid
of
myself,
but
I
dread
other
people's
remarks."
Elizabeth
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it.
Had
she
not
seen
him
in
Derbyshire,
she
might
have
supposed
him
capable
of
coming
there
with
no
other
view
than
what
was
acknowledged;
but
she
still
thought
him
partial
to
Jane,
and
she
wavered
as
to
the
greater
probability
of
his
coming
there
with
his
friend's
permission,
or
being
bold
enough
to
come
without
it.
"Yet
it
is
hard,"
she
sometimes
thought,
"that
this
poor
man
cannot
come
to
a
house
which
he
has
legally
hired,
without
raising
all
this
speculation!
I
will
leave
him
to
himself."
In
spite
of
what
her
sister
declared,
and
really
believed
to
be
her
feelings
in
the
expectation
of
his
arrival,
Elizabeth
could
easily
perceive
that
her
spirits
were
affected
by
it.
They
were
more
disturbed,
more
unequal,
than
she
had
often
seen
them.
The
subject
which
had
been
so
warmly
canvassed
between
their
parents,
about
a
twelvemonth
ago,
was
now
brought
forward
again.
"As
soon
as
ever
Mr.
Bingley
comes,
my
dear,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet,
"you
will
wait
on
him
of
course."
"No,
no.
You
forced
me
into
visiting
him
last
year,
and
promised,
if
I
went
to
see
him,
he
should
marry
one
of
my
daughters.
But
it
ended
in
nothing,
and
I
will
not
be
sent
on
a
fool's
errand
again."
His
wife
represented
to
him
how
absolutely
necessary
such
an
attention
would
be
from
all
the
neighbouring
gentlemen,
on
his
returning
to
Netherfield.
