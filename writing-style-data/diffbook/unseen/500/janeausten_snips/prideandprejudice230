upon
Maria;
and
as
Elizabeth
saw
no
occasion
for
making
it
a
general
concern,
when
Kitty
left
them
she
went
boldly
on
with
him
alone.
Now
was
the
moment
for
her
resolution
to
be
executed,
and,
while
her
courage
was
high,
she
immediately
said:
"Mr.
Darcy,
I
am
a
very
selfish
creature;
and,
for
the
sake
of
giving
relief
to
my
own
feelings,
care
not
how
much
I
may
be
wounding
yours.
I
can
no
longer
help
thanking
you
for
your
unexampled
kindness
to
my
poor
sister.
Ever
since
I
have
known
it,
I
have
been
most
anxious
to
acknowledge
to
you
how
gratefully
I
feel
it.
Were
it
known
to
the
rest
of
my
family,
I
should
not
have
merely
my
own
gratitude
to
express."
"I
am
sorry,
exceedingly
sorry,"
replied
Darcy,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
emotion,
"that
you
have
ever
been
informed
of
what
may,
in
a
mistaken
light,
have
given
you
uneasiness.
I
did
not
think
Mrs.
Gardiner
was
so
little
to
be
trusted."
"You
must
not
blame
my
aunt.
Lydia's
thoughtlessness
first
betrayed
to
me
that
you
had
been
concerned
in
the
matter;
and,
of
course,
I
could
not
rest
till
I
knew
the
particulars.
Let
me
thank
you
again
and
again,
in
the
name
of
all
my
family,
for
that
generous
compassion
which
induced
you
to
take
so
much
trouble,
and
bear
so
many
mortifications,
for
the
sake
of
discovering
them."
"If
you
will
thank
me,"
he
replied,
"let
it
be
for
yourself
alone.
That
the
wish
of
giving
happiness
to
you
might
add
force
to
the
other
inducements
which
led
me
on,
I
shall
not
attempt
to
deny.
But
your
family
owe
me
nothing.
Much
as
I
respect
them,
I
believe
I
thought
only
of
you."
Elizabeth
was
too
much
embarrassed
to
say
a
word.
After
a
short
pause,
her
companion
added,
"You
are
too
generous
to
trifle
with
me.
If
your
feelings
are
still
what
they
were
last
April,
tell
me
so
at
once.
My
affections
and
wishes
are
unchanged,
but
one
word
from
you
will
silence
me
on
this
subject
for
ever."
Elizabeth,
feeling
all
the
more
than
common
awkwardness
and
anxiety
of
his
situation,
now
forced
herself
to
speak;
and
immediately,
though
not
very
fluently,
gave
him
to
understand
that
her
sentiments
had
undergone
so
material
a
change,
since
the
period
to
which
he
alluded,
as
to
make
her
receive
with
gratitude
and
pleasure
his
present
assurances.
The
happiness
which
this
reply
produced,
was
such
as
he
had
probably
never
felt
before;
and
he
expressed
himself
on
the
occasion
as
sensibly
and
as
warmly
as
a
man
violently
in
love
can
be
supposed
to
do.
Had
Elizabeth
been
able
to
encounter
his
eye,
she
might
have
seen
how
well
the
expression
of
heartfelt
delight,
diffused
over
his
face,
became
him;
but,
though
she
could
not
look,
she
could
listen,
and
he
told
her
of
feelings,
which,
in
proving
of
what
importance
she
was
to
him,
made
his
affection
every
