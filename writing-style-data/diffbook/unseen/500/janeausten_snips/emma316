to
see
her
in
the
course
of
this
day."
"I
am
perfectly
satisfied,"
replied
Emma,
with
the
brightest
smiles,
"and
most
sincerely
wish
them
happy."
"You
are
materially
changed
since
we
talked
on
this
subject
before."
"I
hope
so
for
at
that
time
I
was
a
fool."
"And
I
am
changed
also;
for
I
am
now
very
willing
to
grant
you
all
Harriet's
good
qualities.
I
have
taken
some
pains
for
your
sake,
and
for
Robert
Martin's
sake,
(whom
I
have
always
had
reason
to
believe
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
ever,)
to
get
acquainted
with
her.
I
have
often
talked
to
her
a
good
deal.
You
must
have
seen
that
I
did.
Sometimes,
indeed,
I
have
thought
you
were
half
suspecting
me
of
pleading
poor
Martin's
cause,
which
was
never
the
case;
but,
from
all
my
observations,
I
am
convinced
of
her
being
an
artless,
amiable
girl,
with
very
good
notions,
very
seriously
good
principles,
and
placing
her
happiness
in
the
affections
and
utility
of
domestic
life.
Much
of
this,
I
have
no
doubt,
she
may
thank
you
for."
"Me!"
cried
Emma,
shaking
her
head.
"Ah!
poor
Harriet!"
She
checked
herself,
however,
and
submitted
quietly
to
a
little
more
praise
than
she
deserved.
Their
conversation
was
soon
afterwards
closed
by
the
entrance
of
her
father.
She
was
not
sorry.
She
wanted
to
be
alone.
Her
mind
was
in
a
state
of
flutter
and
wonder,
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
be
collected.
She
was
in
dancing,
singing,
exclaiming
spirits;
and
till
she
had
moved
about,
and
talked
to
herself,
and
laughed
and
reflected,
she
could
be
fit
for
nothing
rational.
Her
father's
business
was
to
announce
James's
being
gone
out
to
put
the
horses
to,
preparatory
to
their
now
daily
drive
to
Randalls;
and
she
had,
therefore,
an
immediate
excuse
for
disappearing.
The
joy,
the
gratitude,
the
exquisite
delight
of
her
sensations
may
be
imagined.
The
sole
grievance
and
alloy
thus
removed
in
the
prospect
of
Harriet's
welfare,
she
was
really
in
danger
of
becoming
too
happy
for
security.
What
had
she
to
wish
for?
Nothing,
but
to
grow
more
worthy
of
him,
whose
intentions
and
judgment
had
been
ever
so
superior
to
her
own.
Nothing,
but
that
the
lessons
of
her
past
folly
might
teach
her
humility
and
circumspection
in
future.
Serious
she
was,
very
serious
in
her
thankfulness,
and
in
her
resolutions;
and
yet
there
was
no
preventing
a
laugh,
sometimes
in
the
very
midst
of
them.
She
must
laugh
at
such
a
close!
Such
an
end
of
the
doleful
disappointment
of
five
weeks
back!
Such
a
heart
such
a
Harriet!
Now
there
would
be
pleasure
in
her
returning
Every
thing
would
be
a
pleasure.
It
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
know
Robert
Martin.
High
in
the
rank
of
her
most
serious
and
heartfelt
felicities,
was
the
reflection
that
all
necessity
of
concealment
from
Mr.
Knightley
would
soon
be
over.
The
disguise,
equivocation,
mystery,
so
hateful
to
her
to
practise,
might
soon
be
