where
she
felt
herself
to
be
right.
To
Mr.
Darcy
it
was
welcome
intelligence
Elizabeth
had
been
at
Netherfield
long
enough.
She
attracted
him
more
than
he
liked
and
Miss
Bingley
was
uncivil
to
her,
and
more
teasing
than
usual
to
himself.
He
wisely
resolved
to
be
particularly
careful
that
no
sign
of
admiration
should
now
escape
him,
nothing
that
could
elevate
her
with
the
hope
of
influencing
his
felicity;
sensible
that
if
such
an
idea
had
been
suggested,
his
behaviour
during
the
last
day
must
have
material
weight
in
confirming
or
crushing
it.
Steady
to
his
purpose,
he
scarcely
spoke
ten
words
to
her
through
the
whole
of
Saturday,
and
though
they
were
at
one
time
left
by
themselves
for
half
an
hour,
he
adhered
most
conscientiously
to
his
book,
and
would
not
even
look
at
her.
On
Sunday,
after
morning
service,
the
separation,
so
agreeable
to
almost
all,
took
place.
Miss
Bingley's
civility
to
Elizabeth
increased
at
last
very
rapidly,
as
well
as
her
affection
for
Jane;
and
when
they
parted,
after
assuring
the
latter
of
the
pleasure
it
would
always
give
her
to
see
her
either
at
Longbourn
or
Netherfield,
and
embracing
her
most
tenderly,
she
even
shook
hands
with
the
former.
Elizabeth
took
leave
of
the
whole
party
in
the
liveliest
of
spirits.
They
were
not
welcomed
home
very
cordially
by
their
mother.
Mrs.
Bennet
wondered
at
their
coming,
and
thought
them
very
wrong
to
give
so
much
trouble,
and
was
sure
Jane
would
have
caught
cold
again.
But
their
father,
though
very
laconic
in
his
expressions
of
pleasure,
was
really
glad
to
see
them;
he
had
felt
their
importance
in
the
family
circle.
The
evening
conversation,
when
they
were
all
assembled,
had
lost
much
of
its
animation,
and
almost
all
its
sense
by
the
absence
of
Jane
and
Elizabeth.
They
found
Mary,
as
usual,
deep
in
the
study
of
thorough
bass
and
human
nature;
and
had
some
extracts
to
admire,
and
some
new
observations
of
threadbare
morality
to
listen
to.
Catherine
and
Lydia
had
information
for
them
of
a
different
sort.
Much
had
been
done
and
much
had
been
said
in
the
regiment
since
the
preceding
Wednesday;
several
of
the
officers
had
dined
lately
with
their
uncle,
a
private
had
been
flogged,
and
it
had
actually
been
hinted
that
Colonel
Forster
was
going
to
be
married.
"I
hope,
my
dear,"
said
Mr.
Bennet
to
his
wife,
as
they
were
at
breakfast
the
next
morning,
"that
you
have
ordered
a
good
dinner
to
day,
because
I
have
reason
to
expect
an
addition
to
our
family
party."
"Who
do
you
mean,
my
dear?
I
know
of
nobody
that
is
coming,
I
am
sure,
unless
Charlotte
Lucas
should
happen
to
call
in
and
I
hope
my
dinners
are
good
enough
for
her.
I
do
not
believe
she
often
sees
such
at
home."
"The
person
of
whom
I
speak
is
a
gentleman,
and
a
stranger."
Mrs.
Bennet's
eyes
sparkled.
"A
gentleman
and
a
stranger!
It
is
Mr.
Bingley,
I
