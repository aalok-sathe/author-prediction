after
himself
and
Miss
Woodhouse
(for
his
neighbours
knew
that
he
loved
to
be
inquired
after),
as
well
as
Miss
Smith,
were
coming
in
during
the
rest
of
the
day;
and
he
had
the
pleasure
of
returning
for
answer,
that
they
were
all
very
indifferent
which,
though
not
exactly
true,
for
she
was
perfectly
well,
and
Harriet
not
much
otherwise,
Emma
would
not
interfere
with.
She
had
an
unhappy
state
of
health
in
general
for
the
child
of
such
a
man,
for
she
hardly
knew
what
indisposition
was;
and
if
he
did
not
invent
illnesses
for
her,
she
could
make
no
figure
in
a
message.
The
gipsies
did
not
wait
for
the
operations
of
justice;
they
took
themselves
off
in
a
hurry.
The
young
ladies
of
Highbury
might
have
walked
again
in
safety
before
their
panic
began,
and
the
whole
history
dwindled
soon
into
a
matter
of
little
importance
but
to
Emma
and
her
nephews:
in
her
imagination
it
maintained
its
ground,
and
Henry
and
John
were
still
asking
every
day
for
the
story
of
Harriet
and
the
gipsies,
and
still
tenaciously
setting
her
right
if
she
varied
in
the
slightest
particular
from
the
original
recital.
A
very
few
days
had
passed
after
this
adventure,
when
Harriet
came
one
morning
to
Emma
with
a
small
parcel
in
her
hand,
and
after
sitting
down
and
hesitating,
thus
began:
"Miss
Woodhouse
if
you
are
at
leisure
I
have
something
that
I
should
like
to
tell
you
a
sort
of
confession
to
make
and
then,
you
know,
it
will
be
over."
Emma
was
a
good
deal
surprized;
but
begged
her
to
speak.
There
was
a
seriousness
in
Harriet's
manner
which
prepared
her,
quite
as
much
as
her
words,
for
something
more
than
ordinary.
"It
is
my
duty,
and
I
am
sure
it
is
my
wish,"
she
continued,
"to
have
no
reserves
with
you
on
this
subject.
As
I
am
happily
quite
an
altered
creature
in
one
respect,
it
is
very
fit
that
you
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
it.
I
do
not
want
to
say
more
than
is
necessary
I
am
too
much
ashamed
of
having
given
way
as
I
have
done,
and
I
dare
say
you
understand
me."
"Yes,"
said
Emma,
"I
hope
I
do."
"How
I
could
so
long
a
time
be
fancying
myself!..."
cried
Harriet,
warmly.
"It
seems
like
madness!
I
can
see
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
him
now.
I
do
not
care
whether
I
meet
him
or
not
except
that
of
the
two
I
had
rather
not
see
him
and
indeed
I
would
go
any
distance
round
to
avoid
him
but
I
do
not
envy
his
wife
in
the
least;
I
neither
admire
her
nor
envy
her,
as
I
have
done:
she
is
very
charming,
I
dare
say,
and
all
that,
but
I
think
her
very
ill
tempered
and
disagreeable
I
shall
never
forget
her
look
the
other
night!
However,
I
assure
you,
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
wish
her
no
evil.
No,
let
them
be
ever
so
happy
