you
here
defend
yourself?
or
under
what
misrepresentation
can
you
here
impose
upon
others?"
"You
take
an
eager
interest
in
that
gentleman's
concerns,"
said
Darcy,
in
a
less
tranquil
tone,
and
with
a
heightened
colour.
"Who
that
knows
what
his
misfortunes
have
been,
can
help
feeling
an
interest
in
him?"
"His
misfortunes!"
repeated
Darcy
contemptuously;
"yes,
his
misfortunes
have
been
great
indeed."
"And
of
your
infliction,"
cried
Elizabeth
with
energy.
"You
have
reduced
him
to
his
present
state
of
poverty
comparative
poverty.
You
have
withheld
the
advantages
which
you
must
know
to
have
been
designed
for
him.
You
have
deprived
the
best
years
of
his
life
of
that
independence
which
was
no
less
his
due
than
his
desert.
You
have
done
all
this!
and
yet
you
can
treat
the
mention
of
his
misfortune
with
contempt
and
ridicule."
"And
this,"
cried
Darcy,
as
he
walked
with
quick
steps
across
the
room,
"is
your
opinion
of
me!
This
is
the
estimation
in
which
you
hold
me!
I
thank
you
for
explaining
it
so
fully.
My
faults,
according
to
this
calculation,
are
heavy
indeed!
But
perhaps,"
added
he,
stopping
in
his
walk,
and
turning
towards
her,
"these
offenses
might
have
been
overlooked,
had
not
your
pride
been
hurt
by
my
honest
confession
of
the
scruples
that
had
long
prevented
my
forming
any
serious
design.
These
bitter
accusations
might
have
been
suppressed,
had
I,
with
greater
policy,
concealed
my
struggles,
and
flattered
you
into
the
belief
of
my
being
impelled
by
unqualified,
unalloyed
inclination;
by
reason,
by
reflection,
by
everything.
But
disguise
of
every
sort
is
my
abhorrence.
Nor
am
I
ashamed
of
the
feelings
I
related.
They
were
natural
and
just.
Could
you
expect
me
to
rejoice
in
the
inferiority
of
your
connections?
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
hope
of
relations,
whose
condition
in
life
is
so
decidedly
beneath
my
own?"
Elizabeth
felt
herself
growing
more
angry
every
moment;
yet
she
tried
to
the
utmost
to
speak
with
composure
when
she
said:
"You
are
mistaken,
Mr.
Darcy,
if
you
suppose
that
the
mode
of
your
declaration
affected
me
in
any
other
way,
than
as
it
spared
me
the
concern
which
I
might
have
felt
in
refusing
you,
had
you
behaved
in
a
more
gentlemanlike
manner."
She
saw
him
start
at
this,
but
he
said
nothing,
and
she
continued:
"You
could
not
have
made
the
offer
of
your
hand
in
any
possible
way
that
would
have
tempted
me
to
accept
it."
Again
his
astonishment
was
obvious;
and
he
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
mingled
incredulity
and
mortification.
She
went
on:
"From
the
very
beginning
from
the
first
moment,
I
may
almost
say
of
my
acquaintance
with
you,
your
manners,
impressing
me
with
the
fullest
belief
of
your
arrogance,
your
conceit,
and
your
selfish
disdain
of
the
feelings
of
others,
were
such
as
to
form
the
groundwork
of
disapprobation
on
which
succeeding
events
have
built
so
immovable
a
dislike;
and
I
had
not
known
you
a
month
before
I
felt
that
you
