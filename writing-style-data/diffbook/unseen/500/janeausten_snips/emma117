you
know,
and
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do;
and
so
he
came
and
spoke,
and
I
answered
and
I
stood
for
a
minute,
feeling
dreadfully,
you
know,
one
can't
tell
how;
and
then
I
took
courage,
and
said
it
did
not
rain,
and
I
must
go;
and
so
off
I
set;
and
I
had
not
got
three
yards
from
the
door,
when
he
came
after
me,
only
to
say,
if
I
was
going
to
Hartfield,
he
thought
I
had
much
better
go
round
by
Mr.
Cole's
stables,
for
I
should
find
the
near
way
quite
floated
by
this
rain.
Oh!
dear,
I
thought
it
would
have
been
the
death
of
me!
So
I
said,
I
was
very
much
obliged
to
him:
you
know
I
could
not
do
less;
and
then
he
went
back
to
Elizabeth,
and
I
came
round
by
the
stables
I
believe
I
did
but
I
hardly
knew
where
I
was,
or
any
thing
about
it.
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
would
rather
done
any
thing
than
have
it
happen:
and
yet,
you
know,
there
was
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
seeing
him
behave
so
pleasantly
and
so
kindly.
And
Elizabeth,
too.
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
do
talk
to
me
and
make
me
comfortable
again."
Very
sincerely
did
Emma
wish
to
do
so;
but
it
was
not
immediately
in
her
power.
She
was
obliged
to
stop
and
think.
She
was
not
thoroughly
comfortable
herself.
The
young
man's
conduct,
and
his
sister's,
seemed
the
result
of
real
feeling,
and
she
could
not
but
pity
them.
As
Harriet
described
it,
there
had
been
an
interesting
mixture
of
wounded
affection
and
genuine
delicacy
in
their
behaviour.
But
she
had
believed
them
to
be
well
meaning,
worthy
people
before;
and
what
difference
did
this
make
in
the
evils
of
the
connexion?
It
was
folly
to
be
disturbed
by
it.
Of
course,
he
must
be
sorry
to
lose
her
they
must
be
all
sorry.
Ambition,
as
well
as
love,
had
probably
been
mortified.
They
might
all
have
hoped
to
rise
by
Harriet's
acquaintance:
and
besides,
what
was
the
value
of
Harriet's
description?
So
easily
pleased
so
little
discerning;
what
signified
her
praise?
She
exerted
herself,
and
did
try
to
make
her
comfortable,
by
considering
all
that
had
passed
as
a
mere
trifle,
and
quite
unworthy
of
being
dwelt
on,
"It
might
be
distressing,
for
the
moment,"
said
she;
"but
you
seem
to
have
behaved
extremely
well;
and
it
is
over
and
may
never
can
never,
as
a
first
meeting,
occur
again,
and
therefore
you
need
not
think
about
it."
Harriet
said,
"very
true,"
and
she
"would
not
think
about
it;"
but
still
she
talked
of
it
still
she
could
talk
of
nothing
else;
and
Emma,
at
last,
in
order
to
put
the
Martins
out
of
her
head,
was
obliged
to
hurry
on
the
news,
which
she
had
meant
to
give
with
so
much
tender
caution;
hardly
knowing
herself
whether
to
rejoice
or
be
angry,
ashamed
or
only
amused,
at
such
