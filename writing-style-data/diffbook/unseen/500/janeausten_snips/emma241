to
see
him.
Mrs.
Weston
would
be
at
ease.
The
black
mare
was
blameless;
they
were
right
who
had
named
Mrs.
Churchill
as
the
cause.
He
had
been
detained
by
a
temporary
increase
of
illness
in
her;
a
nervous
seizure,
which
had
lasted
some
hours
and
he
had
quite
given
up
every
thought
of
coming,
till
very
late;
and
had
he
known
how
hot
a
ride
he
should
have,
and
how
late,
with
all
his
hurry,
he
must
be,
he
believed
he
should
not
have
come
at
all.
The
heat
was
excessive;
he
had
never
suffered
any
thing
like
it
almost
wished
he
had
staid
at
home
nothing
killed
him
like
heat
he
could
bear
any
degree
of
cold,
etc.,
but
heat
was
intolerable
and
he
sat
down,
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
from
the
slight
remains
of
Mr.
Woodhouse's
fire,
looking
very
deplorable.
"You
will
soon
be
cooler,
if
you
sit
still,"
said
Emma.
"As
soon
as
I
am
cooler
I
shall
go
back
again.
I
could
very
ill
be
spared
but
such
a
point
had
been
made
of
my
coming!
You
will
all
be
going
soon
I
suppose;
the
whole
party
breaking
up.
I
met
one
as
I
came
Madness
in
such
weather!
absolute
madness!"
Emma
listened,
and
looked,
and
soon
perceived
that
Frank
Churchill's
state
might
be
best
defined
by
the
expressive
phrase
of
being
out
of
humour.
Some
people
were
always
cross
when
they
were
hot.
Such
might
be
his
constitution;
and
as
she
knew
that
eating
and
drinking
were
often
the
cure
of
such
incidental
complaints,
she
recommended
his
taking
some
refreshment;
he
would
find
abundance
of
every
thing
in
the
dining
room
and
she
humanely
pointed
out
the
door.
"No
he
should
not
eat.
He
was
not
hungry;
it
would
only
make
him
hotter."
In
two
minutes,
however,
he
relented
in
his
own
favour;
and
muttering
something
about
spruce
beer,
walked
off.
Emma
returned
all
her
attention
to
her
father,
saying
in
secret
"I
am
glad
I
have
done
being
in
love
with
him.
I
should
not
like
a
man
who
is
so
soon
discomposed
by
a
hot
morning.
Harriet's
sweet
easy
temper
will
not
mind
it."
He
was
gone
long
enough
to
have
had
a
very
comfortable
meal,
and
came
back
all
the
better
grown
quite
cool
and,
with
good
manners,
like
himself
able
to
draw
a
chair
close
to
them,
take
an
interest
in
their
employment;
and
regret,
in
a
reasonable
way,
that
he
should
be
so
late.
He
was
not
in
his
best
spirits,
but
seemed
trying
to
improve
them;
and,
at
last,
made
himself
talk
nonsense
very
agreeably.
They
were
looking
over
views
in
Swisserland.
"As
soon
as
my
aunt
gets
well,
I
shall
go
abroad,"
said
he.
"I
shall
never
be
easy
till
I
have
seen
some
of
these
places.
You
will
have
my
sketches,
some
time
or
other,
to
look
at
or
my
tour
to
read
or
my
poem.
I
shall
do
something
to
expose
myself."
"That
may
