so
quick,
from
the
accidental
rencontre,
to
the
dinner
at
Mr.
Green's,
and
the
party
at
Mrs.
Brown's
smiles
and
blushes
rising
in
importance
with
consciousness
and
agitation
richly
scattered
the
lady
had
been
so
easily
impressed
so
sweetly
disposed
had
in
short,
to
use
a
most
intelligible
phrase,
been
so
very
ready
to
have
him,
that
vanity
and
prudence
were
equally
contented.
He
had
caught
both
substance
and
shadow
both
fortune
and
affection,
and
was
just
the
happy
man
he
ought
to
be;
talking
only
of
himself
and
his
own
concerns
expecting
to
be
congratulated
ready
to
be
laughed
at
and,
with
cordial,
fearless
smiles,
now
addressing
all
the
young
ladies
of
the
place,
to
whom,
a
few
weeks
ago,
he
would
have
been
more
cautiously
gallant.
The
wedding
was
no
distant
event,
as
the
parties
had
only
themselves
to
please,
and
nothing
but
the
necessary
preparations
to
wait
for;
and
when
he
set
out
for
Bath
again,
there
was
a
general
expectation,
which
a
certain
glance
of
Mrs.
Cole's
did
not
seem
to
contradict,
that
when
he
next
entered
Highbury
he
would
bring
his
bride.
During
his
present
short
stay,
Emma
had
barely
seen
him;
but
just
enough
to
feel
that
the
first
meeting
was
over,
and
to
give
her
the
impression
of
his
not
being
improved
by
the
mixture
of
pique
and
pretension,
now
spread
over
his
air.
She
was,
in
fact,
beginning
very
much
to
wonder
that
she
had
ever
thought
him
pleasing
at
all;
and
his
sight
was
so
inseparably
connected
with
some
very
disagreeable
feelings,
that,
except
in
a
moral
light,
as
a
penance,
a
lesson,
a
source
of
profitable
humiliation
to
her
own
mind,
she
would
have
been
thankful
to
be
assured
of
never
seeing
him
again.
She
wished
him
very
well;
but
he
gave
her
pain,
and
his
welfare
twenty
miles
off
would
administer
most
satisfaction.
The
pain
of
his
continued
residence
in
Highbury,
however,
must
certainly
be
lessened
by
his
marriage.
Many
vain
solicitudes
would
be
prevented
many
awkwardnesses
smoothed
by
it.
A
Mrs.
Elton
would
be
an
excuse
for
any
change
of
intercourse;
former
intimacy
might
sink
without
remark.
It
would
be
almost
beginning
their
life
of
civility
again.
Of
the
lady,
individually,
Emma
thought
very
little.
She
was
good
enough
for
Mr.
Elton,
no
doubt;
accomplished
enough
for
Highbury
handsome
enough
to
look
plain,
probably,
by
Harriet's
side.
As
to
connexion,
there
Emma
was
perfectly
easy;
persuaded,
that
after
all
his
own
vaunted
claims
and
disdain
of
Harriet,
he
had
done
nothing.
On
that
article,
truth
seemed
attainable.
What
she
was,
must
be
uncertain;
but
who
she
was,
might
be
found
out;
and
setting
aside
the
10,000
l.,
it
did
not
appear
that
she
was
at
all
Harriet's
superior.
She
brought
no
name,
no
blood,
no
alliance.
Miss
Hawkins
was
the
youngest
of
the
two
daughters
of
a
Bristol
merchant,
of
course,
he
must
be
called;
but,
as
the
whole
of
the
profits
of
his
mercantile
life
appeared
so
