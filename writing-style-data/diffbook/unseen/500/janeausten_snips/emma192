enough
for
wishing.
She
was
delighted
with
the
fortitude
of
her
little
friend
for
fortitude
she
knew
it
was
in
her
to
give
up
being
in
company
and
stay
at
home;
and
she
could
now
invite
the
very
person
whom
she
really
wanted
to
make
the
eighth,
Jane
Fairfax.
Since
her
last
conversation
with
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mr.
Knightley,
she
was
more
conscience
stricken
about
Jane
Fairfax
than
she
had
often
been.
Mr.
Knightley's
words
dwelt
with
her.
He
had
said
that
Jane
Fairfax
received
attentions
from
Mrs.
Elton
which
nobody
else
paid
her.
"This
is
very
true,"
said
she,
"at
least
as
far
as
relates
to
me,
which
was
all
that
was
meant
and
it
is
very
shameful.
Of
the
same
age
and
always
knowing
her
I
ought
to
have
been
more
her
friend.
She
will
never
like
me
now.
I
have
neglected
her
too
long.
But
I
will
shew
her
greater
attention
than
I
have
done."
Every
invitation
was
successful.
They
were
all
disengaged
and
all
happy.
The
preparatory
interest
of
this
dinner,
however,
was
not
yet
over.
A
circumstance
rather
unlucky
occurred.
The
two
eldest
little
Knightleys
were
engaged
to
pay
their
grandpapa
and
aunt
a
visit
of
some
weeks
in
the
spring,
and
their
papa
now
proposed
bringing
them,
and
staying
one
whole
day
at
Hartfield
which
one
day
would
be
the
very
day
of
this
party.
His
professional
engagements
did
not
allow
of
his
being
put
off,
but
both
father
and
daughter
were
disturbed
by
its
happening
so.
Mr.
Woodhouse
considered
eight
persons
at
dinner
together
as
the
utmost
that
his
nerves
could
bear
and
here
would
be
a
ninth
and
Emma
apprehended
that
it
would
be
a
ninth
very
much
out
of
humour
at
not
being
able
to
come
even
to
Hartfield
for
forty
eight
hours
without
falling
in
with
a
dinner
party.
She
comforted
her
father
better
than
she
could
comfort
herself,
by
representing
that
though
he
certainly
would
make
them
nine,
yet
he
always
said
so
little,
that
the
increase
of
noise
would
be
very
immaterial.
She
thought
it
in
reality
a
sad
exchange
for
herself,
to
have
him
with
his
grave
looks
and
reluctant
conversation
opposed
to
her
instead
of
his
brother.
The
event
was
more
favourable
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
than
to
Emma.
John
Knightley
came;
but
Mr.
Weston
was
unexpectedly
summoned
to
town
and
must
be
absent
on
the
very
day.
He
might
be
able
to
join
them
in
the
evening,
but
certainly
not
to
dinner.
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
quite
at
ease;
and
the
seeing
him
so,
with
the
arrival
of
the
little
boys
and
the
philosophic
composure
of
her
brother
on
hearing
his
fate,
removed
the
chief
of
even
Emma's
vexation.
The
day
came,
the
party
were
punctually
assembled,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
seemed
early
to
devote
himself
to
the
business
of
being
agreeable.
Instead
of
drawing
his
brother
off
to
a
window
while
they
waited
for
dinner,
he
was
talking
to
Miss
Fairfax.
Mrs.
Elton,
as
elegant
as
