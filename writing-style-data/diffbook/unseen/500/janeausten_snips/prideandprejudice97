the
only
ones
worth
knowing,
after
all."
"Take
care,
Lizzy;
that
speech
savours
strongly
of
disappointment."
Before
they
were
separated
by
the
conclusion
of
the
play,
she
had
the
unexpected
happiness
of
an
invitation
to
accompany
her
uncle
and
aunt
in
a
tour
of
pleasure
which
they
proposed
taking
in
the
summer.
"We
have
not
determined
how
far
it
shall
carry
us,"
said
Mrs.
Gardiner,
"but,
perhaps,
to
the
Lakes."
No
scheme
could
have
been
more
agreeable
to
Elizabeth,
and
her
acceptance
of
the
invitation
was
most
ready
and
grateful.
"Oh,
my
dear,
dear
aunt,"
she
rapturously
cried,
"what
delight!
what
felicity!
You
give
me
fresh
life
and
vigour.
Adieu
to
disappointment
and
spleen.
What
are
young
men
to
rocks
and
mountains?
Oh!
what
hours
of
transport
we
shall
spend!
And
when
we
do
return,
it
shall
not
be
like
other
travellers,
without
being
able
to
give
one
accurate
idea
of
anything.
We
will
know
where
we
have
gone
we
will
recollect
what
we
have
seen.
Lakes,
mountains,
and
rivers
shall
not
be
jumbled
together
in
our
imaginations;
nor
when
we
attempt
to
describe
any
particular
scene,
will
we
begin
quarreling
about
its
relative
situation.
Let
our
first
effusions
be
less
insupportable
than
those
of
the
generality
of
travellers."
Every
object
in
the
next
day's
journey
was
new
and
interesting
to
Elizabeth;
and
her
spirits
were
in
a
state
of
enjoyment;
for
she
had
seen
her
sister
looking
so
well
as
to
banish
all
fear
for
her
health,
and
the
prospect
of
her
northern
tour
was
a
constant
source
of
delight.
When
they
left
the
high
road
for
the
lane
to
Hunsford,
every
eye
was
in
search
of
the
Parsonage,
and
every
turning
expected
to
bring
it
in
view.
The
palings
of
Rosings
Park
was
their
boundary
on
one
side.
Elizabeth
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
all
that
she
had
heard
of
its
inhabitants.
At
length
the
Parsonage
was
discernible.
The
garden
sloping
to
the
road,
the
house
standing
in
it,
the
green
pales,
and
the
laurel
hedge,
everything
declared
they
were
arriving.
Mr.
Collins
and
Charlotte
appeared
at
the
door,
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
small
gate
which
led
by
a
short
gravel
walk
to
the
house,
amidst
the
nods
and
smiles
of
the
whole
party.
In
a
moment
they
were
all
out
of
the
chaise,
rejoicing
at
the
sight
of
each
other.
Mrs.
Collins
welcomed
her
friend
with
the
liveliest
pleasure,
and
Elizabeth
was
more
and
more
satisfied
with
coming
when
she
found
herself
so
affectionately
received.
She
saw
instantly
that
her
cousin's
manners
were
not
altered
by
his
marriage;
his
formal
civility
was
just
what
it
had
been,
and
he
detained
her
some
minutes
at
the
gate
to
hear
and
satisfy
his
inquiries
after
all
her
family.
They
were
then,
with
no
other
delay
than
his
pointing
out
the
neatness
of
the
entrance,
taken
into
the
house;
and
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
parlour,
he
welcomed
them
a
second
time,
with
ostentatious
formality
to
