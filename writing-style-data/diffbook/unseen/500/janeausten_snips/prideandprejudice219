Bennet
could
not
give
her
consent
or
speak
her
approbation
in
terms
warm
enough
to
satisfy
her
feelings,
though
she
talked
to
Bingley
of
nothing
else
for
half
an
hour;
and
when
Mr.
Bennet
joined
them
at
supper,
his
voice
and
manner
plainly
showed
how
really
happy
he
was.
Not
a
word,
however,
passed
his
lips
in
allusion
to
it,
till
their
visitor
took
his
leave
for
the
night;
but
as
soon
as
he
was
gone,
he
turned
to
his
daughter,
and
said:
"Jane,
I
congratulate
you.
You
will
be
a
very
happy
woman."
Jane
went
to
him
instantly,
kissed
him,
and
thanked
him
for
his
goodness.
"You
are
a
good
girl;"
he
replied,
"and
I
have
great
pleasure
in
thinking
you
will
be
so
happily
settled.
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
your
doing
very
well
together.
Your
tempers
are
by
no
means
unlike.
You
are
each
of
you
so
complying,
that
nothing
will
ever
be
resolved
on;
so
easy,
that
every
servant
will
cheat
you;
and
so
generous,
that
you
will
always
exceed
your
income."
"I
hope
not
so.
Imprudence
or
thoughtlessness
in
money
matters
would
be
unpardonable
in
me."
"Exceed
their
income!
My
dear
Mr.
Bennet,"
cried
his
wife,
"what
are
you
talking
of?
Why,
he
has
four
or
five
thousand
a
year,
and
very
likely
more."
Then
addressing
her
daughter,
"Oh!
my
dear,
dear
Jane,
I
am
so
happy!
I
am
sure
I
shan't
get
a
wink
of
sleep
all
night.
I
knew
how
it
would
be.
I
always
said
it
must
be
so,
at
last.
I
was
sure
you
could
not
be
so
beautiful
for
nothing!
I
remember,
as
soon
as
ever
I
saw
him,
when
he
first
came
into
Hertfordshire
last
year,
I
thought
how
likely
it
was
that
you
should
come
together.
Oh!
he
is
the
handsomest
young
man
that
ever
was
seen!"
Wickham,
Lydia,
were
all
forgotten.
Jane
was
beyond
competition
her
favourite
child.
At
that
moment,
she
cared
for
no
other.
Her
younger
sisters
soon
began
to
make
interest
with
her
for
objects
of
happiness
which
she
might
in
future
be
able
to
dispense.
Mary
petitioned
for
the
use
of
the
library
at
Netherfield;
and
Kitty
begged
very
hard
for
a
few
balls
there
every
winter.
Bingley,
from
this
time,
was
of
course
a
daily
visitor
at
Longbourn;
coming
frequently
before
breakfast,
and
always
remaining
till
after
supper;
unless
when
some
barbarous
neighbour,
who
could
not
be
enough
detested,
had
given
him
an
invitation
to
dinner
which
he
thought
himself
obliged
to
accept.
Elizabeth
had
now
but
little
time
for
conversation
with
her
sister;
for
while
he
was
present,
Jane
had
no
attention
to
bestow
on
anyone
else;
but
she
found
herself
considerably
useful
to
both
of
them
in
those
hours
of
separation
that
must
sometimes
occur.
In
the
absence
of
Jane,
he
always
attached
himself
to
Elizabeth,
for
the
pleasure
of
talking
of
her;
and
when
Bingley
was
gone,
Jane
constantly
sought
the
same
means
of
relief.
"He
has
