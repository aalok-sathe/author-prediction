Edward
street,
and
has
since
maintained
herself
by
letting
lodgings.
This
Mrs.
Younge
was,
he
knew,
intimately
acquainted
with
Wickham;
and
he
went
to
her
for
intelligence
of
him
as
soon
as
he
got
to
town.
But
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
he
could
get
from
her
what
he
wanted.
She
would
not
betray
her
trust,
I
suppose,
without
bribery
and
corruption,
for
she
really
did
know
where
her
friend
was
to
be
found.
Wickham
indeed
had
gone
to
her
on
their
first
arrival
in
London,
and
had
she
been
able
to
receive
them
into
her
house,
they
would
have
taken
up
their
abode
with
her.
At
length,
however,
our
kind
friend
procured
the
wished
for
direction.
They
were
in
street.
He
saw
Wickham,
and
afterwards
insisted
on
seeing
Lydia.
His
first
object
with
her,
he
acknowledged,
had
been
to
persuade
her
to
quit
her
present
disgraceful
situation,
and
return
to
her
friends
as
soon
as
they
could
be
prevailed
on
to
receive
her,
offering
his
assistance,
as
far
as
it
would
go.
But
he
found
Lydia
absolutely
resolved
on
remaining
where
she
was.
She
cared
for
none
of
her
friends;
she
wanted
no
help
of
his;
she
would
not
hear
of
leaving
Wickham.
She
was
sure
they
should
be
married
some
time
or
other,
and
it
did
not
much
signify
when.
Since
such
were
her
feelings,
it
only
remained,
he
thought,
to
secure
and
expedite
a
marriage,
which,
in
his
very
first
conversation
with
Wickham,
he
easily
learnt
had
never
been
his
design.
He
confessed
himself
obliged
to
leave
the
regiment,
on
account
of
some
debts
of
honour,
which
were
very
pressing;
and
scrupled
not
to
lay
all
the
ill
consequences
of
Lydia's
flight
on
her
own
folly
alone.
He
meant
to
resign
his
commission
immediately;
and
as
to
his
future
situation,
he
could
conjecture
very
little
about
it.
He
must
go
somewhere,
but
he
did
not
know
where,
and
he
knew
he
should
have
nothing
to
live
on.
"Mr.
Darcy
asked
him
why
he
had
not
married
your
sister
at
once.
Though
Mr.
Bennet
was
not
imagined
to
be
very
rich,
he
would
have
been
able
to
do
something
for
him,
and
his
situation
must
have
been
benefited
by
marriage.
But
he
found,
in
reply
to
this
question,
that
Wickham
still
cherished
the
hope
of
more
effectually
making
his
fortune
by
marriage
in
some
other
country.
Under
such
circumstances,
however,
he
was
not
likely
to
be
proof
against
the
temptation
of
immediate
relief.
"They
met
several
times,
for
there
was
much
to
be
discussed.
Wickham
of
course
wanted
more
than
he
could
get;
but
at
length
was
reduced
to
be
reasonable.
"Every
thing
being
settled
between
them,
Mr.
Darcy's
next
step
was
to
make
your
uncle
acquainted
with
it,
and
he
first
called
in
Gracechurch
street
the
evening
before
I
came
home.
But
Mr.
Gardiner
could
not
be
seen,
and
Mr.
Darcy
found,
on
further
inquiry,
that
your
father
was
still
with
him,
but
would
quit
