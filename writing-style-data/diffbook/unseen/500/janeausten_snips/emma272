had
received
from
him,
a
look,
a
speech,
a
removal
from
one
chair
to
another,
a
compliment
implied,
a
preference
inferred,
had
been
unnoticed,
because
unsuspected,
by
Emma.
Circumstances
that
might
swell
to
half
an
hour's
relation,
and
contained
multiplied
proofs
to
her
who
had
seen
them,
had
passed
undiscerned
by
her
who
now
heard
them;
but
the
two
latest
occurrences
to
be
mentioned,
the
two
of
strongest
promise
to
Harriet,
were
not
without
some
degree
of
witness
from
Emma
herself.
The
first,
was
his
walking
with
her
apart
from
the
others,
in
the
lime
walk
at
Donwell,
where
they
had
been
walking
some
time
before
Emma
came,
and
he
had
taken
pains
(as
she
was
convinced)
to
draw
her
from
the
rest
to
himself
and
at
first,
he
had
talked
to
her
in
a
more
particular
way
than
he
had
ever
done
before,
in
a
very
particular
way
indeed!
(Harriet
could
not
recall
it
without
a
blush.)
He
seemed
to
be
almost
asking
her,
whether
her
affections
were
engaged.
But
as
soon
as
she
(Miss
Woodhouse)
appeared
likely
to
join
them,
he
changed
the
subject,
and
began
talking
about
farming:
The
second,
was
his
having
sat
talking
with
her
nearly
half
an
hour
before
Emma
came
back
from
her
visit,
the
very
last
morning
of
his
being
at
Hartfield
though,
when
he
first
came
in,
he
had
said
that
he
could
not
stay
five
minutes
and
his
having
told
her,
during
their
conversation,
that
though
he
must
go
to
London,
it
was
very
much
against
his
inclination
that
he
left
home
at
all,
which
was
much
more
(as
Emma
felt)
than
he
had
acknowledged
to
her.
The
superior
degree
of
confidence
towards
Harriet,
which
this
one
article
marked,
gave
her
severe
pain.
On
the
subject
of
the
first
of
the
two
circumstances,
she
did,
after
a
little
reflection,
venture
the
following
question.
"Might
he
not?
Is
not
it
possible,
that
when
enquiring,
as
you
thought,
into
the
state
of
your
affections,
he
might
be
alluding
to
Mr.
Martin
he
might
have
Mr.
Martin's
interest
in
view?
But
Harriet
rejected
the
suspicion
with
spirit.
"Mr.
Martin!
No
indeed!
There
was
not
a
hint
of
Mr.
Martin.
I
hope
I
know
better
now,
than
to
care
for
Mr.
Martin,
or
to
be
suspected
of
it."
When
Harriet
had
closed
her
evidence,
she
appealed
to
her
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
to
say
whether
she
had
not
good
ground
for
hope.
"I
never
should
have
presumed
to
think
of
it
at
first,"
said
she,
"but
for
you.
You
told
me
to
observe
him
carefully,
and
let
his
behaviour
be
the
rule
of
mine
and
so
I
have.
But
now
I
seem
to
feel
that
I
may
deserve
him;
and
that
if
he
does
chuse
me,
it
will
not
be
any
thing
so
very
wonderful."
The
bitter
feelings
occasioned
by
this
speech,
the
many
bitter
feelings,
made
the
utmost
exertion
necessary
on
Emma's
side,
to
enable
her
to
say
on
reply,
"Harriet,
I
will
only
