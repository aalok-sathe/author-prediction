accompaniment
to
her
song
took
her
agreeably
by
surprize
a
second,
slightly
but
correctly
taken
by
Frank
Churchill.
Her
pardon
was
duly
begged
at
the
close
of
the
song,
and
every
thing
usual
followed.
He
was
accused
of
having
a
delightful
voice,
and
a
perfect
knowledge
of
music;
which
was
properly
denied;
and
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
matter,
and
had
no
voice
at
all,
roundly
asserted.
They
sang
together
once
more;
and
Emma
would
then
resign
her
place
to
Miss
Fairfax,
whose
performance,
both
vocal
and
instrumental,
she
never
could
attempt
to
conceal
from
herself,
was
infinitely
superior
to
her
own.
With
mixed
feelings,
she
seated
herself
at
a
little
distance
from
the
numbers
round
the
instrument,
to
listen.
Frank
Churchill
sang
again.
They
had
sung
together
once
or
twice,
it
appeared,
at
Weymouth.
But
the
sight
of
Mr.
Knightley
among
the
most
attentive,
soon
drew
away
half
Emma's
mind;
and
she
fell
into
a
train
of
thinking
on
the
subject
of
Mrs.
Weston's
suspicions,
to
which
the
sweet
sounds
of
the
united
voices
gave
only
momentary
interruptions.
Her
objections
to
Mr.
Knightley's
marrying
did
not
in
the
least
subside.
She
could
see
nothing
but
evil
in
it.
It
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
Mr.
John
Knightley;
consequently
to
Isabella.
A
real
injury
to
the
children
a
most
mortifying
change,
and
material
loss
to
them
all;
a
very
great
deduction
from
her
father's
daily
comfort
and,
as
to
herself,
she
could
not
at
all
endure
the
idea
of
Jane
Fairfax
at
Donwell
Abbey.
A
Mrs.
Knightley
for
them
all
to
give
way
to!
No
Mr.
Knightley
must
never
marry.
Little
Henry
must
remain
the
heir
of
Donwell.
Presently
Mr.
Knightley
looked
back,
and
came
and
sat
down
by
her.
They
talked
at
first
only
of
the
performance.
His
admiration
was
certainly
very
warm;
yet
she
thought,
but
for
Mrs.
Weston,
it
would
not
have
struck
her.
As
a
sort
of
touchstone,
however,
she
began
to
speak
of
his
kindness
in
conveying
the
aunt
and
niece;
and
though
his
answer
was
in
the
spirit
of
cutting
the
matter
short,
she
believed
it
to
indicate
only
his
disinclination
to
dwell
on
any
kindness
of
his
own.
"I
often
feel
concern,"
said
she,
"that
I
dare
not
make
our
carriage
more
useful
on
such
occasions.
It
is
not
that
I
am
without
the
wish;
but
you
know
how
impossible
my
father
would
deem
it
that
James
should
put
to
for
such
a
purpose."
"Quite
out
of
the
question,
quite
out
of
the
question,"
he
replied;
"but
you
must
often
wish
it,
I
am
sure."
And
he
smiled
with
such
seeming
pleasure
at
the
conviction,
that
she
must
proceed
another
step.
"This
present
from
the
Campbells,"
said
she
"this
pianoforte
is
very
kindly
given."
"Yes,"
he
replied,
and
without
the
smallest
apparent
embarrassment.
"But
they
would
have
done
better
had
they
given
her
notice
of
it.
Surprizes
are
foolish
things.
The
pleasure
is
not
enhanced,
and
the
inconvenience
is
often
considerable.
