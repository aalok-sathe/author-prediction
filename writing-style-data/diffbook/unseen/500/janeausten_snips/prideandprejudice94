was
now
absolutely
over.
She
would
not
even
wish
for
a
renewal
of
his
attentions.
His
character
sunk
on
every
review
of
it;
and
as
a
punishment
for
him,
as
well
as
a
possible
advantage
to
Jane,
she
seriously
hoped
he
might
really
soon
marry
Mr.
Darcy's
sister,
as
by
Wickham's
account,
she
would
make
him
abundantly
regret
what
he
had
thrown
away.
Mrs.
Gardiner
about
this
time
reminded
Elizabeth
of
her
promise
concerning
that
gentleman,
and
required
information;
and
Elizabeth
had
such
to
send
as
might
rather
give
contentment
to
her
aunt
than
to
herself.
His
apparent
partiality
had
subsided,
his
attentions
were
over,
he
was
the
admirer
of
some
one
else.
Elizabeth
was
watchful
enough
to
see
it
all,
but
she
could
see
it
and
write
of
it
without
material
pain.
Her
heart
had
been
but
slightly
touched,
and
her
vanity
was
satisfied
with
believing
that
she
would
have
been
his
only
choice,
had
fortune
permitted
it.
The
sudden
acquisition
of
ten
thousand
pounds
was
the
most
remarkable
charm
of
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
was
now
rendering
himself
agreeable;
but
Elizabeth,
less
clear
sighted
perhaps
in
this
case
than
in
Charlotte's,
did
not
quarrel
with
him
for
his
wish
of
independence.
Nothing,
on
the
contrary,
could
be
more
natural;
and
while
able
to
suppose
that
it
cost
him
a
few
struggles
to
relinquish
her,
she
was
ready
to
allow
it
a
wise
and
desirable
measure
for
both,
and
could
very
sincerely
wish
him
happy.
All
this
was
acknowledged
to
Mrs.
Gardiner;
and
after
relating
the
circumstances,
she
thus
went
on:
"I
am
now
convinced,
my
dear
aunt,
that
I
have
never
been
much
in
love;
for
had
I
really
experienced
that
pure
and
elevating
passion,
I
should
at
present
detest
his
very
name,
and
wish
him
all
manner
of
evil.
But
my
feelings
are
not
only
cordial
towards
him;
they
are
even
impartial
towards
Miss
King.
I
cannot
find
out
that
I
hate
her
at
all,
or
that
I
am
in
the
least
unwilling
to
think
her
a
very
good
sort
of
girl.
There
can
be
no
love
in
all
this.
My
watchfulness
has
been
effectual;
and
though
I
certainly
should
be
a
more
interesting
object
to
all
my
acquaintances
were
I
distractedly
in
love
with
him,
I
cannot
say
that
I
regret
my
comparative
insignificance.
Importance
may
sometimes
be
purchased
too
dearly.
Kitty
and
Lydia
take
his
defection
much
more
to
heart
than
I
do.
They
are
young
in
the
ways
of
the
world,
and
not
yet
open
to
the
mortifying
conviction
that
handsome
young
men
must
have
something
to
live
on
as
well
as
the
plain."
With
no
greater
events
than
these
in
the
Longbourn
family,
and
otherwise
diversified
by
little
beyond
the
walks
to
Meryton,
sometimes
dirty
and
sometimes
cold,
did
January
and
February
pass
away.
March
was
to
take
Elizabeth
to
Hunsford.
She
had
not
at
first
thought
very
seriously
of
going
thither;
but
Charlotte,
she
soon
found,
was
depending
on
the
