very
different.
I
must
think
your
statement
by
no
means
fair.
You
are
not
just
to
Harriet's
claims.
They
would
be
estimated
very
differently
by
others
as
well
as
myself;
Mr.
Martin
may
be
the
richest
of
the
two,
but
he
is
undoubtedly
her
inferior
as
to
rank
in
society.
The
sphere
in
which
she
moves
is
much
above
his.
It
would
be
a
degradation."
"A
degradation
to
illegitimacy
and
ignorance,
to
be
married
to
a
respectable,
intelligent
gentleman
farmer!"
"As
to
the
circumstances
of
her
birth,
though
in
a
legal
sense
she
may
be
called
Nobody,
it
will
not
hold
in
common
sense.
She
is
not
to
pay
for
the
offence
of
others,
by
being
held
below
the
level
of
those
with
whom
she
is
brought
up.
There
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
that
her
father
is
a
gentleman
and
a
gentleman
of
fortune.
Her
allowance
is
very
liberal;
nothing
has
ever
been
grudged
for
her
improvement
or
comfort.
That
she
is
a
gentleman's
daughter,
is
indubitable
to
me;
that
she
associates
with
gentlemen's
daughters,
no
one,
I
apprehend,
will
deny.
She
is
superior
to
Mr.
Robert
Martin."
"Whoever
might
be
her
parents,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
"whoever
may
have
had
the
charge
of
her,
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
part
of
their
plan
to
introduce
her
into
what
you
would
call
good
society.
After
receiving
a
very
indifferent
education
she
is
left
in
Mrs.
Goddard's
hands
to
shift
as
she
can;
to
move,
in
short,
in
Mrs.
Goddard's
line,
to
have
Mrs.
Goddard's
acquaintance.
Her
friends
evidently
thought
this
good
enough
for
her;
and
it
was
good
enough.
She
desired
nothing
better
herself.
Till
you
chose
to
turn
her
into
a
friend,
her
mind
had
no
distaste
for
her
own
set,
nor
any
ambition
beyond
it.
She
was
as
happy
as
possible
with
the
Martins
in
the
summer.
She
had
no
sense
of
superiority
then.
If
she
has
it
now,
you
have
given
it.
You
have
been
no
friend
to
Harriet
Smith,
Emma.
Robert
Martin
would
never
have
proceeded
so
far,
if
he
had
not
felt
persuaded
of
her
not
being
disinclined
to
him.
I
know
him
well.
He
has
too
much
real
feeling
to
address
any
woman
on
the
haphazard
of
selfish
passion.
And
as
to
conceit,
he
is
the
farthest
from
it
of
any
man
I
know.
Depend
upon
it
he
had
encouragement."
It
was
most
convenient
to
Emma
not
to
make
a
direct
reply
to
this
assertion;
she
chose
rather
to
take
up
her
own
line
of
the
subject
again.
"You
are
a
very
warm
friend
to
Mr.
Martin;
but,
as
I
said
before,
are
unjust
to
Harriet.
Harriet's
claims
to
marry
well
are
not
so
contemptible
as
you
represent
them.
She
is
not
a
clever
girl,
but
she
has
better
sense
than
you
are
aware
of,
and
does
not
deserve
to
have
her
understanding
spoken
of
so
slightingly.
Waiving
that
point,
however,
and
supposing
her
to
be,
as
you
describe
her,
only
