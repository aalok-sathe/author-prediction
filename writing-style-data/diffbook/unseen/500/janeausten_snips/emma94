in
love
than
Emma
had
foreseen;
but
yet
it
appeared
to
her
so
natural,
so
inevitable
to
strive
against
an
inclination
of
that
sort
unrequited,
that
she
could
not
comprehend
its
continuing
very
long
in
equal
force.
If
Mr.
Elton,
on
his
return,
made
his
own
indifference
as
evident
and
indubitable
as
she
could
not
doubt
he
would
anxiously
do,
she
could
not
imagine
Harriet's
persisting
to
place
her
happiness
in
the
sight
or
the
recollection
of
him.
Their
being
fixed,
so
absolutely
fixed,
in
the
same
place,
was
bad
for
each,
for
all
three.
Not
one
of
them
had
the
power
of
removal,
or
of
effecting
any
material
change
of
society.
They
must
encounter
each
other,
and
make
the
best
of
it.
Harriet
was
farther
unfortunate
in
the
tone
of
her
companions
at
Mrs.
Goddard's;
Mr.
Elton
being
the
adoration
of
all
the
teachers
and
great
girls
in
the
school;
and
it
must
be
at
Hartfield
only
that
she
could
have
any
chance
of
hearing
him
spoken
of
with
cooling
moderation
or
repellent
truth.
Where
the
wound
had
been
given,
there
must
the
cure
be
found
if
anywhere;
and
Emma
felt
that,
till
she
saw
her
in
the
way
of
cure,
there
could
be
no
true
peace
for
herself.
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
did
not
come.
When
the
time
proposed
drew
near,
Mrs.
Weston's
fears
were
justified
in
the
arrival
of
a
letter
of
excuse.
For
the
present,
he
could
not
be
spared,
to
his
"very
great
mortification
and
regret;
but
still
he
looked
forward
with
the
hope
of
coming
to
Randalls
at
no
distant
period."
Mrs.
Weston
was
exceedingly
disappointed
much
more
disappointed,
in
fact,
than
her
husband,
though
her
dependence
on
seeing
the
young
man
had
been
so
much
more
sober:
but
a
sanguine
temper,
though
for
ever
expecting
more
good
than
occurs,
does
not
always
pay
for
its
hopes
by
any
proportionate
depression.
It
soon
flies
over
the
present
failure,
and
begins
to
hope
again.
For
half
an
hour
Mr.
Weston
was
surprized
and
sorry;
but
then
he
began
to
perceive
that
Frank's
coming
two
or
three
months
later
would
be
a
much
better
plan;
better
time
of
year;
better
weather;
and
that
he
would
be
able,
without
any
doubt,
to
stay
considerably
longer
with
them
than
if
he
had
come
sooner.
These
feelings
rapidly
restored
his
comfort,
while
Mrs.
Weston,
of
a
more
apprehensive
disposition,
foresaw
nothing
but
a
repetition
of
excuses
and
delays;
and
after
all
her
concern
for
what
her
husband
was
to
suffer,
suffered
a
great
deal
more
herself.
Emma
was
not
at
this
time
in
a
state
of
spirits
to
care
really
about
Mr.
Frank
Churchill's
not
coming,
except
as
a
disappointment
at
Randalls.
The
acquaintance
at
present
had
no
charm
for
her.
She
wanted,
rather,
to
be
quiet,
and
out
of
temptation;
but
still,
as
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
appear,
in
general,
like
her
usual
self,
she
took
care
to
express
as
much
interest
in
the
circumstance,
and
