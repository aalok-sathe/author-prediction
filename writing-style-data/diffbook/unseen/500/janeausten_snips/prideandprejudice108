him
at
Rosings;
and
Mrs.
Collins's
pretty
friend
had
moreover
caught
his
fancy
very
much.
He
now
seated
himself
by
her,
and
talked
so
agreeably
of
Kent
and
Hertfordshire,
of
travelling
and
staying
at
home,
of
new
books
and
music,
that
Elizabeth
had
never
been
half
so
well
entertained
in
that
room
before;
and
they
conversed
with
so
much
spirit
and
flow,
as
to
draw
the
attention
of
Lady
Catherine
herself,
as
well
as
of
Mr.
Darcy.
His
eyes
had
been
soon
and
repeatedly
turned
towards
them
with
a
look
of
curiosity;
and
that
her
ladyship,
after
a
while,
shared
the
feeling,
was
more
openly
acknowledged,
for
she
did
not
scruple
to
call
out:
"What
is
that
you
are
saying,
Fitzwilliam?
What
is
it
you
are
talking
of?
What
are
you
telling
Miss
Bennet?
Let
me
hear
what
it
is."
"We
are
speaking
of
music,
madam,"
said
he,
when
no
longer
able
to
avoid
a
reply.
"Of
music!
Then
pray
speak
aloud.
It
is
of
all
subjects
my
delight.
I
must
have
my
share
in
the
conversation
if
you
are
speaking
of
music.
There
are
few
people
in
England,
I
suppose,
who
have
more
true
enjoyment
of
music
than
myself,
or
a
better
natural
taste.
If
I
had
ever
learnt,
I
should
have
been
a
great
proficient.
And
so
would
Anne,
if
her
health
had
allowed
her
to
apply.
I
am
confident
that
she
would
have
performed
delightfully.
How
does
Georgiana
get
on,
Darcy?"
Mr.
Darcy
spoke
with
affectionate
praise
of
his
sister's
proficiency.
"I
am
very
glad
to
hear
such
a
good
account
of
her,"
said
Lady
Catherine;
"and
pray
tell
her
from
me,
that
she
cannot
expect
to
excel
if
she
does
not
practice
a
good
deal."
"I
assure
you,
madam,"
he
replied,
"that
she
does
not
need
such
advice.
She
practises
very
constantly."
"So
much
the
better.
It
cannot
be
done
too
much;
and
when
I
next
write
to
her,
I
shall
charge
her
not
to
neglect
it
on
any
account.
I
often
tell
young
ladies
that
no
excellence
in
music
is
to
be
acquired
without
constant
practice.
I
have
told
Miss
Bennet
several
times,
that
she
will
never
play
really
well
unless
she
practises
more;
and
though
Mrs.
Collins
has
no
instrument,
she
is
very
welcome,
as
I
have
often
told
her,
to
come
to
Rosings
every
day,
and
play
on
the
pianoforte
in
Mrs.
Jenkinson's
room.
She
would
be
in
nobody's
way,
you
know,
in
that
part
of
the
house."
Mr.
Darcy
looked
a
little
ashamed
of
his
aunt's
ill
breeding,
and
made
no
answer.
When
coffee
was
over,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
reminded
Elizabeth
of
having
promised
to
play
to
him;
and
she
sat
down
directly
to
the
instrument.
He
drew
a
chair
near
her.
Lady
Catherine
listened
to
half
a
song,
and
then
talked,
as
before,
to
her
other
nephew;
till
the
latter
walked
away
from
her,
and
making
with
his
usual
deliberation
towards
the
pianoforte
stationed
himself
so
as
to
command
a
full
view
