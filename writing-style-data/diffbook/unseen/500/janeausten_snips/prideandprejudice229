were
married.
It
was
an
encouragement
of
vice;
and
had
I
been
the
rector
of
Longbourn,
I
should
very
strenuously
have
opposed
it.
You
ought
certainly
to
forgive
them,
as
a
Christian,
but
never
to
admit
them
in
your
sight,
or
allow
their
names
to
be
mentioned
in
your
hearing.'
That
is
his
notion
of
Christian
forgiveness!
The
rest
of
his
letter
is
only
about
his
dear
Charlotte's
situation,
and
his
expectation
of
a
young
olive
branch.
But,
Lizzy,
you
look
as
if
you
did
not
enjoy
it.
You
are
not
going
to
be
missish,
I
hope,
and
pretend
to
be
affronted
at
an
idle
report.
For
what
do
we
live,
but
to
make
sport
for
our
neighbours,
and
laugh
at
them
in
our
turn?"
"Oh!"
cried
Elizabeth,
"I
am
excessively
diverted.
But
it
is
so
strange!"
"Yes
that
is
what
makes
it
amusing.
Had
they
fixed
on
any
other
man
it
would
have
been
nothing;
but
his
perfect
indifference,
and
your
pointed
dislike,
make
it
so
delightfully
absurd!
Much
as
I
abominate
writing,
I
would
not
give
up
Mr.
Collins's
correspondence
for
any
consideration.
Nay,
when
I
read
a
letter
of
his,
I
cannot
help
giving
him
the
preference
even
over
Wickham,
much
as
I
value
the
impudence
and
hypocrisy
of
my
son
in
law.
And
pray,
Lizzy,
what
said
Lady
Catherine
about
this
report?
Did
she
call
to
refuse
her
consent?"
To
this
question
his
daughter
replied
only
with
a
laugh;
and
as
it
had
been
asked
without
the
least
suspicion,
she
was
not
distressed
by
his
repeating
it.
Elizabeth
had
never
been
more
at
a
loss
to
make
her
feelings
appear
what
they
were
not.
It
was
necessary
to
laugh,
when
she
would
rather
have
cried.
Her
father
had
most
cruelly
mortified
her,
by
what
he
said
of
Mr.
Darcy's
indifference,
and
she
could
do
nothing
but
wonder
at
such
a
want
of
penetration,
or
fear
that
perhaps,
instead
of
his
seeing
too
little,
she
might
have
fancied
too
much.
Instead
of
receiving
any
such
letter
of
excuse
from
his
friend,
as
Elizabeth
half
expected
Mr.
Bingley
to
do,
he
was
able
to
bring
Darcy
with
him
to
Longbourn
before
many
days
had
passed
after
Lady
Catherine's
visit.
The
gentlemen
arrived
early;
and,
before
Mrs.
Bennet
had
time
to
tell
him
of
their
having
seen
his
aunt,
of
which
her
daughter
sat
in
momentary
dread,
Bingley,
who
wanted
to
be
alone
with
Jane,
proposed
their
all
walking
out.
It
was
agreed
to.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
not
in
the
habit
of
walking;
Mary
could
never
spare
time;
but
the
remaining
five
set
off
together.
Bingley
and
Jane,
however,
soon
allowed
the
others
to
outstrip
them.
They
lagged
behind,
while
Elizabeth,
Kitty,
and
Darcy
were
to
entertain
each
other.
Very
little
was
said
by
either;
Kitty
was
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
talk;
Elizabeth
was
secretly
forming
a
desperate
resolution;
and
perhaps
he
might
be
doing
the
same.
They
walked
towards
the
Lucases,
because
Kitty
wished
to
call
