more
than
civil;
it
was
really
attentive;
and
there
was
no
necessity
for
such
attention.
His
acquaintance
with
Elizabeth
was
very
trifling."
"To
be
sure,
Lizzy,"
said
her
aunt,
"he
is
not
so
handsome
as
Wickham;
or,
rather,
he
has
not
Wickham's
countenance,
for
his
features
are
perfectly
good.
But
how
came
you
to
tell
me
that
he
was
so
disagreeable?"
Elizabeth
excused
herself
as
well
as
she
could;
said
that
she
had
liked
him
better
when
they
had
met
in
Kent
than
before,
and
that
she
had
never
seen
him
so
pleasant
as
this
morning.
"But
perhaps
he
may
be
a
little
whimsical
in
his
civilities,"
replied
her
uncle.
"Your
great
men
often
are;
and
therefore
I
shall
not
take
him
at
his
word,
as
he
might
change
his
mind
another
day,
and
warn
me
off
his
grounds."
Elizabeth
felt
that
they
had
entirely
misunderstood
his
character,
but
said
nothing.
"From
what
we
have
seen
of
him,"
continued
Mrs.
Gardiner,
"I
really
should
not
have
thought
that
he
could
have
behaved
in
so
cruel
a
way
by
anybody
as
he
has
done
by
poor
Wickham.
He
has
not
an
ill
natured
look.
On
the
contrary,
there
is
something
pleasing
about
his
mouth
when
he
speaks.
And
there
is
something
of
dignity
in
his
countenance
that
would
not
give
one
an
unfavourable
idea
of
his
heart.
But,
to
be
sure,
the
good
lady
who
showed
us
his
house
did
give
him
a
most
flaming
character!
I
could
hardly
help
laughing
aloud
sometimes.
But
he
is
a
liberal
master,
I
suppose,
and
that
in
the
eye
of
a
servant
comprehends
every
virtue."
Elizabeth
here
felt
herself
called
on
to
say
something
in
vindication
of
his
behaviour
to
Wickham;
and
therefore
gave
them
to
understand,
in
as
guarded
a
manner
as
she
could,
that
by
what
she
had
heard
from
his
relations
in
Kent,
his
actions
were
capable
of
a
very
different
construction;
and
that
his
character
was
by
no
means
so
faulty,
nor
Wickham's
so
amiable,
as
they
had
been
considered
in
Hertfordshire.
In
confirmation
of
this,
she
related
the
particulars
of
all
the
pecuniary
transactions
in
which
they
had
been
connected,
without
actually
naming
her
authority,
but
stating
it
to
be
such
as
might
be
relied
on.
Mrs.
Gardiner
was
surprised
and
concerned;
but
as
they
were
now
approaching
the
scene
of
her
former
pleasures,
every
idea
gave
way
to
the
charm
of
recollection;
and
she
was
too
much
engaged
in
pointing
out
to
her
husband
all
the
interesting
spots
in
its
environs
to
think
of
anything
else.
Fatigued
as
she
had
been
by
the
morning's
walk
they
had
no
sooner
dined
than
she
set
off
again
in
quest
of
her
former
acquaintance,
and
the
evening
was
spent
in
the
satisfactions
of
a
intercourse
renewed
after
many
years'
discontinuance.
The
occurrences
of
the
day
were
too
full
of
interest
to
leave
Elizabeth
much
attention
for
any
of
these
new
friends;
and
she
could
do
nothing
but
think,
and
think
with
