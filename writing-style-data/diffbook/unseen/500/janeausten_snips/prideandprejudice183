as
this,
one
cannot
see
too
little
of
one's
neighbours.
Assistance
is
impossible;
condolence
insufferable.
Let
them
triumph
over
us
at
a
distance,
and
be
satisfied."
She
then
proceeded
to
inquire
into
the
measures
which
her
father
had
intended
to
pursue,
while
in
town,
for
the
recovery
of
his
daughter.
"He
meant
I
believe,"
replied
Jane,
"to
go
to
Epsom,
the
place
where
they
last
changed
horses,
see
the
postilions
and
try
if
anything
could
be
made
out
from
them.
His
principal
object
must
be
to
discover
the
number
of
the
hackney
coach
which
took
them
from
Clapham.
It
had
come
with
a
fare
from
London;
and
as
he
thought
that
the
circumstance
of
a
gentleman
and
lady's
removing
from
one
carriage
into
another
might
be
remarked
he
meant
to
make
inquiries
at
Clapham.
If
he
could
anyhow
discover
at
what
house
the
coachman
had
before
set
down
his
fare,
he
determined
to
make
inquiries
there,
and
hoped
it
might
not
be
impossible
to
find
out
the
stand
and
number
of
the
coach.
I
do
not
know
of
any
other
designs
that
he
had
formed;
but
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
gone,
and
his
spirits
so
greatly
discomposed,
that
I
had
difficulty
in
finding
out
even
so
much
as
this."
The
whole
party
were
in
hopes
of
a
letter
from
Mr.
Bennet
the
next
morning,
but
the
post
came
in
without
bringing
a
single
line
from
him.
His
family
knew
him
to
be,
on
all
common
occasions,
a
most
negligent
and
dilatory
correspondent;
but
at
such
a
time
they
had
hoped
for
exertion.
They
were
forced
to
conclude
that
he
had
no
pleasing
intelligence
to
send;
but
even
of
that
they
would
have
been
glad
to
be
certain.
Mr.
Gardiner
had
waited
only
for
the
letters
before
he
set
off.
When
he
was
gone,
they
were
certain
at
least
of
receiving
constant
information
of
what
was
going
on,
and
their
uncle
promised,
at
parting,
to
prevail
on
Mr.
Bennet
to
return
to
Longbourn,
as
soon
as
he
could,
to
the
great
consolation
of
his
sister,
who
considered
it
as
the
only
security
for
her
husband's
not
being
killed
in
a
duel.
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
the
children
were
to
remain
in
Hertfordshire
a
few
days
longer,
as
the
former
thought
her
presence
might
be
serviceable
to
her
nieces.
She
shared
in
their
attendance
on
Mrs.
Bennet,
and
was
a
great
comfort
to
them
in
their
hours
of
freedom.
Their
other
aunt
also
visited
them
frequently,
and
always,
as
she
said,
with
the
design
of
cheering
and
heartening
them
up
though,
as
she
never
came
without
reporting
some
fresh
instance
of
Wickham's
extravagance
or
irregularity,
she
seldom
went
away
without
leaving
them
more
dispirited
than
she
found
them.
All
Meryton
seemed
striving
to
blacken
the
man
who,
but
three
months
before,
had
been
almost
an
angel
of
light.
He
was
declared
to
be
in
debt
to
every
tradesman
in
the
place,
and
his
intrigues,
all
honoured
with
the
title
