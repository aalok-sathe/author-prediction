William
Goulding
in
his
curricle,
so
I
was
determined
he
should
know
it,
and
so
I
let
down
the
side
glass
next
to
him,
and
took
off
my
glove,
and
let
my
hand
just
rest
upon
the
window
frame,
so
that
he
might
see
the
ring,
and
then
I
bowed
and
smiled
like
anything."
Elizabeth
could
bear
it
no
longer.
She
got
up,
and
ran
out
of
the
room;
and
returned
no
more,
till
she
heard
them
passing
through
the
hall
to
the
dining
parlour.
She
then
joined
them
soon
enough
to
see
Lydia,
with
anxious
parade,
walk
up
to
her
mother's
right
hand,
and
hear
her
say
to
her
eldest
sister,
"Ah!
Jane,
I
take
your
place
now,
and
you
must
go
lower,
because
I
am
a
married
woman."
It
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
time
would
give
Lydia
that
embarrassment
from
which
she
had
been
so
wholly
free
at
first.
Her
ease
and
good
spirits
increased.
She
longed
to
see
Mrs.
Phillips,
the
Lucases,
and
all
their
other
neighbours,
and
to
hear
herself
called
"Mrs.
Wickham"
by
each
of
them;
and
in
the
mean
time,
she
went
after
dinner
to
show
her
ring,
and
boast
of
being
married,
to
Mrs.
Hill
and
the
two
housemaids.
"Well,
mamma,"
said
she,
when
they
were
all
returned
to
the
breakfast
room,
"and
what
do
you
think
of
my
husband?
Is
not
he
a
charming
man?
I
am
sure
my
sisters
must
all
envy
me.
I
only
hope
they
may
have
half
my
good
luck.
They
must
all
go
to
Brighton.
That
is
the
place
to
get
husbands.
What
a
pity
it
is,
mamma,
we
did
not
all
go."
"Very
true;
and
if
I
had
my
will,
we
should.
But
my
dear
Lydia,
I
don't
at
all
like
your
going
such
a
way
off.
Must
it
be
so?"
"Oh,
lord!
yes;
there
is
nothing
in
that.
I
shall
like
it
of
all
things.
You
and
papa,
and
my
sisters,
must
come
down
and
see
us.
We
shall
be
at
Newcastle
all
the
winter,
and
I
dare
say
there
will
be
some
balls,
and
I
will
take
care
to
get
good
partners
for
them
all."
"I
should
like
it
beyond
anything!"
said
her
mother.
"And
then
when
you
go
away,
you
may
leave
one
or
two
of
my
sisters
behind
you;
and
I
dare
say
I
shall
get
husbands
for
them
before
the
winter
is
over."
"I
thank
you
for
my
share
of
the
favour,"
said
Elizabeth;
"but
I
do
not
particularly
like
your
way
of
getting
husbands."
Their
visitors
were
not
to
remain
above
ten
days
with
them.
Mr.
Wickham
had
received
his
commission
before
he
left
London,
and
he
was
to
join
his
regiment
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight.
No
one
but
Mrs.
Bennet
regretted
that
their
stay
would
be
so
short;
and
she
made
the
most
of
the
time
by
visiting
about
with
her
daughter,
and
having
very
frequent
parties
at
home.
These
parties
were
acceptable
to
all;
