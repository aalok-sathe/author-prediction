over.
She
could
now
look
forward
to
giving
him
that
full
and
perfect
confidence
which
her
disposition
was
most
ready
to
welcome
as
a
duty.
In
the
gayest
and
happiest
spirits
she
set
forward
with
her
father;
not
always
listening,
but
always
agreeing
to
what
he
said;
and,
whether
in
speech
or
silence,
conniving
at
the
comfortable
persuasion
of
his
being
obliged
to
go
to
Randalls
every
day,
or
poor
Mrs.
Weston
would
be
disappointed.
They
arrived.
Mrs.
Weston
was
alone
in
the
drawing
room:
but
hardly
had
they
been
told
of
the
baby,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
received
the
thanks
for
coming,
which
he
asked
for,
when
a
glimpse
was
caught
through
the
blind,
of
two
figures
passing
near
the
window.
"It
is
Frank
and
Miss
Fairfax,"
said
Mrs.
Weston.
"I
was
just
going
to
tell
you
of
our
agreeable
surprize
in
seeing
him
arrive
this
morning.
He
stays
till
to
morrow,
and
Miss
Fairfax
has
been
persuaded
to
spend
the
day
with
us.
They
are
coming
in,
I
hope."
In
half
a
minute
they
were
in
the
room.
Emma
was
extremely
glad
to
see
him
but
there
was
a
degree
of
confusion
a
number
of
embarrassing
recollections
on
each
side.
They
met
readily
and
smiling,
but
with
a
consciousness
which
at
first
allowed
little
to
be
said;
and
having
all
sat
down
again,
there
was
for
some
time
such
a
blank
in
the
circle,
that
Emma
began
to
doubt
whether
the
wish
now
indulged,
which
she
had
long
felt,
of
seeing
Frank
Churchill
once
more,
and
of
seeing
him
with
Jane,
would
yield
its
proportion
of
pleasure.
When
Mr.
Weston
joined
the
party,
however,
and
when
the
baby
was
fetched,
there
was
no
longer
a
want
of
subject
or
animation
or
of
courage
and
opportunity
for
Frank
Churchill
to
draw
near
her
and
say,
"I
have
to
thank
you,
Miss
Woodhouse,
for
a
very
kind
forgiving
message
in
one
of
Mrs.
Weston's
letters.
I
hope
time
has
not
made
you
less
willing
to
pardon.
I
hope
you
do
not
retract
what
you
then
said."
"No,
indeed,"
cried
Emma,
most
happy
to
begin,
"not
in
the
least.
I
am
particularly
glad
to
see
and
shake
hands
with
you
and
to
give
you
joy
in
person."
He
thanked
her
with
all
his
heart,
and
continued
some
time
to
speak
with
serious
feeling
of
his
gratitude
and
happiness.
"Is
not
she
looking
well?"
said
he,
turning
his
eyes
towards
Jane.
"Better
than
she
ever
used
to
do?
You
see
how
my
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
doat
upon
her."
But
his
spirits
were
soon
rising
again,
and
with
laughing
eyes,
after
mentioning
the
expected
return
of
the
Campbells,
he
named
the
name
of
Dixon.
Emma
blushed,
and
forbade
its
being
pronounced
in
her
hearing.
"I
can
never
think
of
it,"
she
cried,
"without
extreme
shame."
"The
shame,"
he
answered,
"is
all
mine,
or
ought
to
be.
But
is
it
possible
that
you
had
no
suspicion?
I
mean
of
late.
Early,
I
know,
you
