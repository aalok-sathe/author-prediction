the
buffeting,
she
was
still
the
conqueror
of
Nature
and
the
mistress
of
the
sky.
There
is
surely
something
divine
in
man
himself
that
he
should
rise
so
superior
to
the
limitations
which
Creation
seemed
to
impose
rise,
too,
by
such
unselfish,
heroic
devotion
as
this
air
conquest
has
shown.
Talk
of
human
degeneration!
When
has
such
a
story
as
this
been
written
in
the
annals
of
our
race?
"These
were
the
thoughts
in
my
head
as
I
climbed
that
monstrous,
inclined
plane
with
the
wind
sometimes
beating
in
my
face
and
sometimes
whistling
behind
my
ears,
while
the
cloud
land
beneath
me
fell
away
to
such
a
distance
that
the
folds
and
hummocks
of
silver
had
all
smoothed
out
into
one
flat,
shining
plain.
But
suddenly
I
had
a
horrible
and
unprecedented
experience.
I
have
known
before
what
it
is
to
be
in
what
our
neighbours
have
called
a
tourbillon,
but
never
on
such
a
scale
as
this.
That
huge,
sweeping
river
of
wind
of
which
I
have
spoken
had,
as
it
appears,
whirlpools
within
it
which
were
as
monstrous
as
itself.
Without
a
moment's
warning
I
was
dragged
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
one.
I
spun
round
for
a
minute
or
two
with
such
velocity
that
I
almost
lost
my
senses,
and
then
fell
suddenly,
left
wing
foremost,
down
the
vacuum
funnel
in
the
centre.
I
dropped
like
a
stone,
and
lost
nearly
a
thousand
feet.
It
was
only
my
belt
that
kept
me
in
my
seat,
and
the
shock
and
breathlessness
left
me
hanging
half
insensible
over
the
side
of
the
fuselage.
But
I
am
always
capable
of
a
supreme
effort
it
is
my
one
great
merit
as
an
aviator.
I
was
conscious
that
the
descent
was
slower.
The
whirlpool
was
a
cone
rather
than
a
funnel,
and
I
had
come
to
the
apex.
With
a
terrific
wrench,
throwing
my
weight
all
to
one
side,
I
levelled
my
planes
and
brought
her
head
away
from
the
wind.
In
an
instant
I
had
shot
out
of
the
eddies
and
was
skimming
down
the
sky.
Then,
shaken
but
victorious,
I
turned
her
nose
up
and
began
once
more
my
steady
grind
on
the
upward
spiral.
I
took
a
large
sweep
to
avoid
the
danger
spot
of
the
whirlpool,
and
soon
I
was
safely
above
it.
Just
after
one
o'clock
I
was
twenty
one
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
level.
To
my
great
joy
I
had
topped
the
gale,
and
with
every
hundred
feet
of
ascent
the
air
grew
stiller.
On
the
other
hand,
it
was
very
cold,
and
I
was
conscious
of
that
peculiar
nausea
which
goes
with
rarefaction
of
the
air.
For
the
first
time
I
unscrewed
the
mouth
of
my
oxygen
bag
and
took
an
occasional
whiff
of
the
glorious
gas.
I
could
feel
it
running
like
a
cordial
through
my
veins,
and
I
was
exhilarated
almost
to
the
point
of
drunkenness.
I
shouted
and
sang
as
I
soared
upwards
into
the
cold,
still
outer
world.
