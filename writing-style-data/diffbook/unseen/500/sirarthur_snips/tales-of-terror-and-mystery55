Johnsons
and
the
like,
may
smile
at
my
narrative,
but
the
poorer
folk
of
the
countryside
had
never
a
doubt
as
to
its
truth.
On
the
day
after
my
recovering
consciousness
they
assembled
in
their
hundreds
round
the
Blue
John
Gap.
As
the
Castleton
Courier
said:
"It
was
useless
for
our
correspondent,
or
for
any
of
the
adventurous
gentlemen
who
had
come
from
Matlock,
Buxton,
and
other
parts,
to
offer
to
descend,
to
explore
the
cave
to
the
end,
and
to
finally
test
the
extraordinary
narrative
of
Dr.
James
Hardcastle.
The
country
people
had
taken
the
matter
into
their
own
hands,
and
from
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
they
had
worked
hard
in
stopping
up
the
entrance
of
the
tunnel.
There
is
a
sharp
slope
where
the
shaft
begins,
and
great
boulders,
rolled
along
by
many
willing
hands,
were
thrust
down
it
until
the
Gap
was
absolutely
sealed.
So
ends
the
episode
which
has
caused
such
excitement
throughout
the
country.
Local
opinion
is
fiercely
divided
upon
the
subject.
On
the
one
hand
are
those
who
point
to
Dr.
Hardcastle's
impaired
health,
and
to
the
possibility
of
cerebral
lesions
of
tubercular
origin
giving
rise
to
strange
hallucinations.
Some
idee
fixe,
according
to
these
gentlemen,
caused
the
doctor
to
wander
down
the
tunnel,
and
a
fall
among
the
rocks
was
sufficient
to
account
for
his
injuries.
On
the
other
hand,
a
legend
of
a
strange
creature
in
the
Gap
has
existed
for
some
months
back,
and
the
farmers
look
upon
Dr.
Hardcastle's
narrative
and
his
personal
injuries
as
a
final
corroboration.
So
the
matter
stands,
and
so
the
matter
will
continue
to
stand,
for
no
definite
solution
seems
to
us
to
be
now
possible.
It
transcends
human
wit
to
give
any
scientific
explanation
which
could
cover
the
alleged
facts."
Perhaps
before
the
Courier
published
these
words
they
would
have
been
wise
to
send
their
representative
to
me.
I
have
thought
the
matter
out,
as
no
one
else
has
occasion
to
do,
and
it
is
possible
that
I
might
have
removed
some
of
the
more
obvious
difficulties
of
the
narrative
and
brought
it
one
degree
nearer
to
scientific
acceptance.
Let
me
then
write
down
the
only
explanation
which
seems
to
me
to
elucidate
what
I
know
to
my
cost
to
have
been
a
series
of
facts.
My
theory
may
seem
to
be
wildly
improbable,
but
at
least
no
one
can
venture
to
say
that
it
is
impossible.
My
view
is
and
it
was
formed,
as
is
shown
by
my
diary,
before
my
personal
adventure
that
in
this
part
of
England
there
is
a
vast
subterranean
lake
or
sea,
which
is
fed
by
the
great
number
of
streams
which
pass
down
through
the
limestone.
Where
there
is
a
large
collection
of
water
there
must
also
be
some
evaporation,
mists
or
rain,
and
a
possibility
of
vegetation.
This
in
turn
suggests
that
there
may
be
animal
life,
arising,
as
the
vegetable
life
would
also
do,
from
those
seeds
and
types
which
had
been
introduced
