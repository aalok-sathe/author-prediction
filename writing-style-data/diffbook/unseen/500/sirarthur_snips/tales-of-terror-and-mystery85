spared.
It
would
have
been
very
agreeable
if
we
could
have
done
so,
but
business
is
business.
Besides,
the
train
was
now
as
much
beyond
our
controls
as
theirs.
"He
ceased
howling
when
the
train
rattled
round
the
curve
and
they
saw
the
black
mouth
of
the
mine
yawning
before
them.
We
had
removed
the
boards
which
had
covered
it,
and
we
had
cleared
the
square
entrance.
The
rails
had
formerly
run
very
close
to
the
shaft
for
the
convenience
of
loading
the
coal,
and
we
had
only
to
add
two
or
three
lengths
of
rail
in
order
to
lead
to
the
very
brink
of
the
shaft.
In
fact,
as
the
lengths
would
not
quite
fit,
our
line
projected
about
three
feet
over
the
edge.
We
saw
the
two
heads
at
the
window:
Caratal
below,
Gomez
above;
but
they
had
both
been
struck
silent
by
what
they
saw.
And
yet
they
could
not
withdraw
their
heads.
The
sight
seemed
to
have
paralysed
them.
"I
had
wondered
how
the
train
running
at
a
great
speed
would
take
the
pit
into
which
I
had
guided
it,
and
I
was
much
interested
in
watching
it.
One
of
my
colleagues
thought
that
it
would
actually
jump
it,
and
indeed
it
was
not
very
far
from
doing
so.
Fortunately,
however,
it
fell
short,
and
the
buffers
of
the
engine
struck
the
other
lip
of
the
shaft
with
a
tremendous
crash.
The
funnel
flew
off
into
the
air.
The
tender,
carriages,
and
van
were
all
smashed
up
into
one
jumble,
which,
with
the
remains
of
the
engine,
choked
for
a
minute
or
so
the
mouth
of
the
pit.
Then
something
gave
way
in
the
middle,
and
the
whole
mass
of
green
iron,
smoking
coals,
brass
fittings,
wheels,
wood
work,
and
cushions
all
crumbled
together
and
crashed
down
into
the
mine.
We
heard
the
rattle,
rattle,
rattle,
as
the
debris
struck
against
the
walls,
and
then,
quite
a
long
time
afterwards,
there
came
a
deep
roar
as
the
remains
of
the
train
struck
the
bottom.
The
boiler
may
have
burst,
for
a
sharp
crash
came
after
the
roar,
and
then
a
dense
cloud
of
steam
and
smoke
swirled
up
out
of
the
black
depths,
falling
in
a
spray
as
thick
as
rain
all
round
us.
Then
the
vapour
shredded
off
into
thin
wisps,
which
floated
away
in
the
summer
sunshine,
and
all
was
quiet
again
in
the
Heartsease
mine.
"And
now,
having
carried
out
our
plans
so
successfully,
it
only
remained
to
leave
no
trace
behind
us.
Our
little
band
of
workers
at
the
other
end
had
already
ripped
up
the
rails
and
disconnected
the
side
line,
replacing
everything
as
it
had
been
before.
We
were
equally
busy
at
the
mine.
The
funnel
and
other
fragments
were
thrown
in,
the
shaft
was
planked
over
as
it
used
to
be,
and
the
lines
which
led
to
it
were
torn
up
and
taken
away.
Then,
without
flurry,
but
without
delay,
we
all
made
our
way
out
of
the
country,
