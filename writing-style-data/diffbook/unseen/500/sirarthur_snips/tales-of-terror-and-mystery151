with
mystical
characters.
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
they
were
the
jewels
of
the
urim
and
thummim.
"'Good
God!'
I
cried.
'How
have
you
escaped
discovery?'
"'By
the
substitution
of
twelve
others,
made
especially
to
my
order,
in
which
the
originals
are
so
carefully
imitated
that
I
defy
the
eye
to
detect
the
difference.'
"'Then
the
present
stones
are
false?'
I
cried.
"'They
have
been
for
some
weeks.'
"We
all
stood
in
silence,
my
daughter
white
with
emotion,
but
still
holding
this
man
by
the
hand.
"'You
see
what
I
am
capable
of,
Elise,'
said
he.
"'I
see
that
you
are
capable
of
repentance
and
restitution,'
she
answered.
"'Yes,
thanks
to
your
influence!
I
leave
the
stones
in
your
hands,
sir.
Do
what
you
like
about
it.
But
remember
that
whatever
you
do
against
me,
is
done
against
the
future
husband
of
your
only
daughter.
You
will
hear
from
me
soon
again,
Elise.
It
is
the
last
time
that
I
will
ever
cause
pain
to
your
tender
heart,'
and
with
these
words
he
left
both
the
room
and
the
house.
"My
position
was
a
dreadful
one.
Here
I
was
with
these
precious
relics
in
my
possession,
and
how
could
I
return
them
without
a
scandal
and
an
exposure?
I
knew
the
depth
of
my
daughter's
nature
too
well
to
suppose
that
I
would
ever
be
able
to
detach
her
from
this
man
now
that
she
had
entirely
given
him
her
heart.
I
was
not
even
sure
how
far
it
was
right
to
detach
her
if
she
had
such
an
ameliorating
influence
over
him.
How
could
I
expose
him
without
injuring
her
and
how
far
was
I
justified
in
exposing
him
when
he
had
voluntarily
put
himself
into
my
power?
I
thought
and
thought
until
at
last
I
formed
a
resolution
which
may
seem
to
you
to
be
a
foolish
one,
and
yet,
if
I
had
to
do
it
again,
I
believe
it
would
be
the
best
course
open
to
me.
"My
idea
was
to
return
the
stones
without
anyone
being
the
wiser.
With
my
keys
I
could
get
into
the
museum
at
any
time,
and
I
was
confident
that
I
could
avoid
Simpson,
whose
hours
and
methods
were
familiar
to
me.
I
determined
to
take
no
one
into
my
confidence
not
even
my
daughter
whom
I
told
that
I
was
about
to
visit
my
brother
in
Scotland.
I
wanted
a
free
hand
for
a
few
nights,
without
inquiry
as
to
my
comings
and
goings.
To
this
end
I
took
a
room
in
Harding
Street
that
very
night,
with
an
intimation
that
I
was
a
Pressman,
and
that
I
should
keep
very
late
hours.
"That
night
I
made
my
way
into
the
museum,
and
I
replaced
four
of
the
stones.
It
was
hard
work,
and
took
me
all
night.
When
Simpson
came
round
I
always
heard
his
footsteps,
and
concealed
myself
in
the
mummy
case.
I
had
some
knowledge
of
gold
work,
but
was
far
less
skilful
than
the
thief
