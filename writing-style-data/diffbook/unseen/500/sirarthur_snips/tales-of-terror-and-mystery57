my
bills,
or
to
cash
any
further
post
obits
upon
an
unentailed
property.
Ruin
lay
right
across
my
path,
and
every
day
I
saw
it
clearer,
nearer,
and
more
absolutely
unavoidable.
What
made
me
feel
my
own
poverty
the
more
was
that,
apart
from
the
great
wealth
of
Lord
Southerton,
all
my
other
relations
were
fairly
well
to
do.
The
nearest
of
these
was
Everard
King,
my
father's
nephew
and
my
own
first
cousin,
who
had
spent
an
adventurous
life
in
Brazil,
and
had
now
returned
to
this
country
to
settle
down
on
his
fortune.
We
never
knew
how
he
made
his
money,
but
he
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
it,
for
he
bought
the
estate
of
Greylands,
near
Clipton
on
the
Marsh,
in
Suffolk.
For
the
first
year
of
his
residence
in
England
he
took
no
more
notice
of
me
than
my
miserly
uncle;
but
at
last
one
summer
morning,
to
my
very
great
relief
and
joy,
I
received
a
letter
asking
me
to
come
down
that
very
day
and
spend
a
short
visit
at
Greylands
Court.
I
was
expecting
a
rather
long
visit
to
Bankruptcy
Court
at
the
time,
and
this
interruption
seemed
almost
providential.
If
I
could
only
get
on
terms
with
this
unknown
relative
of
mine,
I
might
pull
through
yet.
For
the
family
credit
he
could
not
let
me
go
entirely
to
the
wall.
I
ordered
my
valet
to
pack
my
valise,
and
I
set
off
the
same
evening
for
Clipton
on
the
Marsh.
After
changing
at
Ipswich,
a
little
local
train
deposited
me
at
a
small,
deserted
station
lying
amidst
a
rolling
grassy
country,
with
a
sluggish
and
winding
river
curving
in
and
out
amidst
the
valleys,
between
high,
silted
banks,
which
showed
that
we
were
within
reach
of
the
tide.
No
carriage
was
awaiting
me
(I
found
afterwards
that
my
telegram
had
been
delayed),
so
I
hired
a
dogcart
at
the
local
inn.
The
driver,
an
excellent
fellow,
was
full
of
my
relative's
praises,
and
I
learned
from
him
that
Mr.
Everard
King
was
already
a
name
to
conjure
with
in
that
part
of
the
county.
He
had
entertained
the
school
children,
he
had
thrown
his
grounds
open
to
visitors,
he
had
subscribed
to
charities
in
short,
his
benevolence
had
been
so
universal
that
my
driver
could
only
account
for
it
on
the
supposition
that
he
had
parliamentary
ambitions.
My
attention
was
drawn
away
from
my
driver's
panegyric
by
the
appearance
of
a
very
beautiful
bird
which
settled
on
a
telegraph
post
beside
the
road.
At
first
I
thought
that
it
was
a
jay,
but
it
was
larger,
with
a
brighter
plumage.
The
driver
accounted
for
its
presence
at
once
by
saying
that
it
belonged
to
the
very
man
whom
we
were
about
to
visit.
It
seems
that
the
acclimatization
of
foreign
creatures
was
one
of
his
hobbies,
and
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
Brazil
a
number
of
birds
and
beasts
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
rear
in
England.
