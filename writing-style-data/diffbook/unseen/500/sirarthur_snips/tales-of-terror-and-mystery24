of
inscriptions,
fragments,
and
ornaments,
there
stood
the
famous
reconstruction
by
Kennedy
of
the
Baths
of
Caracalla,
which
excited
such
interest
and
admiration
when
it
was
exhibited
in
Berlin.
Amphorae
hung
from
the
ceiling,
and
a
litter
of
curiosities
strewed
the
rich
red
Turkey
carpet.
And
of
them
all
there
was
not
one
which
was
not
of
the
most
unimpeachable
authenticity,
and
of
the
utmost
rarity
and
value;
for
Kennedy,
though
little
more
than
thirty,
had
a
European
reputation
in
this
particular
branch
of
research,
and
was,
moreover,
provided
with
that
long
purse
which
either
proves
to
be
a
fatal
handicap
to
the
student's
energies,
or,
if
his
mind
is
still
true
to
its
purpose,
gives
him
an
enormous
advantage
in
the
race
for
fame.
Kennedy
had
often
been
seduced
by
whim
and
pleasure
from
his
studies,
but
his
mind
was
an
incisive
one,
capable
of
long
and
concentrated
efforts
which
ended
in
sharp
reactions
of
sensuous
languor.
His
handsome
face,
with
its
high,
white
forehead,
its
aggressive
nose,
and
its
somewhat
loose
and
sensual
mouth,
was
a
fair
index
of
the
compromise
between
strength
and
weakness
in
his
nature.
Of
a
very
different
type
was
his
companion,
Julius
Burger.
He
came
of
a
curious
blend,
a
German
father
and
an
Italian
mother,
with
the
robust
qualities
of
the
North
mingling
strangely
with
the
softer
graces
of
the
South.
Blue
Teutonic
eyes
lightened
his
sun
browned
face,
and
above
them
rose
a
square,
massive
forehead,
with
a
fringe
of
close
yellow
curls
lying
round
it.
His
strong,
firm
jaw
was
clean
shaven,
and
his
companion
had
frequently
remarked
how
much
it
suggested
those
old
Roman
busts
which
peered
out
from
the
shadows
in
the
corners
of
his
chamber.
Under
its
bluff
German
strength
there
lay
always
a
suggestion
of
Italian
subtlety,
but
the
smile
was
so
honest,
and
the
eyes
so
frank,
that
one
understood
that
this
was
only
an
indication
of
his
ancestry,
with
no
actual
bearing
upon
his
character.
In
age
and
in
reputation,
he
was
on
the
same
level
as
his
English
companion,
but
his
life
and
his
work
had
both
been
far
more
arduous.
Twelve
years
before,
he
had
come
as
a
poor
student
to
Rome,
and
had
lived
ever
since
upon
some
small
endowment
for
research
which
had
been
awarded
to
him
by
the
University
of
Bonn.
Painfully,
slowly,
and
doggedly,
with
extraordinary
tenacity
and
single
mindedness,
he
had
climbed
from
rung
to
rung
of
the
ladder
of
fame,
until
now
he
was
a
member
of
the
Berlin
Academy,
and
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
shortly
be
promoted
to
the
Chair
of
the
greatest
of
German
Universities.
But
the
singleness
of
purpose
which
had
brought
him
to
the
same
high
level
as
the
rich
and
brilliant
Englishman,
had
caused
him
in
everything
outside
their
work
to
stand
infinitely
below
him.
He
had
never
found
a
pause
in
his
studies
in
which
to
cultivate
the
social
graces.
It
was
only
when
he
