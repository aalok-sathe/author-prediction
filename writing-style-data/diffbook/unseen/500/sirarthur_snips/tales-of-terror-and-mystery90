their
faces
together
that
they
were
brother
and
sister.
"Are
you
really
prepared
for
this,
Charles?
It
is
noble
of
you,
but
you
fill
me
with
fears."
Her
voice
quavered
with
apprehension,
and
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
equally
moved,
though
he
was
making
strong
efforts
to
conceal
his
agitation.
"Yes,
yes,
dear;
it
is
all
settled,
it
is
all
decided;
in
fact,
there
is
no
other
possible
way,
that
I
can
see."
"There
is
one
obvious
way."
"No,
no,
Evelyn,
I
shall
never
abandon
you
never.
It
will
come
right
depend
upon
it;
it
will
come
right,
and
surely
it
looks
like
the
interference
of
Providence
that
so
perfect
an
instrument
should
be
put
into
our
hands."
My
position
was
embarrassing,
for
I
felt
that
for
the
instant
they
had
forgotten
my
presence.
But
Lord
Linchmere
came
back
suddenly
to
me
and
to
my
engagement.
"The
business
for
which
I
want
you,
Dr.
Hamilton,
is
that
you
should
put
yourself
absolutely
at
my
disposal.
I
wish
you
to
come
for
a
short
journey
with
me,
to
remain
always
at
my
side,
and
to
promise
to
do
without
question
whatever
I
may
ask
you,
however
unreasonable
it
may
appear
to
you
to
be."
"That
is
a
good
deal
to
ask,"
said
I.
"Unfortunately
I
cannot
put
it
more
plainly,
for
I
do
not
myself
know
what
turn
matters
may
take.
You
may
be
sure,
however,
that
you
will
not
be
asked
to
do
anything
which
your
conscience
does
not
approve;
and
I
promise
you
that,
when
all
is
over,
you
will
be
proud
to
have
been
concerned
in
so
good
a
work."
"If
it
ends
happily,"
said
the
lady.
"Exactly;
if
it
ends
happily,"
his
lordship
repeated.
"And
terms?"
I
asked.
"Twenty
pounds
a
day."
I
was
amazed
at
the
sum,
and
must
have
showed
my
surprise
upon
my
features.
"It
is
a
rare
combination
of
qualities,
as
must
have
struck
you
when
you
first
read
the
advertisement,"
said
Lord
Linchmere;
"such
varied
gifts
may
well
command
a
high
return,
and
I
do
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
duties
might
be
arduous
or
even
dangerous.
Besides,
it
is
possible
that
one
or
two
days
may
bring
the
matter
to
an
end."
"Please
God!"
sighed
his
sister.
"So
now,
Dr.
Hamilton,
may
I
rely
upon
your
aid?"
"Most
undoubtedly,"
said
I.
"You
have
only
to
tell
me
what
my
duties
are."
"Your
first
duty
will
be
to
return
to
your
home.
You
will
pack
up
whatever
you
may
need
for
a
short
visit
to
the
country.
We
start
together
from
Paddington
Station
at
3:40
this
afternoon."
"Do
we
go
far?"
"As
far
as
Pangbourne.
Meet
me
at
the
bookstall
at
3:30.
I
shall
have
the
tickets.
Goodbye,
Dr.
Hamilton!
And,
by
the
way,
there
are
two
things
which
I
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
bring
with
you,
in
case
you
have
them.
One
is
your
case
for
collecting
beetles,
and
the
other
is
a
stick,
and
the
