and
forgiveness.
"It
was
only
last
night
that
I
returned
to
England,
and
during
all
this
time
I
have
heard
nothing
of
the
sensation
which
my
supposed
death
had
caused,
nor
of
the
accusation
that
Mr.
Arthur
Morton
had
been
concerned
in
it.
It
was
in
a
late
evening
paper
that
I
read
an
account
of
the
proceedings
of
yesterday,
and
I
have
come
this
morning
as
fast
as
an
express
train
could
bring
me
to
testify
to
the
truth."
Such
was
the
remarkable
statement
of
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana
which
brought
the
trial
to
a
sudden
termination.
A
subsequent
investigation
corroborated
it
to
the
extent
of
finding
out
the
vessel
in
which
his
brother
Ernest
Lana
had
come
over
from
South
America.
The
ship's
doctor
was
able
to
testify
that
he
had
complained
of
a
weak
heart
during
the
voyage,
and
that
his
symptoms
were
consistent
with
such
a
death
as
was
described.
As
to
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana,
he
returned
to
the
village
from
which
he
had
made
so
dramatic
a
disappearance,
and
a
complete
reconciliation
was
effected
between
him
and
the
young
squire,
the
latter
having
acknowledged
that
he
had
entirely
misunderstood
the
other's
motives
in
withdrawing
from
his
engagement.
That
another
reconciliation
followed
may
be
judged
from
a
notice
extracted
from
a
prominent
column
in
the
Morning
Post:
"A
marriage
was
solemnized
upon
September
19th,
by
the
Rev.
Stephen
Johnson,
at
the
parish
church
of
Bishop's
Crossing,
between
Aloysius
Xavier
Lana,
son
of
Don
Alfredo
Lana,
formerly
Foreign
Minister
of
the
Argentine
Republic,
and
Frances
Morton,
only
daughter
of
the
late
James
Morton,
J.P.,
of
Leigh
Hall,
Bishop's
Crossing,
Lancashire."
The
Jew's
Breastplate
My
particular
friend,
Ward
Mortimer,
was
one
of
the
best
men
of
his
day
at
everything
connected
with
Oriental
archaeology.
He
had
written
largely
upon
the
subject,
he
had
lived
two
years
in
a
tomb
at
Thebes,
while
he
excavated
in
the
Valley
of
the
Kings,
and
finally
he
had
created
a
considerable
sensation
by
his
exhumation
of
the
alleged
mummy
of
Cleopatra
in
the
inner
room
of
the
Temple
of
Horus,
at
Philae.
With
such
a
record
at
the
age
of
thirty
one,
it
was
felt
that
a
considerable
career
lay
before
him,
and
no
one
was
surprised
when
he
was
elected
to
the
curatorship
of
the
Belmore
Street
Museum,
which
carries
with
it
the
lectureship
at
the
Oriental
College,
and
an
income
which
has
sunk
with
the
fall
in
land,
but
which
still
remains
at
that
ideal
sum
which
is
large
enough
to
encourage
an
investigator,
but
not
so
large
as
to
enervate
him.
There
was
only
one
reason
which
made
Ward
Mortimer's
position
a
little
difficult
at
the
Belmore
Street
Museum,
and
that
was
the
extreme
eminence
of
the
man
whom
he
had
to
succeed.
Professor
Andreas
was
a
profound
scholar
and
a
man
of
European
reputation.
His
lectures
were
frequented
by
students
from
every
part
of
the
world,
and
his
admirable
management
of
the
collection
intrusted
to
his
care
was
a
