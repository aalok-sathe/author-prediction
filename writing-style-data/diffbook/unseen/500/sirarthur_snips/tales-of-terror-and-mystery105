by
no
means
so
perilous
as
it
might
appear.
"Having
now
got
our
young
man,
without
his
ticket,
into
the
carriage
in
which
the
elder
man
and
the
young
woman
are
travelling,
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
a
violent
scene
ensued.
It
is
possible
that
the
pair
were
also
Americans,
which
is
the
more
probable
as
the
man
carried
a
weapon
an
unusual
thing
in
England.
If
our
supposition
of
incipient
mania
is
correct,
the
young
man
is
likely
to
have
assaulted
the
other.
As
the
upshot
of
the
quarrel
the
elder
man
shot
the
intruder,
and
then
made
his
escape
from
the
carriage,
taking
the
young
lady
with
him.
We
will
suppose
that
all
this
happened
very
rapidly,
and
that
the
train
was
still
going
at
so
slow
a
pace
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
them
to
leave
it.
A
woman
might
leave
a
train
going
at
eight
miles
an
hour.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
we
know
that
this
woman
DID
do
so.
"And
now
we
have
to
fit
in
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage.
Presuming
that
we
have,
up
to
this
point,
reconstructed
the
tragedy
correctly,
we
shall
find
nothing
in
this
other
man
to
cause
us
to
reconsider
our
conclusions.
According
to
my
theory,
this
man
saw
the
young
fellow
cross
from
one
train
to
the
other,
saw
him
open
the
door,
heard
the
pistol
shot,
saw
the
two
fugitives
spring
out
on
to
the
line,
realized
that
murder
had
been
done,
and
sprang
out
himself
in
pursuit.
Why
he
has
never
been
heard
of
since
whether
he
met
his
own
death
in
the
pursuit,
or
whether,
as
is
more
likely,
he
was
made
to
realize
that
it
was
not
a
case
for
his
interference
is
a
detail
which
we
have
at
present
no
means
of
explaining.
I
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
difficulties
in
the
way.
At
first
sight,
it
might
seem
improbable
that
at
such
a
moment
a
murderer
would
burden
himself
in
his
flight
with
a
brown
leather
bag.
My
answer
is
that
he
was
well
aware
that
if
the
bag
were
found
his
identity
would
be
established.
It
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
take
it
with
him.
My
theory
stands
or
falls
upon
one
point,
and
I
call
upon
the
railway
company
to
make
strict
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
ticket
was
found
unclaimed
in
the
local
train
through
Harrow
and
King's
Langley
upon
the
18th
of
March.
If
such
a
ticket
were
found
my
case
is
proved.
If
not,
my
theory
may
still
be
the
correct
one,
for
it
is
conceivable
either
that
he
travelled
without
a
ticket
or
that
his
ticket
was
lost."
To
this
elaborate
and
plausible
hypothesis
the
answer
of
the
police
and
of
the
company
was,
first,
that
no
such
ticket
was
found;
secondly,
that
the
slow
train
would
never
run
parallel
to
the
express;
and,
thirdly,
that
the
local
train
had
been
stationary
in
King's
Langley
Station
when
the
express,
going
