which
had
at
least
ingenuity
to
recommend
it,
and
I
cannot
do
better
than
append
it
in
his
own
words.
"Whatever
may
be
the
truth,"
said
he,
"it
must
depend
upon
some
bizarre
and
rare
combination
of
events,
so
we
need
have
no
hesitation
in
postulating
such
events
in
our
explanation.
In
the
absence
of
data
we
must
abandon
the
analytic
or
scientific
method
of
investigation,
and
must
approach
it
in
the
synthetic
fashion.
In
a
word,
instead
of
taking
known
events
and
deducing
from
them
what
has
occurred,
we
must
build
up
a
fanciful
explanation
if
it
will
only
be
consistent
with
known
events.
We
can
then
test
this
explanation
by
any
fresh
facts
which
may
arise.
If
they
all
fit
into
their
places,
the
probability
is
that
we
are
upon
the
right
track,
and
with
each
fresh
fact
this
probability
increases
in
a
geometrical
progression
until
the
evidence
becomes
final
and
convincing.
"Now,
there
is
one
most
remarkable
and
suggestive
fact
which
has
not
met
with
the
attention
which
it
deserves.
There
is
a
local
train
running
through
Harrow
and
King's
Langley,
which
is
timed
in
such
a
way
that
the
express
must
have
overtaken
it
at
or
about
the
period
when
it
eased
down
its
speed
to
eight
miles
an
hour
on
account
of
the
repairs
of
the
line.
The
two
trains
would
at
that
time
be
travelling
in
the
same
direction
at
a
similar
rate
of
speed
and
upon
parallel
lines.
It
is
within
every
one's
experience
how,
under
such
circumstances,
the
occupant
of
each
carriage
can
see
very
plainly
the
passengers
in
the
other
carriages
opposite
to
him.
The
lamps
of
the
express
had
been
lit
at
Willesden,
so
that
each
compartment
was
brightly
illuminated,
and
most
visible
to
an
observer
from
outside.
"Now,
the
sequence
of
events
as
I
reconstruct
them
would
be
after
this
fashion.
This
young
man
with
the
abnormal
number
of
watches
was
alone
in
the
carriage
of
the
slow
train.
His
ticket,
with
his
papers
and
gloves
and
other
things,
was,
we
will
suppose,
on
the
seat
beside
him.
He
was
probably
an
American,
and
also
probably
a
man
of
weak
intellect.
The
excessive
wearing
of
jewellery
is
an
early
symptom
in
some
forms
of
mania.
"As
he
sat
watching
the
carriages
of
the
express
which
were
(on
account
of
the
state
of
the
line)
going
at
the
same
pace
as
himself,
he
suddenly
saw
some
people
in
it
whom
he
knew.
We
will
suppose
for
the
sake
of
our
theory
that
these
people
were
a
woman
whom
he
loved
and
a
man
whom
he
hated
and
who
in
return
hated
him.
The
young
man
was
excitable
and
impulsive.
He
opened
the
door
of
his
carriage,
stepped
from
the
footboard
of
the
local
train
to
the
footboard
of
the
express,
opened
the
other
door,
and
made
his
way
into
the
presence
of
these
two
people.
The
feat
(on
the
supposition
that
the
trains
were
going
at
the
same
pace)
is
