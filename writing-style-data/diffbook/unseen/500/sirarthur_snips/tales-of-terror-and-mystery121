darkly
all
round
me.
A
dim
radiance
from
the
moonlight
came
through
the
farther
window,
and
against
this
lighter
background
I
saw
that
Sir
John
Bollamore
was
sitting
at
his
study
table.
His
well
set
head
and
clearly
cut
profile
were
sharply
outlined
against
the
glimmering
square
behind
him.
He
bent
as
I
watched
him,
and
I
heard
the
sharp
turning
of
a
key
and
the
rasping
of
metal
upon
metal.
As
if
in
a
dream
I
was
vaguely
conscious
that
this
was
the
japanned
box
which
stood
in
front
of
him,
and
that
he
had
drawn
something
out
of
it,
something
squat
and
uncouth,
which
now
lay
before
him
upon
the
table.
I
never
realized
it
never
occurred
to
my
bemuddled
and
torpid
brain
that
I
was
intruding
upon
his
privacy,
that
he
imagined
himself
to
be
alone
in
the
room.
And
then,
just
as
it
rushed
upon
my
horrified
perceptions,
and
I
had
half
risen
to
announce
my
presence,
I
heard
a
strange,
crisp,
metallic
clicking,
and
then
the
voice.
Yes,
it
was
a
woman's
voice;
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
it.
But
a
voice
so
charged
with
entreaty
and
with
yearning
love,
that
it
will
ring
for
ever
in
my
ears.
It
came
with
a
curious
faraway
tinkle,
but
every
word
was
clear,
though
faint
very
faint,
for
they
were
the
last
words
of
a
dying
woman.
"I
am
not
really
gone,
John,"
said
the
thin,
gasping
voice.
"I
am
here
at
your
very
elbow,
and
shall
be
until
we
meet
once
more.
I
die
happy
to
think
that
morning
and
night
you
will
hear
my
voice.
Oh,
John,
be
strong,
be
strong,
until
we
meet
again."
I
say
that
I
had
risen
in
order
to
announce
my
presence,
but
I
could
not
do
so
while
the
voice
was
sounding.
I
could
only
remain
half
lying,
half
sitting,
paralysed,
astounded,
listening
to
those
yearning
distant
musical
words.
And
he
he
was
so
absorbed
that
even
if
I
had
spoken
he
might
not
have
heard
me.
But
with
the
silence
of
the
voice
came
my
half
articulated
apologies
and
explanations.
He
sprang
across
the
room,
switched
on
the
electric
light,
and
in
its
white
glare
I
saw
him,
his
eyes
gleaming
with
anger,
his
face
twisted
with
passion,
as
the
hapless
charwoman
may
have
seen
him
weeks
before.
"Mr.
Colmore!"
he
cried.
"You
here!
What
is
the
meaning
of
this,
sir?"
With
halting
words
I
explained
it
all,
my
neuralgia,
the
narcotic,
my
luckless
sleep
and
singular
awakening.
As
he
listened
the
glow
of
anger
faded
from
his
face,
and
the
sad,
impassive
mask
closed
once
more
over
his
features.
"My
secret
is
yours,
Mr.
Colmore,"
said
he.
"I
have
only
myself
to
blame
for
relaxing
my
precautions.
Half
confidences
are
worse
than
no
confidences,
and
so
you
may
know
all
since
you
know
so
much.
The
story
may
go
where
you
will
when
I
have
passed
away,
but
until
then
I
rely
upon
your
sense
