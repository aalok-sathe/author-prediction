the
other
letters
from
left
to
right
are,
M,
M,
a
small
d,
A,
a
small
d,
and
then
the
final
B."
"Yes,
I
am
sure
that
you
are
right.
I
can
make
out
the
two
small
d's
quite
plainly."
"What
I
have
read
to
you
tonight,"
said
Dacre,
"is
the
official
record
of
the
trial
of
Marie
Madeleine
d'Aubray,
Marquise
de
Brinvilliers,
one
of
the
most
famous
poisoners
and
murderers
of
all
time."
I
sat
in
silence,
overwhelmed
at
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
incident,
and
at
the
completeness
of
the
proof
with
which
Dacre
had
exposed
its
real
meaning.
In
a
vague
way
I
remembered
some
details
of
the
woman's
career,
her
unbridled
debauchery,
the
cold
blooded
and
protracted
torture
of
her
sick
father,
the
murder
of
her
brothers
for
motives
of
petty
gain.
I
recollected
also
that
the
bravery
of
her
end
had
done
something
to
atone
for
the
horror
of
her
life,
and
that
all
Paris
had
sympathized
with
her
last
moments,
and
blessed
her
as
a
martyr
within
a
few
days
of
the
time
when
they
had
cursed
her
as
a
murderess.
One
objection,
and
one
only,
occurred
to
my
mind.
"How
came
her
initials
and
her
badge
of
rank
upon
the
filler?
Surely
they
did
not
carry
their
mediaeval
homage
to
the
nobility
to
the
point
of
decorating
instruments
of
torture
with
their
titles?"
"I
was
puzzled
with
the
same
point,"
said
Dacre,
"but
it
admits
of
a
simple
explanation.
The
case
excited
extraordinary
interest
at
the
time,
and
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
La
Reynie,
the
head
of
the
police,
should
retain
this
filler
as
a
grim
souvenir.
It
was
not
often
that
a
marchioness
of
France
underwent
the
extraordinary
question.
That
he
should
engrave
her
initials
upon
it
for
the
information
of
others
was
surely
a
very
ordinary
proceeding
upon
his
part."
"And
this?"
I
asked,
pointing
to
the
marks
upon
the
leathern
neck.
"She
was
a
cruel
tigress,"
said
Dacre,
as
he
turned
away.
"I
think
it
is
evident
that
like
other
tigresses
her
teeth
were
both
strong
and
sharp."
The
New
Catacomb
"Look
here,
Burger,"
said
Kennedy,
"I
do
wish
that
you
would
confide
in
me."
The
two
famous
students
of
Roman
remains
sat
together
in
Kennedy's
comfortable
room
overlooking
the
Corso.
The
night
was
cold,
and
they
had
both
pulled
up
their
chairs
to
the
unsatisfactory
Italian
stove
which
threw
out
a
zone
of
stuffiness
rather
than
of
warmth.
Outside
under
the
bright
winter
stars
lay
the
modern
Rome,
the
long,
double
chain
of
the
electric
lamps,
the
brilliantly
lighted
cafes,
the
rushing
carriages,
and
the
dense
throng
upon
the
footpaths.
But
inside,
in
the
sumptuous
chamber
of
the
rich
young
English
archaeologist,
there
was
only
old
Rome
to
be
seen.
Cracked
and
timeworn
friezes
hung
upon
the
walls,
grey
old
busts
of
senators
and
soldiers
with
their
fighting
heads
and
their
hard,
cruel
faces
peered
out
from
the
corners.
