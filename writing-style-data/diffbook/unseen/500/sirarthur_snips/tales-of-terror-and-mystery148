will
not
be
angry
when
you
know
everything
at
least,
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me.
I
had
a
key
to
your
side
door
and
also
to
the
museum
door.
I
did
not
give
them
up
when
I
left.
And
so
you
see
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
let
myself
into
the
museum.
I
used
to
come
in
early
before
the
crowd
had
cleared
from
the
street.
Then
I
hid
myself
in
the
mummy
case,
and
took
refuge
there
whenever
Simpson
came
round.
I
could
always
hear
him
coming.
I
used
to
leave
in
the
same
way
as
I
came."
"You
ran
a
risk."
"I
had
to."
"But
why?
What
on
earth
was
your
object
YOU
to
do
a
thing
like
that!"
Mortimer
pointed
reproachfully
at
the
plate
which
lay
before
him
on
the
table.
"I
could
devise
no
other
means.
I
thought
and
thought,
but
there
was
no
alternate
except
a
hideous
public
scandal,
and
a
private
sorrow
which
would
have
clouded
our
lives.
I
acted
for
the
best,
incredible
as
it
may
seem
to
you,
and
I
only
ask
your
attention
to
enable
me
to
prove
it."
"I
will
hear
what
you
have
to
say
before
I
take
any
further
steps,"
said
Mortimer,
grimly.
"I
am
determined
to
hold
back
nothing,
and
to
take
you
both
completely
into
my
confidence.
I
will
leave
it
to
your
own
generosity
how
far
you
will
use
the
facts
with
which
I
supply
you."
"We
have
the
essential
facts
already."
"And
yet
you
understand
nothing.
Let
me
go
back
to
what
passed
a
few
weeks
ago,
and
I
will
make
it
all
clear
to
you.
Believe
me
that
what
I
say
is
the
absolute
and
exact
truth.
"You
have
met
the
person
who
calls
himself
Captain
Wilson.
I
say
'calls
himself'
because
I
have
reason
now
to
believe
that
it
is
not
his
correct
name.
It
would
take
me
too
long
if
I
were
to
describe
all
the
means
by
which
he
obtained
an
introduction
to
me
and
ingratiated
himself
into
my
friendship
and
the
affection
of
my
daughter.
He
brought
letters
from
foreign
colleagues
which
compelled
me
to
show
him
some
attention.
And
then,
by
his
own
attainments,
which
are
considerable,
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
a
very
welcome
visitor
at
my
rooms.
When
I
learned
that
my
daughter's
affections
had
been
gained
by
him,
I
may
have
thought
it
premature,
but
I
certainly
was
not
surprised,
for
he
had
a
charm
of
manner
and
of
conversation
which
would
have
made
him
conspicuous
in
any
society.
"He
was
much
interested
in
Oriental
antiquities,
and
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
justified
his
interest.
Often
when
he
spent
the
evening
with
us
he
would
ask
permission
to
go
down
into
the
museum
and
have
an
opportunity
of
privately
inspecting
the
various
specimens.
You
can
imagine
that
I,
as
an
enthusiast,
was
in
sympathy
with
such
a
request,
and
that
I
felt
no
surprise
at
the
constancy
of
his
visits.
