by
the
published
depth
of
the
canal,
which
was
entirely
insufficient
to
conceal
so
large
an
object.
The
second
correspondent
wrote
calling
attention
to
the
bag
which
appeared
to
be
the
sole
luggage
which
the
travellers
had
brought
with
them,
and
suggesting
that
some
novel
explosive
of
immense
and
pulverizing
power
might
have
been
concealed
in
it.
The
obvious
absurdity,
however,
of
supposing
that
the
whole
train
might
be
blown
to
dust
while
the
metals
remained
uninjured
reduced
any
such
explanation
to
a
farce.
The
investigation
had
drifted
into
this
hopeless
position
when
a
new
and
most
unexpected
incident
occurred.
This
was
nothing
less
than
the
receipt
by
Mrs.
McPherson
of
a
letter
from
her
husband,
James
McPherson,
who
had
been
the
guard
on
the
missing
train.
The
letter,
which
was
dated
July
5th,
1890,
was
posted
from
New
York
and
came
to
hand
upon
July
14th.
Some
doubts
were
expressed
as
to
its
genuine
character
but
Mrs.
McPherson
was
positive
as
to
the
writing,
and
the
fact
that
it
contained
a
remittance
of
a
hundred
dollars
in
five
dollar
notes
was
enough
in
itself
to
discount
the
idea
of
a
hoax.
No
address
was
given
in
the
letter,
which
ran
in
this
way:
MY
DEAR
WIFE,
"I
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal,
and
I
find
it
very
hard
to
give
you
up.
The
same
with
Lizzie.
I
try
to
fight
against
it,
but
it
will
always
come
back
to
me.
I
send
you
some
money
which
will
change
into
twenty
English
pounds.
This
should
be
enough
to
bring
both
Lizzie
and
you
across
the
Atlantic,
and
you
will
find
the
Hamburg
boats
which
stop
at
Southampton
very
good
boats,
and
cheaper
than
Liverpool.
If
you
could
come
here
and
stop
at
the
Johnston
House
I
would
try
and
send
you
word
how
to
meet,
but
things
are
very
difficult
with
me
at
present,
and
I
am
not
very
happy,
finding
it
hard
to
give
you
both
up.
So
no
more
at
present,
from
your
loving
husband,
"James
McPherson."
For
a
time
it
was
confidently
anticipated
that
this
letter
would
lead
to
the
clearing
up
of
the
whole
matter,
the
more
so
as
it
was
ascertained
that
a
passenger
who
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
the
missing
guard
had
travelled
from
Southampton
under
the
name
of
Summers
in
the
Hamburg
and
New
York
liner
Vistula,
which
started
upon
the
7th
of
June.
Mrs.
McPherson
and
her
sister
Lizzie
Dolton
went
across
to
New
York
as
directed
and
stayed
for
three
weeks
at
the
Johnston
House,
without
hearing
anything
from
the
missing
man.
It
is
probable
that
some
injudicious
comments
in
the
Press
may
have
warned
him
that
the
police
were
using
them
as
a
bait.
However,
this
may
be,
it
is
certain
that
he
neither
wrote
nor
came,
and
the
women
were
eventually
compelled
to
return
to
Liverpool.
And
so
the
matter
stood,
and
has
continued
to
stand
up
to
the
present
year
of
1898.
Incredible
as
it
may
