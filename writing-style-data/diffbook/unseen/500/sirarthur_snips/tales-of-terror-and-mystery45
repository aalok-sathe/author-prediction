Armitage's
explanation
is
too
absurd
for
discussion,
and
yet
that
sound
was
certainly
very
strange.
It
still
rings
in
my
ears
as
I
write.
April
20.
In
the
last
three
days
I
have
made
several
expeditions
to
the
Blue
John
Gap,
and
have
even
penetrated
some
short
distance,
but
my
bicycle
lantern
is
so
small
and
weak
that
I
dare
not
trust
myself
very
far.
I
shall
do
the
thing
more
systematically.
I
have
heard
no
sound
at
all,
and
could
almost
believe
that
I
had
been
the
victim
of
some
hallucination
suggested,
perhaps,
by
Armitage's
conversation.
Of
course,
the
whole
idea
is
absurd,
and
yet
I
must
confess
that
those
bushes
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
do
present
an
appearance
as
if
some
heavy
creature
had
forced
its
way
through
them.
I
begin
to
be
keenly
interested.
I
have
said
nothing
to
the
Miss
Allertons,
for
they
are
quite
superstitious
enough
already,
but
I
have
bought
some
candles,
and
mean
to
investigate
for
myself.
I
observed
this
morning
that
among
the
numerous
tufts
of
sheep's
wool
which
lay
among
the
bushes
near
the
cavern
there
was
one
which
was
smeared
with
blood.
Of
course,
my
reason
tells
me
that
if
sheep
wander
into
such
rocky
places
they
are
likely
to
injure
themselves,
and
yet
somehow
that
splash
of
crimson
gave
me
a
sudden
shock,
and
for
a
moment
I
found
myself
shrinking
back
in
horror
from
the
old
Roman
arch.
A
fetid
breath
seemed
to
ooze
from
the
black
depths
into
which
I
peered.
Could
it
indeed
be
possible
that
some
nameless
thing,
some
dreadful
presence,
was
lurking
down
yonder?
I
should
have
been
incapable
of
such
feelings
in
the
days
of
my
strength,
but
one
grows
more
nervous
and
fanciful
when
one's
health
is
shaken.
For
the
moment
I
weakened
in
my
resolution,
and
was
ready
to
leave
the
secret
of
the
old
mine,
if
one
exists,
for
ever
unsolved.
But
tonight
my
interest
has
returned
and
my
nerves
grown
more
steady.
Tomorrow
I
trust
that
I
shall
have
gone
more
deeply
into
this
matter.
April
22.
Let
me
try
and
set
down
as
accurately
as
I
can
my
extraordinary
experience
of
yesterday.
I
started
in
the
afternoon,
and
made
my
way
to
the
Blue
John
Gap.
I
confess
that
my
misgivings
returned
as
I
gazed
into
its
depths,
and
I
wished
that
I
had
brought
a
companion
to
share
my
exploration.
Finally,
with
a
return
of
resolution,
I
lit
my
candle,
pushed
my
way
through
the
briars,
and
descended
into
the
rocky
shaft.
It
went
down
at
an
acute
angle
for
some
fifty
feet,
the
floor
being
covered
with
broken
stone.
Thence
there
extended
a
long,
straight
passage
cut
in
the
solid
rock.
I
am
no
geologist,
but
the
lining
of
this
corridor
was
certainly
of
some
harder
material
than
limestone,
for
there
were
points
where
I
could
actually
see
the
tool
marks
which
the
old
miners
had
left
in
their
excavation,
as
fresh
as
if
