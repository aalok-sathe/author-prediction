no
hat
rack.
Deep
grey
dust
and
heavy
festoons
of
cobwebs
met
his
eyes
everywhere.
Following
the
old
woman
up
the
winding
stair,
his
firm
footfall
echoed
harshly
through
the
silent
house.
There
was
no
carpet.
The
bedroom
was
on
the
second
landing.
Douglas
Stone
followed
the
old
nurse
into
it,
with
the
merchant
at
his
heels.
Here,
at
least,
there
was
furniture
and
to
spare.
The
floor
was
littered
and
the
corners
piled
with
Turkish
cabinets,
inlaid
tables,
coats
of
chain
mail,
strange
pipes,
and
grotesque
weapons.
A
single
small
lamp
stood
upon
a
bracket
on
the
wall.
Douglas
Stone
took
it
down,
and
picking
his
way
among
the
lumber,
walked
over
to
a
couch
in
the
corner,
on
which
lay
a
woman
dressed
in
the
Turkish
fashion,
with
yashmak
and
veil.
The
lower
part
of
the
face
was
exposed,
and
the
surgeon
saw
a
jagged
cut
which
zigzagged
along
the
border
of
the
under
lip.
"You
will
forgive
the
yashmak,"
said
the
Turk.
"You
know
our
views
about
women
in
the
East."
But
the
surgeon
was
not
thinking
about
the
yashmak.
This
was
no
longer
a
woman
to
him.
It
was
a
case.
He
stooped
and
examined
the
wound
carefully.
"There
are
no
signs
of
irritation,"
said
he.
"We
might
delay
the
operation
until
local
symptoms
develop."
The
husband
wrung
his
hands
in
uncontrollable
agitation.
"Oh!
sir,
sir,"
he
cried.
"Do
not
trifle.
You
do
not
know.
It
is
deadly.
I
know,
and
I
give
you
my
assurance
that
an
operation
is
absolutely
necessary.
Only
the
knife
can
save
her."
"And
yet
I
am
inclined
to
wait,"
said
Douglas
Stone.
"That
is
enough,"
the
Turk
cried,
angrily.
"Every
minute
is
of
importance,
and
I
cannot
stand
here
and
see
my
wife
allowed
to
sink.
It
only
remains
for
me
to
give
you
my
thanks
for
having
come,
and
to
call
in
some
other
surgeon
before
it
is
too
late."
Douglas
Stone
hesitated.
To
refund
that
hundred
pounds
was
no
pleasant
matter.
But
of
course
if
he
left
the
case
he
must
return
the
money.
And
if
the
Turk
were
right
and
the
woman
died,
his
position
before
a
coroner
might
be
an
embarrassing
one.
"You
have
had
personal
experience
of
this
poison?"
he
asked.
"I
have."
"And
you
assure
me
that
an
operation
is
needful."
"I
swear
it
by
all
that
I
hold
sacred."
"The
disfigurement
will
be
frightful."
"I
can
understand
that
the
mouth
will
not
be
a
pretty
one
to
kiss."
Douglas
Stone
turned
fiercely
upon
the
man.
The
speech
was
a
brutal
one.
But
the
Turk
has
his
own
fashion
of
talk
and
of
thought,
and
there
was
no
time
for
wrangling.
Douglas
Stone
drew
a
bistoury
from
his
case,
opened
it
and
felt
the
keen
straight
edge
with
his
forefinger.
Then
he
held
the
lamp
closer
to
the
bed.
Two
dark
eyes
were
gazing
up
at
him
through
the
slit
in
the
yashmak.
They
were
all
iris,
and
the
pupil
was
hardly
to
be
