commonplace
in
all
learned
societies.
There
was,
therefore,
considerable
surprise
when,
at
the
age
of
fifty
five,
he
suddenly
resigned
his
position
and
retired
from
those
duties
which
had
been
both
his
livelihood
and
his
pleasure.
He
and
his
daughter
left
the
comfortable
suite
of
rooms
which
had
formed
his
official
residence
in
connection
with
the
museum,
and
my
friend,
Mortimer,
who
was
a
bachelor,
took
up
his
quarters
there.
On
hearing
of
Mortimer's
appointment
Professor
Andreas
had
written
him
a
very
kindly
and
flattering
congratulatory
letter.
I
was
actually
present
at
their
first
meeting,
and
I
went
with
Mortimer
round
the
museum
when
the
Professor
showed
us
the
admirable
collection
which
he
had
cherished
so
long.
The
Professor's
beautiful
daughter
and
a
young
man,
Captain
Wilson,
who
was,
as
I
understood,
soon
to
be
her
husband,
accompanied
us
in
our
inspection.
There
were
fifteen
rooms,
but
the
Babylonian,
the
Syrian,
and
the
central
hall,
which
contained
the
Jewish
and
Egyptian
collection,
were
the
finest
of
all.
Professor
Andreas
was
a
quiet,
dry,
elderly
man,
with
a
clean
shaven
face
and
an
impassive
manner,
but
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
and
his
features
quickened
into
enthusiastic
life
as
he
pointed
out
to
us
the
rarity
and
the
beauty
of
some
of
his
specimens.
His
hand
lingered
so
fondly
over
them,
that
one
could
read
his
pride
in
them
and
the
grief
in
his
heart
now
that
they
were
passing
from
his
care
into
that
of
another.
He
had
shown
us
in
turn
his
mummies,
his
papyri,
his
rare
scarabs,
his
inscriptions,
his
Jewish
relics,
and
his
duplication
of
the
famous
seven
branched
candlestick
of
the
Temple,
which
was
brought
to
Rome
by
Titus,
and
which
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
lying
at
this
instant
in
the
bed
of
the
Tiber.
Then
he
approached
a
case
which
stood
in
the
very
centre
of
the
hall,
and
he
looked
down
through
the
glass
with
reverence
in
his
attitude
and
manner.
"This
is
no
novelty
to
an
expert
like
yourself,
Mr.
Mortimer,"
said
he;
"but
I
daresay
that
your
friend,
Mr.
Jackson,
will
be
interested
to
see
it."
Leaning
over
the
case
I
saw
an
object,
some
five
inches
square,
which
consisted
of
twelve
precious
stones
in
a
framework
of
gold,
with
golden
hooks
at
two
of
the
corners.
The
stones
were
all
varying
in
sort
and
colour,
but
they
were
of
the
same
size.
Their
shapes,
arrangement,
and
gradation
of
tint
made
me
think
of
a
box
of
water
colour
paints.
Each
stone
had
some
hieroglyphic
scratched
upon
its
surface.
"You
have
heard,
Mr.
Jackson,
of
the
urim
and
thummim?"
I
had
heard
the
term,
but
my
idea
of
its
meaning
was
exceedingly
vague.
"The
urim
and
thummim
was
a
name
given
to
the
jewelled
plate
which
lay
upon
the
breast
of
the
high
priest
of
the
Jews.
They
had
a
very
special
feeling
of
reverence
for
it
something
of
the
feeling
which
an
ancient
Roman
might
have
for
the
Sibylline
books
