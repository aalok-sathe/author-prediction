traces
of
the
missing
special.
It
is
quite
certain
that
she
passed
here,
and
that
she
did
not
arrive
at
Barton
Moss.
We
have
detached
engine
from
goods
train,
and
I
have
myself
ridden
down
the
line,
but
all
is
clear,
and
there
is
no
sign
of
any
accident."
Mr.
Bland
tore
his
hair
in
his
perplexity.
"This
is
rank
lunacy,
Hood!"
he
cried.
"Does
a
train
vanish
into
thin
air
in
England
in
broad
daylight?
The
thing
is
preposterous.
An
engine,
a
tender,
two
carriages,
a
van,
five
human
beings
and
all
lost
on
a
straight
line
of
railway!
Unless
we
get
something
positive
within
the
next
hour
I'll
take
Inspector
Collins,
and
go
down
myself."
And
then
at
last
something
positive
did
occur.
It
took
the
shape
of
another
telegram
from
Kenyon
Junction.
"Regret
to
report
that
the
dead
body
of
John
Slater,
driver
of
the
special
train,
has
just
been
found
among
the
gorse
bushes
at
a
point
two
and
a
quarter
miles
from
the
Junction.
Had
fallen
from
his
engine,
pitched
down
the
embankment,
and
rolled
among
the
bushes.
Injuries
to
his
head,
from
the
fall,
appear
to
be
cause
of
death.
Ground
has
now
been
carefully
examined,
and
there
is
no
trace
of
the
missing
train."
The
country
was,
as
has
already
been
stated,
in
the
throes
of
a
political
crisis,
and
the
attention
of
the
public
was
further
distracted
by
the
important
and
sensational
developments
in
Paris,
where
a
huge
scandal
threatened
to
destroy
the
Government
and
to
wreck
the
reputations
of
many
of
the
leading
men
in
France.
The
papers
were
full
of
these
events,
and
the
singular
disappearance
of
the
special
train
attracted
less
attention
than
would
have
been
the
case
in
more
peaceful
times.
The
grotesque
nature
of
the
event
helped
to
detract
from
its
importance,
for
the
papers
were
disinclined
to
believe
the
facts
as
reported
to
them.
More
than
one
of
the
London
journals
treated
the
matter
as
an
ingenious
hoax,
until
the
coroner's
inquest
upon
the
unfortunate
driver
(an
inquest
which
elicited
nothing
of
importance)
convinced
them
of
the
tragedy
of
the
incident.
Mr.
Bland,
accompanied
by
Inspector
Collins,
the
senior
detective
officer
in
the
service
of
the
company,
went
down
to
Kenyon
Junction
the
same
evening,
and
their
research
lasted
throughout
the
following
day,
but
was
attended
with
purely
negative
results.
Not
only
was
no
trace
found
of
the
missing
train,
but
no
conjecture
could
be
put
forward
which
could
possibly
explain
the
facts.
At
the
same
time,
Inspector
Collins's
official
report
(which
lies
before
me
as
I
write)
served
to
show
that
the
possibilities
were
more
numerous
than
might
have
been
expected.
"In
the
stretch
of
railway
between
these
two
points,"
said
he,
"the
country
is
dotted
with
ironworks
and
collieries.
Of
these,
some
are
being
worked
and
some
have
been
abandoned.
There
are
no
fewer
than
twelve
which
have
small
gauge
lines
which
run
trolly
cars
down
to
the
main
line.
These
can,
of
course,
