I
had
waited,
now
that
it
had
actually
come
I
was
unprepared
for
the
shock.
I
lay
motionless
and
breathless,
whilst
the
great
dark
mass
whisked
by
me
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
night.
But
now
I
nerved
myself
for
its
return.
No
sound
came
from
the
sleeping
countryside
to
tell
of
the
horror
which
was
loose.
In
no
way
could
I
judge
how
far
off
it
was,
what
it
was
doing,
or
when
it
might
be
back.
But
not
a
second
time
should
my
nerve
fail
me,
not
a
second
time
should
it
pass
unchallenged.
I
swore
it
between
my
clenched
teeth
as
I
laid
my
cocked
rifle
across
the
rock.
And
yet
it
nearly
happened.
There
was
no
warning
of
approach
now
as
the
creature
passed
over
the
grass.
Suddenly,
like
a
dark,
drifting
shadow,
the
huge
bulk
loomed
up
once
more
before
me,
making
for
the
entrance
of
the
cave.
Again
came
that
paralysis
of
volition
which
held
my
crooked
forefinger
impotent
upon
the
trigger.
But
with
a
desperate
effort
I
shook
it
off.
Even
as
the
brushwood
rustled,
and
the
monstrous
beast
blended
with
the
shadow
of
the
Gap,
I
fired
at
the
retreating
form.
In
the
blaze
of
the
gun
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
great
shaggy
mass,
something
with
rough
and
bristling
hair
of
a
withered
grey
colour,
fading
away
to
white
in
its
lower
parts,
the
huge
body
supported
upon
short,
thick,
curving
legs.
I
had
just
that
glance,
and
then
I
heard
the
rattle
of
the
stones
as
the
creature
tore
down
into
its
burrow.
In
an
instant,
with
a
triumphant
revulsion
of
feeling,
I
had
cast
my
fears
to
the
wind,
and
uncovering
my
powerful
lantern,
with
my
rifle
in
my
hand,
I
sprang
down
from
my
rock
and
rushed
after
the
monster
down
the
old
Roman
shaft.
My
splendid
lamp
cast
a
brilliant
flood
of
vivid
light
in
front
of
me,
very
different
from
the
yellow
glimmer
which
had
aided
me
down
the
same
passage
only
twelve
days
before.
As
I
ran,
I
saw
the
great
beast
lurching
along
before
me,
its
huge
bulk
filling
up
the
whole
space
from
wall
to
wall.
Its
hair
looked
like
coarse
faded
oakum,
and
hung
down
in
long,
dense
masses
which
swayed
as
it
moved.
It
was
like
an
enormous
unclipped
sheep
in
its
fleece,
but
in
size
it
was
far
larger
than
the
largest
elephant,
and
its
breadth
seemed
to
be
nearly
as
great
as
its
height.
It
fills
me
with
amazement
now
to
think
that
I
should
have
dared
to
follow
such
a
horror
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth,
but
when
one's
blood
is
up,
and
when
one's
quarry
seems
to
be
flying,
the
old
primeval
hunting
spirit
awakes
and
prudence
is
cast
to
the
wind.
Rifle
in
hand,
I
ran
at
the
top
of
my
speed
upon
the
trail
of
the
monster.
I
had
seen
that
the
creature
was
swift.
Now
I
was
to
find
out
to
