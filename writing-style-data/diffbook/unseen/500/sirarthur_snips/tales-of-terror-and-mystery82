the
London
and
West
Coast
terminus
in
London.
We
prepared
six
plans,
each
more
elaborate
than
the
last;
which
plan
would
be
used
would
depend
upon
his
own
movements.
Do
what
he
would,
we
were
ready
for
him.
If
he
had
stayed
in
Liverpool,
we
were
ready.
If
he
took
an
ordinary
train,
an
express,
or
a
special,
all
was
ready.
Everything
had
been
foreseen
and
provided
for.
"You
may
imagine
that
I
could
not
do
all
this
myself.
What
could
I
know
of
the
English
railway
lines?
But
money
can
procure
willing
agents
all
the
world
over,
and
I
soon
had
one
of
the
acutest
brains
in
England
to
assist
me.
I
will
mention
no
names,
but
it
would
be
unjust
to
claim
all
the
credit
for
myself.
My
English
ally
was
worthy
of
such
an
alliance.
He
knew
the
London
and
West
Coast
line
thoroughly,
and
he
had
the
command
of
a
band
of
workers
who
were
trustworthy
and
intelligent.
The
idea
was
his,
and
my
own
judgement
was
only
required
in
the
details.
We
bought
over
several
officials,
amongst
whom
the
most
important
was
James
McPherson,
whom
we
had
ascertained
to
be
the
guard
most
likely
to
be
employed
upon
a
special
train.
Smith,
the
stoker,
was
also
in
our
employ.
John
Slater,
the
engine
driver,
had
been
approached,
but
had
been
found
to
be
obstinate
and
dangerous,
so
we
desisted.
We
had
no
certainty
that
Monsieur
Caratal
would
take
a
special,
but
we
thought
it
very
probable,
for
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
him
that
he
should
reach
Paris
without
delay.
It
was
for
this
contingency,
therefore,
that
we
made
special
preparations
preparations
which
were
complete
down
to
the
last
detail
long
before
his
steamer
had
sighted
the
shores
of
England.
You
will
be
amused
to
learn
that
there
was
one
of
my
agents
in
the
pilot
boat
which
brought
that
steamer
to
its
moorings.
"The
moment
that
Caratal
arrived
in
Liverpool
we
knew
that
he
suspected
danger
and
was
on
his
guard.
He
had
brought
with
him
as
an
escort
a
dangerous
fellow,
named
Gomez,
a
man
who
carried
weapons,
and
was
prepared
to
use
them.
This
fellow
carried
Caratal's
confidential
papers
for
him,
and
was
ready
to
protect
either
them
or
his
master.
The
probability
was
that
Caratal
had
taken
him
into
his
counsel,
and
that
to
remove
Caratal
without
removing
Gomez
would
be
a
mere
waste
of
energy.
It
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
involved
in
a
common
fate,
and
our
plans
to
that
end
were
much
facilitated
by
their
request
for
a
special
train.
On
that
special
train
you
will
understand
that
two
out
of
the
three
servants
of
the
company
were
really
in
our
employ,
at
a
price
which
would
make
them
independent
for
a
lifetime.
I
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
English
are
more
honest
than
any
other
nation,
but
I
have
found
them
more
expensive
to
buy.
"I
have
already
spoken
