towards
me.
His
hatred
rose
to
the
height
of
a
mania.
I
had
been
rolling
in
money
in
England,
according
to
his
account,
while
he
had
been
starving
in
South
America.
I
cannot
describe
to
you
the
threats
which
he
uttered
or
the
insults
which
he
poured
upon
me.
My
impression
is,
that
hardships
and
debauchery
had
unhinged
his
reason.
He
paced
about
the
room
like
a
wild
beast,
demanding
drink,
demanding
money,
and
all
in
the
foulest
language.
I
am
a
hot
tempered
man,
but
I
thank
God
that
I
am
able
to
say
that
I
remained
master
of
myself,
and
that
I
never
raised
a
hand
against
him.
My
coolness
only
irritated
him
the
more.
He
raved,
he
cursed,
he
shook
his
fists
in
my
face,
and
then
suddenly
a
horrible
spasm
passed
over
his
features,
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
side,
and
with
a
loud
cry
he
fell
in
a
heap
at
my
feet.
I
raised
him
up
and
stretched
him
upon
the
sofa,
but
no
answer
came
to
my
exclamations,
and
the
hand
which
I
held
in
mine
was
cold
and
clammy.
His
diseased
heart
had
broken
down.
His
own
violence
had
killed
him.
"For
a
long
time
I
sat
as
if
I
were
in
some
dreadful
dream,
staring
at
the
body
of
my
brother.
I
was
aroused
by
the
knocking
of
Mrs.
Woods,
who
had
been
disturbed
by
that
dying
cry.
I
sent
her
away
to
bed.
Shortly
afterwards
a
patient
tapped
at
the
surgery
door,
but
as
I
took
no
notice,
he
or
she
went
off
again.
Slowly
and
gradually
as
I
sat
there
a
plan
was
forming
itself
in
my
head
in
the
curious
automatic
way
in
which
plans
do
form.
When
I
rose
from
my
chair
my
future
movements
were
finally
decided
upon
without
my
having
been
conscious
of
any
process
of
thought.
It
was
an
instinct
which
irresistibly
inclined
me
towards
one
course.
"Ever
since
that
change
in
my
affairs
to
which
I
have
alluded,
Bishop's
Crossing
had
become
hateful
to
me.
My
plans
of
life
had
been
ruined,
and
I
had
met
with
hasty
judgments
and
unkind
treatment
where
I
had
expected
sympathy.
It
is
true
that
any
danger
of
scandal
from
my
brother
had
passed
away
with
his
life;
but
still,
I
was
sore
about
the
past,
and
felt
that
things
could
never
be
as
they
had
been.
It
may
be
that
I
was
unduly
sensitive,
and
that
I
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
others,
but
my
feelings
were
as
I
describe.
Any
chance
of
getting
away
from
Bishop's
Crossing
and
of
everyone
in
it
would
be
most
welcome
to
me.
And
here
was
such
a
chance
as
I
could
never
have
dared
to
hope
for,
a
chance
which
would
enable
me
to
make
a
clean
break
with
the
past.
"There
was
this
dead
man
lying
upon
the
sofa,
so
like
me
that
save
for
some
little
thickness
and
coarseness
of
the
features
there
was
no
difference
