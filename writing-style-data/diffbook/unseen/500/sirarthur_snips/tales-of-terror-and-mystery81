the
greatest
men
in
France
as
these
ninepins
and
then
this
Monsieur
Caratal
was
the
ball
which
could
be
seen
coming
from
far
away.
If
he
arrived,
then
it
was
pop,
pop,
pop
for
all
of
them.
It
was
determined
that
he
should
not
arrive.
"I
do
not
accuse
them
all
of
being
conscious
of
what
was
to
happen.
There
were,
as
I
have
said,
great
financial
as
well
as
political
interests
at
stake,
and
a
syndicate
was
formed
to
manage
the
business.
Some
subscribed
to
the
syndicate
who
hardly
understood
what
were
its
objects.
But
others
understood
very
well,
and
they
can
rely
upon
it
that
I
have
not
forgotten
their
names.
They
had
ample
warning
that
Monsieur
Caratal
was
coming
long
before
he
left
South
America,
and
they
knew
that
the
evidence
which
he
held
would
certainly
mean
ruin
to
all
of
them.
The
syndicate
had
the
command
of
an
unlimited
amount
of
money
absolutely
unlimited,
you
understand.
They
looked
round
for
an
agent
who
was
capable
of
wielding
this
gigantic
power.
The
man
chosen
must
be
inventive,
resolute,
adaptive
a
man
in
a
million.
They
chose
Herbert
de
Lernac,
and
I
admit
that
they
were
right.
"My
duties
were
to
choose
my
subordinates,
to
use
freely
the
power
which
money
gives,
and
to
make
certain
that
Monsieur
Caratal
should
never
arrive
in
Paris.
With
characteristic
energy
I
set
about
my
commission
within
an
hour
of
receiving
my
instructions,
and
the
steps
which
I
took
were
the
very
best
for
the
purpose
which
could
possibly
be
devised.
"A
man
whom
I
could
trust
was
dispatched
instantly
to
South
America
to
travel
home
with
Monsieur
Caratal.
Had
he
arrived
in
time
the
ship
would
never
have
reached
Liverpool;
but
alas!
it
had
already
started
before
my
agent
could
reach
it.
I
fitted
out
a
small
armed
brig
to
intercept
it,
but
again
I
was
unfortunate.
Like
all
great
organizers
I
was,
however,
prepared
for
failure,
and
had
a
series
of
alternatives
prepared,
one
or
the
other
of
which
must
succeed.
You
must
not
underrate
the
difficulties
of
my
undertaking,
or
imagine
that
a
mere
commonplace
assassination
would
meet
the
case.
We
must
destroy
not
only
Monsieur
Caratal,
but
Monsieur
Caratal's
documents,
and
Monsieur
Caratal's
companions
also,
if
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
communicated
his
secrets
to
them.
And
you
must
remember
that
they
were
on
the
alert,
and
keenly
suspicious
of
any
such
attempt.
It
was
a
task
which
was
in
every
way
worthy
of
me,
for
I
am
always
most
masterful
where
another
would
be
appalled.
"I
was
all
ready
for
Monsieur
Caratal's
reception
in
Liverpool,
and
I
was
the
more
eager
because
I
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
made
arrangements
by
which
he
would
have
a
considerable
guard
from
the
moment
that
he
arrived
in
London.
Anything
which
was
to
be
done
must
be
done
between
the
moment
of
his
setting
foot
upon
the
Liverpool
quay
and
that
of
his
arrival
at
