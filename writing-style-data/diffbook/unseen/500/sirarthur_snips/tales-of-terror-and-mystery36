wanting
in
spirit.
Did
he
know
his
lady's
ways
and
condone
them,
or
was
he
a
mere
blind,
doting
fool?
It
was
a
point
to
be
discussed
over
the
teacups
in
snug
little
drawing
rooms,
or
with
the
aid
of
a
cigar
in
the
bow
windows
of
clubs.
Bitter
and
plain
were
the
comments
among
men
upon
his
conduct.
There
was
but
one
who
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
him,
and
he
was
the
most
silent
member
in
the
smoking
room.
He
had
seen
him
break
in
a
horse
at
the
University,
and
it
seemed
to
have
left
an
impression
upon
his
mind.
But
when
Douglas
Stone
became
the
favourite
all
doubts
as
to
Lord
Sannox's
knowledge
or
ignorance
were
set
for
ever
at
rest.
There
was
no
subterfuge
about
Stone.
In
his
high
handed,
impetuous
fashion,
he
set
all
caution
and
discretion
at
defiance.
The
scandal
became
notorious.
A
learned
body
intimated
that
his
name
had
been
struck
from
the
list
of
its
vice
presidents.
Two
friends
implored
him
to
consider
his
professional
credit.
He
cursed
them
all
three,
and
spent
forty
guineas
on
a
bangle
to
take
with
him
to
the
lady.
He
was
at
her
house
every
evening,
and
she
drove
in
his
carriage
in
the
afternoons.
There
was
not
an
attempt
on
either
side
to
conceal
their
relations;
but
there
came
at
last
a
little
incident
to
interrupt
them.
It
was
a
dismal
winter's
night,
very
cold
and
gusty,
with
the
wind
whooping
in
the
chimneys
and
blustering
against
the
window
panes.
A
thin
spatter
of
rain
tinkled
on
the
glass
with
each
fresh
sough
of
the
gale,
drowning
for
the
instant
the
dull
gurgle
and
drip
from
the
eaves.
Douglas
Stone
had
finished
his
dinner,
and
sat
by
his
fire
in
the
study,
a
glass
of
rich
port
upon
the
malachite
table
at
his
elbow.
As
he
raised
it
to
his
lips,
he
held
it
up
against
the
lamplight,
and
watched
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
the
tiny
scales
of
beeswing
which
floated
in
its
rich
ruby
depths.
The
fire,
as
it
spurted
up,
threw
fitful
lights
upon
his
bald,
clear
cut
face,
with
its
widely
opened
grey
eyes,
its
thick
and
yet
firm
lips,
and
the
deep,
square
jaw,
which
had
something
Roman
in
its
strength
and
its
animalism.
He
smiled
from
time
to
time
as
he
nestled
back
in
his
luxurious
chair.
Indeed,
he
had
a
right
to
feel
well
pleased,
for,
against
the
advice
of
six
colleagues,
he
had
performed
an
operation
that
day
of
which
only
two
cases
were
on
record,
and
the
result
had
been
brilliant
beyond
all
expectation.
No
other
man
in
London
would
have
had
the
daring
to
plan,
or
the
skill
to
execute,
such
a
heroic
measure.
But
he
had
promised
Lady
Sannox
to
see
her
that
evening
and
it
was
already
half
past
eight.
His
hand
was
outstretched
to
the
bell
to
order
the
carriage
when
he
heard
the
dull
thud
of
the
