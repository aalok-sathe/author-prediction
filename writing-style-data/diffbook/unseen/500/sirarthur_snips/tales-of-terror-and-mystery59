told
me
was
specially
prepared
upon
his
own
plantation,
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
driver's
eulogies
were
justified,
and
that
I
had
never
met
a
more
large
hearted
and
hospitable
man.
But,
in
spite
of
his
cheery
good
nature,
he
was
a
man
with
a
strong
will
and
a
fiery
temper
of
his
own.
Of
this
I
had
an
example
upon
the
following
morning.
The
curious
aversion
which
Mrs.
Everard
King
had
conceived
towards
me
was
so
strong,
that
her
manner
at
breakfast
was
almost
offensive.
But
her
meaning
became
unmistakable
when
her
husband
had
quitted
the
room.
"The
best
train
in
the
day
is
at
twelve
fifteen,"
said
she.
"But
I
was
not
thinking
of
going
today,"
I
answered,
frankly
perhaps
even
defiantly,
for
I
was
determined
not
to
be
driven
out
by
this
woman.
"Oh,
if
it
rests
with
you
"
said
she,
and
stopped
with
a
most
insolent
expression
in
her
eyes.
"I
am
sure,"
I
answered,
"that
Mr.
Everard
King
would
tell
me
if
I
were
outstaying
my
welcome."
"What's
this?
What's
this?"
said
a
voice,
and
there
he
was
in
the
room.
He
had
overheard
my
last
words,
and
a
glance
at
our
faces
had
told
him
the
rest.
In
an
instant
his
chubby,
cheery
face
set
into
an
expression
of
absolute
ferocity.
"Might
I
trouble
you
to
walk
outside,
Marshall?"
said
he.
(I
may
mention
that
my
own
name
is
Marshall
King.)
He
closed
the
door
behind
me,
and
then,
for
an
instant,
I
heard
him
talking
in
a
low
voice
of
concentrated
passion
to
his
wife.
This
gross
breach
of
hospitality
had
evidently
hit
upon
his
tenderest
point.
I
am
no
eavesdropper,
so
I
walked
out
on
to
the
lawn.
Presently
I
heard
a
hurried
step
behind
me,
and
there
was
the
lady,
her
face
pale
with
excitement,
and
her
eyes
red
with
tears.
"My
husband
has
asked
me
to
apologize
to
you,
Mr.
Marshall
King,"
said
she,
standing
with
downcast
eyes
before
me.
"Please
do
not
say
another
word,
Mrs.
King."
Her
dark
eyes
suddenly
blazed
out
at
me.
"You
fool!"
she
hissed,
with
frantic
vehemence,
and
turning
on
her
heel
swept
back
to
the
house.
The
insult
was
so
outrageous,
so
insufferable,
that
I
could
only
stand
staring
after
her
in
bewilderment.
I
was
still
there
when
my
host
joined
me.
He
was
his
cheery,
chubby
self
once
more.
"I
hope
that
my
wife
has
apologized
for
her
foolish
remarks,"
said
he.
"Oh,
yes
yes,
certainly!"
He
put
his
hand
through
my
arm
and
walked
with
me
up
and
down
the
lawn.
"You
must
not
take
it
seriously,"
said
he.
"It
would
grieve
me
inexpressibly
if
you
curtailed
your
visit
by
one
hour.
The
fact
is
there
is
no
reason
why
there
should
be
any
concealment
between
relatives
that
my
poor
dear
wife
is
incredibly
jealous.
She
hates
that
anyone
male
or
female
should
for
an
instant
come
between
us.
Her
ideal
is
a
desert
island
and
an
eternal
