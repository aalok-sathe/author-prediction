business."
A
door
opened
out
of
the
passage
which
was
the
private
entrance
from
his
rooms
into
the
museum.
This
he
opened
softly
with
his
key,
having
first
kicked
off
his
shoes,
an
example
which
I
followed.
We
crept
together
through
room
after
room,
until
the
large
hall
lay
before
us,
with
that
dark
figure
still
stooping
and
working
at
the
central
case.
With
an
advance
as
cautious
as
his
own
we
closed
in
upon
him,
but
softly
as
we
went
we
could
not
take
him
entirely
unawares.
We
were
still
a
dozen
yards
from
him
when
he
looked
round
with
a
start,
and
uttering
a
husky
cry
of
terror,
ran
frantically
down
the
museum.
"Simpson!
Simpson!"
roared
Mortimer,
and
far
away
down
the
vista
of
electric
lighted
doors
we
saw
the
stiff
figure
of
the
old
soldier
suddenly
appear.
Professor
Andreas
saw
him
also,
and
stopped
running,
with
a
gesture
of
despair.
At
the
same
instant
we
each
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder.
"Yes,
yes,
gentlemen,"
he
panted,
"I
will
come
with
you.
To
your
room,
Mr.
Ward
Mortimer,
if
you
please!
I
feel
that
I
owe
you
an
explanation."
My
companion's
indignation
was
so
great
that
I
could
see
that
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
reply.
We
walked
on
each
side
of
the
old
Professor,
the
astonished
commissionaire
bringing
up
the
rear.
When
we
reached
the
violated
case,
Mortimer
stopped
and
examined
the
breastplate.
Already
one
of
the
stones
of
the
lower
row
had
had
its
setting
turned
back
in
the
same
manner
as
the
others.
My
friend
held
it
up
and
glanced
furiously
at
his
prisoner.
"How
could
you!"
he
cried.
"How
could
you!"
"It
is
horrible
horrible!"
said
the
Professor.
"I
don't
wonder
at
your
feelings.
Take
me
to
your
room."
"But
this
shall
not
be
left
exposed!"
cried
Mortimer.
He
picked
the
breastplate
up
and
carried
it
tenderly
in
his
hand,
while
I
walked
beside
the
Professor,
like
a
policeman
with
a
malefactor.
We
passed
into
Mortimer's
chambers,
leaving
the
amazed
old
soldier
to
understand
matters
as
best
he
could.
The
Professor
sat
down
in
Mortimer's
arm
chair,
and
turned
so
ghastly
a
colour
that
for
the
instant
all
our
resentment
was
changed
to
concern.
A
stiff
glass
of
brandy
brought
the
life
back
to
him
once
more.
"There,
I
am
better
now!"
said
he.
"These
last
few
days
have
been
too
much
for
me.
I
am
convinced
that
I
could
not
stand
it
any
longer.
It
is
a
nightmare
a
horrible
nightmare
that
I
should
be
arrested
as
a
burglar
in
what
has
been
for
so
long
my
own
museum.
And
yet
I
cannot
blame
you.
You
could
not
have
done
otherwise.
My
hope
always
was
that
I
should
get
it
all
over
before
I
was
detected.
This
would
have
been
my
last
night's
work."
"How
did
you
get
in?"
asked
Mortimer.
"By
taking
a
very
great
liberty
with
your
private
door.
But
the
object
justified
it.
The
object
justified
everything.
You
