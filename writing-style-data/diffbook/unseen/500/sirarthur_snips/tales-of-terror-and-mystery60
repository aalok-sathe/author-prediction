tete
a
tete.
That
gives
you
the
clue
to
her
actions,
which
are,
I
confess,
upon
this
particular
point,
not
very
far
removed
from
mania.
Tell
me
that
you
will
think
no
more
of
it."
"No,
no;
certainly
not."
"Then
light
this
cigar
and
come
round
with
me
and
see
my
little
menagerie."
The
whole
afternoon
was
occupied
by
this
inspection,
which
included
all
the
birds,
beasts,
and
even
reptiles
which
he
had
imported.
Some
were
free,
some
in
cages,
a
few
actually
in
the
house.
He
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
his
successes
and
his
failures,
his
births
and
his
deaths,
and
he
would
cry
out
in
his
delight,
like
a
schoolboy,
when,
as
we
walked,
some
gaudy
bird
would
flutter
up
from
the
grass,
or
some
curious
beast
slink
into
the
cover.
Finally
he
led
me
down
a
corridor
which
extended
from
one
wing
of
the
house.
At
the
end
of
this
there
was
a
heavy
door
with
a
sliding
shutter
in
it,
and
beside
it
there
projected
from
the
wall
an
iron
handle
attached
to
a
wheel
and
a
drum.
A
line
of
stout
bars
extended
across
the
passage.
"I
am
about
to
show
you
the
jewel
of
my
collection,"
said
he.
"There
is
only
one
other
specimen
in
Europe,
now
that
the
Rotterdam
cub
is
dead.
It
is
a
Brazilian
cat."
"But
how
does
that
differ
from
any
other
cat?"
"You
will
soon
see
that,"
said
he,
laughing.
"Will
you
kindly
draw
that
shutter
and
look
through?"
I
did
so,
and
found
that
I
was
gazing
into
a
large,
empty
room,
with
stone
flags,
and
small,
barred
windows
upon
the
farther
wall.
In
the
centre
of
this
room,
lying
in
the
middle
of
a
golden
patch
of
sunlight,
there
was
stretched
a
huge
creature,
as
large
as
a
tiger,
but
as
black
and
sleek
as
ebony.
It
was
simply
a
very
enormous
and
very
well
kept
black
cat,
and
it
cuddled
up
and
basked
in
that
yellow
pool
of
light
exactly
as
a
cat
would
do.
It
was
so
graceful,
so
sinewy,
and
so
gently
and
smoothly
diabolical,
that
I
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
opening.
"Isn't
he
splendid?"
said
my
host,
enthusiastically.
"Glorious!
I
never
saw
such
a
noble
creature."
"Some
people
call
it
a
black
puma,
but
really
it
is
not
a
puma
at
all.
That
fellow
is
nearly
eleven
feet
from
tail
to
tip.
Four
years
ago
he
was
a
little
ball
of
black
fluff,
with
two
yellow
eyes
staring
out
of
it.
He
was
sold
me
as
a
new
born
cub
up
in
the
wild
country
at
the
head
waters
of
the
Rio
Negro.
They
speared
his
mother
to
death
after
she
had
killed
a
dozen
of
them."
"They
are
ferocious,
then?"
"The
most
absolutely
treacherous
and
bloodthirsty
creatures
upon
earth.
You
talk
about
a
Brazilian
cat
to
an
up
country
Indian,
and
see
him
get
the
jumps.
They
prefer
humans
to
game.
This
fellow
has
never
tasted
living
blood
yet,
