at
fifty
miles
an
hour,
had
flashed
past
it.
So
perished
the
only
satisfying
explanation,
and
five
years
have
elapsed
without
supplying
a
new
one.
Now,
at
last,
there
comes
a
statement
which
covers
all
the
facts,
and
which
must
be
regarded
as
authentic.
It
took
the
shape
of
a
letter
dated
from
New
York,
and
addressed
to
the
same
criminal
investigator
whose
theory
I
have
quoted.
It
is
given
here
in
extenso,
with
the
exception
of
the
two
opening
paragraphs,
which
are
personal
in
their
nature:
"You'll
excuse
me
if
I'm
not
very
free
with
names.
There's
less
reason
now
than
there
was
five
years
ago
when
mother
was
still
living.
But
for
all
that,
I
had
rather
cover
up
our
tracks
all
I
can.
But
I
owe
you
an
explanation,
for
if
your
idea
of
it
was
wrong,
it
was
a
mighty
ingenious
one
all
the
same.
I'll
have
to
go
back
a
little
so
as
you
may
understand
all
about
it.
"My
people
came
from
Bucks,
England,
and
emigrated
to
the
States
in
the
early
fifties.
They
settled
in
Rochester,
in
the
State
of
New
York,
where
my
father
ran
a
large
dry
goods
store.
There
were
only
two
sons:
myself,
James,
and
my
brother,
Edward.
I
was
ten
years
older
than
my
brother,
and
after
my
father
died
I
sort
of
took
the
place
of
a
father
to
him,
as
an
elder
brother
would.
He
was
a
bright,
spirited
boy,
and
just
one
of
the
most
beautiful
creatures
that
ever
lived.
But
there
was
always
a
soft
spot
in
him,
and
it
was
like
mould
in
cheese,
for
it
spread
and
spread,
and
nothing
that
you
could
do
would
stop
it.
Mother
saw
it
just
as
clearly
as
I
did,
but
she
went
on
spoiling
him
all
the
same,
for
he
had
such
a
way
with
him
that
you
could
refuse
him
nothing.
I
did
all
I
could
to
hold
him
in,
and
he
hated
me
for
my
pains.
"At
last
he
fairly
got
his
head,
and
nothing
that
we
could
do
would
stop
him.
He
got
off
into
New
York,
and
went
rapidly
from
bad
to
worse.
At
first
he
was
only
fast,
and
then
he
was
criminal;
and
then,
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
two,
he
was
one
of
the
most
notorious
young
crooks
in
the
city.
He
had
formed
a
friendship
with
Sparrow
MacCoy,
who
was
at
the
head
of
his
profession
as
a
bunco
steerer,
green
goodsman
and
general
rascal.
They
took
to
card
sharping,
and
frequented
some
of
the
best
hotels
in
New
York.
My
brother
was
an
excellent
actor
(he
might
have
made
an
honest
name
for
himself
if
he
had
chosen),
and
he
would
take
the
parts
of
a
young
Englishman
of
title,
of
a
simple
lad
from
the
West,
or
of
a
college
undergraduate,
whichever
suited
Sparrow
MacCoy's
purpose.
And
then
one
day
he
dressed
himself
as
a
girl,
and
he
carried
it
off
so
well,
