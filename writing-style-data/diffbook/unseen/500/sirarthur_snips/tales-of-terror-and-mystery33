thousand.
No
doubt
it
was
one
of
the
means
of
protection
which
the
Christians
adopted.
The
odds
are
two
thousand
to
one
against
a
man
getting
out,
even
if
he
had
a
light;
but
if
he
were
in
the
dark
it
would,
of
course,
be
far
more
difficult."
"So
I
should
think."
"And
the
darkness
is
something
dreadful.
I
tried
it
once
for
an
experiment.
Let
us
try
it
again!"
He
stooped
to
the
lantern,
and
in
an
instant
it
was
as
if
an
invisible
hand
was
squeezed
tightly
over
each
of
Kennedy's
eyes.
Never
had
he
known
what
such
darkness
was.
It
seemed
to
press
upon
him
and
to
smother
him.
It
was
a
solid
obstacle
against
which
the
body
shrank
from
advancing.
He
put
his
hands
out
to
push
it
back
from
him.
"That
will
do,
Burger,"
said
he,
"let's
have
the
light
again."
But
his
companion
began
to
laugh,
and
in
that
circular
room
the
sound
seemed
to
come
from
every
side
at
once.
"You
seem
uneasy,
friend
Kennedy,"
said
he.
"Go
on,
man,
light
the
candle!"
said
Kennedy
impatiently.
"It's
very
strange,
Kennedy,
but
I
could
not
in
the
least
tell
by
the
sound
in
which
direction
you
stand.
Could
you
tell
where
I
am?"
"No;
you
seem
to
be
on
every
side
of
me."
"If
it
were
not
for
this
string
which
I
hold
in
my
hand
I
should
not
have
a
notion
which
way
to
go."
"I
dare
say
not.
Strike
a
light,
man,
and
have
an
end
of
this
nonsense."
"Well,
Kennedy,
there
are
two
things
which
I
understand
that
you
are
very
fond
of.
The
one
is
an
adventure,
and
the
other
is
an
obstacle
to
surmount.
The
adventure
must
be
the
finding
of
your
way
out
of
this
catacomb.
The
obstacle
will
be
the
darkness
and
the
two
thousand
wrong
turns
which
make
the
way
a
little
difficult
to
find.
But
you
need
not
hurry,
for
you
have
plenty
of
time,
and
when
you
halt
for
a
rest
now
and
then,
I
should
like
you
just
to
think
of
Miss
Mary
Saunderson,
and
whether
you
treated
her
quite
fairly."
"You
devil,
what
do
you
mean?"
roared
Kennedy.
He
was
running
about
in
little
circles
and
clasping
at
the
solid
blackness
with
both
hands.
"Good
bye,"
said
the
mocking
voice,
and
it
was
already
at
some
distance.
"I
really
do
not
think,
Kennedy,
even
by
your
own
showing
that
you
did
the
right
thing
by
that
girl.
There
was
only
one
little
thing
which
you
appeared
not
to
know,
and
I
can
supply
it.
Miss
Saunderson
was
engaged
to
a
poor
ungainly
devil
of
a
student,
and
his
name
was
Julius
Burger."
There
was
a
rustle
somewhere,
the
vague
sound
of
a
foot
striking
a
stone,
and
then
there
fell
silence
upon
that
old
Christian
church
a
stagnant,
heavy
silence
which
closed
round
Kennedy
and
shut
him
in
like
water
round
a
drowning
man.
Some
two
months
afterwards
the
following
paragraph
