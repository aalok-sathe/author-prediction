then
the
cat
sprang!
It
was
so
quick,
so
sudden,
that
I
never
saw
it
happen.
I
simply
heard
the
savage
snarl,
and
in
an
instant
afterwards
the
blazing
yellow
eyes,
the
flattened
black
head
with
its
red
tongue
and
flashing
teeth,
were
within
reach
of
me.
The
impact
of
the
creature
shook
the
bars
upon
which
I
lay,
until
I
thought
(as
far
as
I
could
think
of
anything
at
such
a
moment)
that
they
were
coming
down.
The
cat
swayed
there
for
an
instant,
the
head
and
front
paws
quite
close
to
me,
the
hind
paws
clawing
to
find
a
grip
upon
the
edge
of
the
grating.
I
heard
the
claws
rasping
as
they
clung
to
the
wire
netting,
and
the
breath
of
the
beast
made
me
sick.
But
its
bound
had
been
miscalculated.
It
could
not
retain
its
position.
Slowly,
grinning
with
rage,
and
scratching
madly
at
the
bars,
it
swung
backwards
and
dropped
heavily
upon
the
floor.
With
a
growl
it
instantly
faced
round
to
me
and
crouched
for
another
spring.
I
knew
that
the
next
few
moments
would
decide
my
fate.
The
creature
had
learned
by
experience.
It
would
not
miscalculate
again.
I
must
act
promptly,
fearlessly,
if
I
were
to
have
a
chance
for
life.
In
an
instant
I
had
formed
my
plan.
Pulling
off
my
dress
coat,
I
threw
it
down
over
the
head
of
the
beast.
At
the
same
moment
I
dropped
over
the
edge,
seized
the
end
of
the
front
grating,
and
pulled
it
frantically
out
of
the
wall.
It
came
more
easily
than
I
could
have
expected.
I
rushed
across
the
room,
bearing
it
with
me;
but,
as
I
rushed,
the
accident
of
my
position
put
me
upon
the
outer
side.
Had
it
been
the
other
way,
I
might
have
come
off
scathless.
As
it
was,
there
was
a
moment's
pause
as
I
stopped
it
and
tried
to
pass
in
through
the
opening
which
I
had
left.
That
moment
was
enough
to
give
time
to
the
creature
to
toss
off
the
coat
with
which
I
had
blinded
him
and
to
spring
upon
me.
I
hurled
myself
through
the
gap
and
pulled
the
rails
to
behind
me,
but
he
seized
my
leg
before
I
could
entirely
withdraw
it.
One
stroke
of
that
huge
paw
tore
off
my
calf
as
a
shaving
of
wood
curls
off
before
a
plane.
The
next
moment,
bleeding
and
fainting,
I
was
lying
among
the
foul
straw
with
a
line
of
friendly
bars
between
me
and
the
creature
which
ramped
so
frantically
against
them.
Too
wounded
to
move,
and
too
faint
to
be
conscious
of
fear,
I
could
only
lie,
more
dead
than
alive,
and
watch
it.
It
pressed
its
broad,
black
chest
against
the
bars
and
angled
for
me
with
its
crooked
paws
as
I
have
seen
a
kitten
do
before
a
mouse
trap.
It
ripped
my
clothes,
but,
stretch
as
it
would,
it
could
not
quite
reach
me.
I
have
heard
of
the
curious
numbing
