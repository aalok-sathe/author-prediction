burning
in
the
study,
but
having
knocked
several
times
at
the
surgery
door
without
response,
she
concluded
that
the
doctor
had
been
called
out,
and
so
returned
home.
There
is
a
short,
winding
drive
with
a
lamp
at
the
end
of
it
leading
down
from
the
house
to
the
road.
As
Mrs.
Madding
emerged
from
the
gate
a
man
was
coming
along
the
footpath.
Thinking
that
it
might
be
Dr.
Lana
returning
from
some
professional
visit,
she
waited
for
him,
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
Mr.
Arthur
Morton,
the
young
squire.
In
the
light
of
the
lamp
she
observed
that
his
manner
was
excited,
and
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
heavy
hunting
crop.
He
was
turning
in
at
the
gate
when
she
addressed
him.
"The
doctor
is
not
in,
sir,"
said
she.
"How
do
you
know
that?"
he
asked
harshly.
"I
have
been
to
the
surgery
door,
sir."
"I
see
a
light,"
said
the
young
squire,
looking
up
the
drive.
"That
is
in
his
study,
is
it
not?"
"Yes,
sir;
but
I
am
sure
that
he
is
out."
"Well,
he
must
come
in
again,"
said
young
Morton,
and
passed
through
the
gate
while
Mrs.
Madding
went
upon
her
homeward
way.
At
three
o'clock
that
morning
her
husband
suffered
a
sharp
relapse,
and
she
was
so
alarmed
by
his
symptoms
that
she
determined
to
call
the
doctor
without
delay.
As
she
passed
through
the
gate
she
was
surprised
to
see
someone
lurking
among
the
laurel
bushes.
It
was
certainly
a
man,
and
to
the
best
of
her
belief
Mr.
Arthur
Morton.
Preoccupied
with
her
own
troubles,
she
gave
no
particular
attention
to
the
incident,
but
hurried
on
upon
her
errand.
When
she
reached
the
house
she
perceived
to
her
surprise
that
the
light
was
still
burning
in
the
study.
She
therefore
tapped
at
the
surgery
door.
There
was
no
answer.
She
repeated
the
knocking
several
times
without
effect.
It
appeared
to
her
to
be
unlikely
that
the
doctor
would
either
go
to
bed
or
go
out
leaving
so
brilliant
a
light
behind
him,
and
it
struck
Mrs.
Madding
that
it
was
possible
that
he
might
have
dropped
asleep
in
his
chair.
She
tapped
at
the
study
window,
therefore,
but
without
result.
Then,
finding
that
there
was
an
opening
between
the
curtain
and
the
woodwork,
she
looked
through.
The
small
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
from
a
large
lamp
on
the
central
table,
which
was
littered
with
the
doctor's
books
and
instruments.
No
one
was
visible,
nor
did
she
see
anything
unusual,
except
that
in
the
farther
shadow
thrown
by
the
table
a
dingy
white
glove
was
lying
upon
the
carpet.
And
then
suddenly,
as
her
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
light,
a
boot
emerged
from
the
other
end
of
the
shadow,
and
she
realized,
with
a
thrill
of
horror,
that
what
she
had
taken
to
be
a
glove
was
the
hand
of
a
man,
who
was
prostrate
upon
the
floor.
Understanding
that
something
terrible
had
occurred,
