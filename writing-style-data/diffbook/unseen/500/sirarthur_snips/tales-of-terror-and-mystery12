semi
solid
mass
in
the
rarefied
air.
The
creature
moved
swiftly
along,
keeping
pace
easily
with
the
monoplane,
and
for
twenty
miles
or
more
it
formed
my
horrible
escort,
hovering
over
me
like
a
bird
of
prey
which
is
waiting
to
pounce.
Its
method
of
progression
done
so
swiftly
that
it
was
not
easy
to
follow
was
to
throw
out
a
long,
glutinous
streamer
in
front
of
it,
which
in
turn
seemed
to
draw
forward
the
rest
of
the
writhing
body.
So
elastic
and
gelatinous
was
it
that
never
for
two
successive
minutes
was
it
the
same
shape,
and
yet
each
change
made
it
more
threatening
and
loathsome
than
the
last.
"I
knew
that
it
meant
mischief.
Every
purple
flush
of
its
hideous
body
told
me
so.
The
vague,
goggling
eyes
which
were
turned
always
upon
me
were
cold
and
merciless
in
their
viscid
hatred.
I
dipped
the
nose
of
my
monoplane
downwards
to
escape
it.
As
I
did
so,
as
quick
as
a
flash
there
shot
out
a
long
tentacle
from
this
mass
of
floating
blubber,
and
it
fell
as
light
and
sinuous
as
a
whip
lash
across
the
front
of
my
machine.
There
was
a
loud
hiss
as
it
lay
for
a
moment
across
the
hot
engine,
and
it
whisked
itself
into
the
air
again,
while
the
huge,
flat
body
drew
itself
together
as
if
in
sudden
pain.
I
dipped
to
a
vol
pique,
but
again
a
tentacle
fell
over
the
monoplane
and
was
shorn
off
by
the
propeller
as
easily
as
it
might
have
cut
through
a
smoke
wreath.
A
long,
gliding,
sticky,
serpent
like
coil
came
from
behind
and
caught
me
round
the
waist,
dragging
me
out
of
the
fuselage.
I
tore
at
it,
my
fingers
sinking
into
the
smooth,
glue
like
surface,
and
for
an
instant
I
disengaged
myself,
but
only
to
be
caught
round
the
boot
by
another
coil,
which
gave
me
a
jerk
that
tilted
me
almost
on
to
my
back.
"As
I
fell
over
I
blazed
off
both
barrels
of
my
gun,
though,
indeed,
it
was
like
attacking
an
elephant
with
a
pea
shooter
to
imagine
that
any
human
weapon
could
cripple
that
mighty
bulk.
And
yet
I
aimed
better
than
I
knew,
for,
with
a
loud
report,
one
of
the
great
blisters
upon
the
creature's
back
exploded
with
the
puncture
of
the
buck
shot.
It
was
very
clear
that
my
conjecture
was
right,
and
that
these
vast,
clear
bladders
were
distended
with
some
lifting
gas,
for
in
an
instant
the
huge,
cloud
like
body
turned
sideways,
writhing
desperately
to
find
its
balance,
while
the
white
beak
snapped
and
gaped
in
horrible
fury.
But
already
I
had
shot
away
on
the
steepest
glide
that
I
dared
to
attempt,
my
engine
still
full
on,
the
flying
propeller
and
the
force
of
gravity
shooting
me
downwards
like
an
aerolite.
Far
behind
me
I
saw
a
dull,
purplish
smudge
growing
swiftly
smaller
and
merging
into
the
blue
sky
behind
it.
I
was
safe
out
of
