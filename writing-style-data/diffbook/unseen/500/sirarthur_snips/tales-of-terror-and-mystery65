farther
end.
With
a
scream
I
seized
the
last
bar
with
my
hands
and
pulled
with
the
strength
of
a
madman.
I
WAS
a
madman
with
rage
and
horror.
For
a
minute
or
more
I
held
the
thing
motionless.
I
knew
that
he
was
straining
with
all
his
force
upon
the
handle,
and
that
the
leverage
was
sure
to
overcome
me.
I
gave
inch
by
inch,
my
feet
sliding
along
the
stones,
and
all
the
time
I
begged
and
prayed
this
inhuman
monster
to
save
me
from
this
horrible
death.
I
conjured
him
by
his
kinship.
I
reminded
him
that
I
was
his
guest;
I
begged
to
know
what
harm
I
had
ever
done
him.
His
only
answers
were
the
tugs
and
jerks
upon
the
handle,
each
of
which,
in
spite
of
all
my
struggles,
pulled
another
bar
through
the
opening.
Clinging
and
clutching,
I
was
dragged
across
the
whole
front
of
the
cage,
until
at
last,
with
aching
wrists
and
lacerated
fingers,
I
gave
up
the
hopeless
struggle.
The
grating
clanged
back
as
I
released
it,
and
an
instant
later
I
heard
the
shuffle
of
the
Turkish
slippers
in
the
passage,
and
the
slam
of
the
distant
door.
Then
everything
was
silent.
The
creature
had
never
moved
during
this
time.
He
lay
still
in
the
corner,
and
his
tail
had
ceased
switching.
This
apparition
of
a
man
adhering
to
his
bars
and
dragged
screaming
across
him
had
apparently
filled
him
with
amazement.
I
saw
his
great
eyes
staring
steadily
at
me.
I
had
dropped
the
lantern
when
I
seized
the
bars,
but
it
still
burned
upon
the
floor,
and
I
made
a
movement
to
grasp
it,
with
some
idea
that
its
light
might
protect
me.
But
the
instant
I
moved,
the
beast
gave
a
deep
and
menacing
growl.
I
stopped
and
stood
still,
quivering
with
fear
in
every
limb.
The
cat
(if
one
may
call
so
fearful
a
creature
by
so
homely
a
name)
was
not
more
than
ten
feet
from
me.
The
eyes
glimmered
like
two
disks
of
phosphorus
in
the
darkness.
They
appalled
and
yet
fascinated
me.
I
could
not
take
my
own
eyes
from
them.
Nature
plays
strange
tricks
with
us
at
such
moments
of
intensity,
and
those
glimmering
lights
waxed
and
waned
with
a
steady
rise
and
fall.
Sometimes
they
seemed
to
be
tiny
points
of
extreme
brilliancy
little
electric
sparks
in
the
black
obscurity
then
they
would
widen
and
widen
until
all
that
corner
of
the
room
was
filled
with
their
shifting
and
sinister
light.
And
then
suddenly
they
went
out
altogether.
The
beast
had
closed
its
eyes.
I
do
not
know
whether
there
may
be
any
truth
in
the
old
idea
of
the
dominance
of
the
human
gaze,
or
whether
the
huge
cat
was
simply
drowsy,
but
the
fact
remains
that,
far
from
showing
any
symptom
of
attacking
me,
it
simply
rested
its
sleek,
black
head
upon
its
huge
forepaws
and
seemed
to
sleep.
I
stood,
fearing
to
move
lest
I
should
rouse
