this
air
jungle,
as
he
called
it,
existed
only
over
the
south
west
of
England,
then
it
would
seem
that
he
had
fled
from
it
at
the
full
speed
of
his
monoplane,
but
had
been
overtaken
and
devoured
by
these
horrible
creatures
at
some
spot
in
the
outer
atmosphere
above
the
place
where
the
grim
relics
were
found.
The
picture
of
that
monoplane
skimming
down
the
sky,
with
the
nameless
terrors
flying
as
swiftly
beneath
it
and
cutting
it
off
always
from
the
earth
while
they
gradually
closed
in
upon
their
victim,
is
one
upon
which
a
man
who
valued
his
sanity
would
prefer
not
to
dwell.
There
are
many,
as
I
am
aware,
who
still
jeer
at
the
facts
which
I
have
here
set
down,
but
even
they
must
admit
that
Joyce
Armstrong
has
disappeared,
and
I
would
commend
to
them
his
own
words:
"This
note
book
may
explain
what
I
am
trying
to
do,
and
how
I
lost
my
life
in
doing
it.
But
no
drivel
about
accidents
or
mysteries,
if
YOU
please."
The
Leather
Funnel
My
friend,
Lionel
Dacre,
lived
in
the
Avenue
de
Wagram,
Paris.
His
house
was
that
small
one,
with
the
iron
railings
and
grass
plot
in
front
of
it,
on
the
left
hand
side
as
you
pass
down
from
the
Arc
de
Triomphe.
I
fancy
that
it
had
been
there
long
before
the
avenue
was
constructed,
for
the
grey
tiles
were
stained
with
lichens,
and
the
walls
were
mildewed
and
discoloured
with
age.
It
looked
a
small
house
from
the
street,
five
windows
in
front,
if
I
remember
right,
but
it
deepened
into
a
single
long
chamber
at
the
back.
It
was
here
that
Dacre
had
that
singular
library
of
occult
literature,
and
the
fantastic
curiosities
which
served
as
a
hobby
for
himself,
and
an
amusement
for
his
friends.
A
wealthy
man
of
refined
and
eccentric
tastes,
he
had
spent
much
of
his
life
and
fortune
in
gathering
together
what
was
said
to
be
a
unique
private
collection
of
Talmudic,
cabalistic,
and
magical
works,
many
of
them
of
great
rarity
and
value.
His
tastes
leaned
toward
the
marvellous
and
the
monstrous,
and
I
have
heard
that
his
experiments
in
the
direction
of
the
unknown
have
passed
all
the
bounds
of
civilization
and
of
decorum.
To
his
English
friends
he
never
alluded
to
such
matters,
and
took
the
tone
of
the
student
and
virtuoso;
but
a
Frenchman
whose
tastes
were
of
the
same
nature
has
assured
me
that
the
worst
excesses
of
the
black
mass
have
been
perpetrated
in
that
large
and
lofty
hall,
which
is
lined
with
the
shelves
of
his
books,
and
the
cases
of
his
museum.
Dacre's
appearance
was
enough
to
show
that
his
deep
interest
in
these
psychic
matters
was
intellectual
rather
than
spiritual.
There
was
no
trace
of
asceticism
upon
his
heavy
face,
but
there
was
much
mental
force
in
his
huge,
dome
like
skull,
which
curved
upward
from
amongst
his
thinning
locks,
like
a
snowpeak
above
its
fringe
