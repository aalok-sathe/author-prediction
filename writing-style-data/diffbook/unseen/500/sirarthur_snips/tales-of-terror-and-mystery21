black,
cruel
days
of
the
world's
history?
I
sank
my
throbbing
head
upon
my
shaking
hands.
And
then,
suddenly,
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
in
my
bosom,
and
I
could
not
even
scream,
so
great
was
my
terror.
Something
was
advancing
toward
me
through
the
darkness
of
the
room.
It
is
a
horror
coming
upon
a
horror
which
breaks
a
man's
spirit.
I
could
not
reason,
I
could
not
pray;
I
could
only
sit
like
a
frozen
image,
and
glare
at
the
dark
figure
which
was
coming
down
the
great
room.
And
then
it
moved
out
into
the
white
lane
of
moonlight,
and
I
breathed
once
more.
It
was
Dacre,
and
his
face
showed
that
he
was
as
frightened
as
myself.
"Was
that
you?
For
God's
sake
what's
the
matter?"
he
asked
in
a
husky
voice.
"Oh,
Dacre,
I
am
glad
to
see
you!
I
have
been
down
into
hell.
It
was
dreadful."
"Then
it
was
you
who
screamed?"
"I
dare
say
it
was."
"It
rang
through
the
house.
The
servants
are
all
terrified."
He
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp.
"I
think
we
may
get
the
fire
to
burn
up
again,"
he
added,
throwing
some
logs
upon
the
embers.
"Good
God,
my
dear
chap,
how
white
you
are!
You
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
ghost."
"So
I
have
several
ghosts."
"The
leather
funnel
has
acted,
then?"
"I
wouldn't
sleep
near
the
infernal
thing
again
for
all
the
money
you
could
offer
me."
Dacre
chuckled.
"I
expected
that
you
would
have
a
lively
night
of
it,"
said
he.
"You
took
it
out
of
me
in
return,
for
that
scream
of
yours
wasn't
a
very
pleasant
sound
at
two
in
the
morning.
I
suppose
from
what
you
say
that
you
have
seen
the
whole
dreadful
business."
"What
dreadful
business?"
"The
torture
of
the
water
the
'Extraordinary
Question,'
as
it
was
called
in
the
genial
days
of
'Le
Roi
Soleil.'
Did
you
stand
it
out
to
the
end?"
"No,
thank
God,
I
awoke
before
it
really
began."
"Ah!
it
is
just
as
well
for
you.
I
held
out
till
the
third
bucket.
Well,
it
is
an
old
story,
and
they
are
all
in
their
graves
now,
anyhow,
so
what
does
it
matter
how
they
got
there?
I
suppose
that
you
have
no
idea
what
it
was
that
you
have
seen?"
"The
torture
of
some
criminal.
She
must
have
been
a
terrible
malefactor
indeed
if
her
crimes
are
in
proportion
to
her
penalty."
"Well,
we
have
that
small
consolation,"
said
Dacre,
wrapping
his
dressing
gown
round
him
and
crouching
closer
to
the
fire.
"They
WERE
in
proportion
to
her
penalty.
That
is
to
say,
if
I
am
correct
in
the
lady's
identity."
"How
could
you
possibly
know
her
identity?"
For
answer
Dacre
took
down
an
old
vellum
covered
volume
from
the
shelf.
"Just
listen
to
this,"
said
he;
"it
is
in
the
French
of
the
seventeenth
century,
but
I
will
give
a
rough
translation
as
I
go.
You
will
