later
a
third,
more
bewildering
"Presume
some
mistake
as
to
proposed
running
of
special.
Local
train
from
St.
Helens
timed
to
follow
it
has
just
arrived
and
has
seen
nothing
of
it.
Kindly
wire
advices.
Manchester."
The
matter
was
assuming
a
most
amazing
aspect,
although
in
some
respects
the
last
telegram
was
a
relief
to
the
authorities
at
Liverpool.
If
an
accident
had
occurred
to
the
special,
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
the
local
train
could
have
passed
down
the
same
line
without
observing
it.
And
yet,
what
was
the
alternative?
Where
could
the
train
be?
Had
it
possibly
been
sidetracked
for
some
reason
in
order
to
allow
the
slower
train
to
go
past?
Such
an
explanation
was
possible
if
some
small
repair
had
to
be
effected.
A
telegram
was
dispatched
to
each
of
the
stations
between
St.
Helens
and
Manchester,
and
the
superintendent
and
traffic
manager
waited
in
the
utmost
suspense
at
the
instrument
for
the
series
of
replies
which
would
enable
them
to
say
for
certain
what
had
become
of
the
missing
train.
The
answers
came
back
in
the
order
of
questions,
which
was
the
order
of
the
stations
beginning
at
the
St.
Helens
end
"Special
passed
here
five
o'clock.
Collins
Green."
"Special
passed
here
six
past
five.
Earlstown."
"Special
passed
here
5:10.
Newton."
"Special
passed
here
5:20.
Kenyon
Junction."
"No
special
train
has
passed
here.
Barton
Moss."
The
two
officials
stared
at
each
other
in
amazement.
"This
is
unique
in
my
thirty
years
of
experience,"
said
Mr.
Bland.
"Absolutely
unprecedented
and
inexplicable,
sir.
The
special
has
gone
wrong
between
Kenyon
Junction
and
Barton
Moss."
"And
yet
there
is
no
siding,
so
far
as
my
memory
serves
me,
between
the
two
stations.
The
special
must
have
run
off
the
metals."
"But
how
could
the
four
fifty
parliamentary
pass
over
the
same
line
without
observing
it?"
"There's
no
alternative,
Mr.
Hood.
It
must
be
so.
Possibly
the
local
train
may
have
observed
something
which
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter.
We
will
wire
to
Manchester
for
more
information,
and
to
Kenyon
Junction
with
instructions
that
the
line
be
examined
instantly
as
far
as
Barton
Moss."
The
answer
from
Manchester
came
within
a
few
minutes.
"No
news
of
missing
special.
Driver
and
guard
of
slow
train
positive
no
accident
between
Kenyon
Junction
and
Barton
Moss.
Line
quite
clear,
and
no
sign
of
anything
unusual.
Manchester."
"That
driver
and
guard
will
have
to
go,"
said
Mr.
Bland,
grimly.
"There
has
been
a
wreck
and
they
have
missed
it.
The
special
has
obviously
run
off
the
metals
without
disturbing
the
line
how
it
could
have
done
so
passes
my
comprehension
but
so
it
must
be,
and
we
shall
have
a
wire
from
Kenyon
or
Barton
Moss
presently
to
say
that
they
have
found
her
at
the
bottom
of
an
embankment."
But
Mr.
Bland's
prophecy
was
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled.
Half
an
hour
passed,
and
then
there
arrived
the
following
message
from
the
station
master
of
Kenyon
Junction
"There
are
no
