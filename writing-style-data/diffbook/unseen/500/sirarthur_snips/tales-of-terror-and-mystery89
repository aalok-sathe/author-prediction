leaning
eagerly
forward
across
his
desk,
and
there
was
an
expression
of
something
like
anxiety
in
his
eyes.
"I
am
afraid
that
you
do
not
know
about
beetles,"
he
cried.
"On
the
contrary,
sir,
it
is
the
one
scientific
subject
about
which
I
feel
that
I
really
do
know
something."
"I
am
overjoyed
to
hear
it.
Please
talk
to
me
about
beetles."
I
talked.
I
do
not
profess
to
have
said
anything
original
upon
the
subject,
but
I
gave
a
short
sketch
of
the
characteristics
of
the
beetle,
and
ran
over
the
more
common
species,
with
some
allusions
to
the
specimens
in
my
own
little
collection
and
to
the
article
upon
"Burying
Beetles"
which
I
had
contributed
to
the
Journal
of
Entomological
Science.
"What!
not
a
collector?"
cried
Lord
Linchmere.
"You
don't
mean
that
you
are
yourself
a
collector?"
His
eyes
danced
with
pleasure
at
the
thought.
"You
are
certainly
the
very
man
in
London
for
my
purpose.
I
thought
that
among
five
millions
of
people
there
must
be
such
a
man,
but
the
difficulty
is
to
lay
one's
hands
upon
him.
I
have
been
extraordinarily
fortunate
in
finding
you."
He
rang
a
gong
upon
the
table,
and
the
footman
entered.
"Ask
Lady
Rossiter
to
have
the
goodness
to
step
this
way,"
said
his
lordship,
and
a
few
moments
later
the
lady
was
ushered
into
the
room.
She
was
a
small,
middle
aged
woman,
very
like
Lord
Linchmere
in
appearance,
with
the
same
quick,
alert
features
and
grey
black
hair.
The
expression
of
anxiety,
however,
which
I
had
observed
upon
his
face
was
very
much
more
marked
upon
hers.
Some
great
grief
seemed
to
have
cast
its
shadow
over
her
features.
As
Lord
Linchmere
presented
me
she
turned
her
face
full
upon
me,
and
I
was
shocked
to
observe
a
half
healed
scar
extending
for
two
inches
over
her
right
eyebrow.
It
was
partly
concealed
by
plaster,
but
none
the
less
I
could
see
that
it
had
been
a
serious
wound
and
not
long
inflicted.
"Dr.
Hamilton
is
the
very
man
for
our
purpose,
Evelyn,"
said
Lord
Linchmere.
"He
is
actually
a
collector
of
beetles,
and
he
has
written
articles
upon
the
subject."
"Really!"
said
Lady
Rossiter.
"Then
you
must
have
heard
of
my
husband.
Everyone
who
knows
anything
about
beetles
must
have
heard
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter."
For
the
first
time
a
thin
little
ray
of
light
began
to
break
into
the
obscure
business.
Here,
at
last,
was
a
connection
between
these
people
and
beetles.
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter
he
was
the
greatest
authority
upon
the
subject
in
the
world.
He
had
made
it
his
lifelong
study,
and
had
written
a
most
exhaustive
work
upon
it.
I
hastened
to
assure
her
that
I
had
read
and
appreciated
it.
"Have
you
met
my
husband?"
she
asked.
"No,
I
have
not."
"But
you
shall,"
said
Lord
Linchmere,
with
decision.
The
lady
was
standing
beside
the
desk,
and
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder.
It
was
obvious
to
me
as
I
saw
