And
now
the
silent
and
majestic
figure
of
my
employer
became
an
object
of
greater
interest
to
me.
I
began
to
understand
that
strangely
human
look
in
his
eyes,
those
deep
lines
upon
his
care
worn
face.
He
was
a
man
who
was
fighting
a
ceaseless
battle,
holding
at
arm's
length,
from
morning
till
night,
a
horrible
adversary
who
was
forever
trying
to
close
with
him
an
adversary
which
would
destroy
him
body
and
soul
could
it
but
fix
its
claws
once
more
upon
him.
As
I
watched
the
grim,
round
backed
figure
pacing
the
corridor
or
walking
in
the
garden,
this
imminent
danger
seemed
to
take
bodily
shape,
and
I
could
almost
fancy
that
I
saw
this
most
loathsome
and
dangerous
of
all
the
fiends
crouching
closely
in
his
very
shadow,
like
a
half
cowed
beast
which
slinks
beside
its
keeper,
ready
at
any
unguarded
moment
to
spring
at
his
throat.
And
the
dead
woman,
the
woman
who
had
spent
her
life
in
warding
off
this
danger,
took
shape
also
to
my
imagination,
and
I
saw
her
as
a
shadowy
but
beautiful
presence
which
intervened
for
ever
with
arms
uplifted
to
screen
the
man
whom
she
loved.
In
some
subtle
way
he
divined
the
sympathy
which
I
had
for
him,
and
he
showed
in
his
own
silent
fashion
that
he
appreciated
it.
He
even
invited
me
once
to
share
his
afternoon
walk,
and
although
no
word
passed
between
us
on
this
occasion,
it
was
a
mark
of
confidence
which
he
had
never
shown
to
anyone
before.
He
asked
me
also
to
index
his
library
(it
was
one
of
the
best
private
libraries
in
England),
and
I
spent
many
hours
in
the
evening
in
his
presence,
if
not
in
his
society,
he
reading
at
his
desk
and
I
sitting
in
a
recess
by
the
window
reducing
to
order
the
chaos
which
existed
among
his
books.
In
spite
of
these
close
relations
I
was
never
again
asked
to
enter
the
chamber
in
the
turret.
And
then
came
my
revulsion
of
feeling.
A
single
incident
changed
all
my
sympathy
to
loathing,
and
made
me
realize
that
my
employer
still
remained
all
that
he
had
ever
been,
with
the
additional
vice
of
hypocrisy.
What
happened
was
as
follows.
One
evening
Miss
Witherton
had
gone
down
to
Broadway,
the
neighbouring
village,
to
sing
at
a
concert
for
some
charity,
and
I,
according
to
my
promise,
had
walked
over
to
escort
her
back.
The
drive
sweeps
round
under
the
eastern
turret,
and
I
observed
as
I
passed
that
the
light
was
lit
in
the
circular
room.
It
was
a
summer
evening,
and
the
window,
which
was
a
little
higher
than
our
heads,
was
open.
We
were,
as
it
happened,
engrossed
in
our
own
conversation
at
the
moment
and
we
had
paused
upon
the
lawn
which
skirts
the
old
turret,
when
suddenly
something
broke
in
upon
our
talk
and
turned
our
thoughts
away
from
our
own
affairs.
It
was
a
voice
the
voice
undoubtedly
of
a
