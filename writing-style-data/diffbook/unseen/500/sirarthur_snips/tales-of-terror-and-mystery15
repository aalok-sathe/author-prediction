of
fir
trees.
His
knowledge
was
greater
than
his
wisdom,
and
his
powers
were
far
superior
to
his
character.
The
small
bright
eyes,
buried
deeply
in
his
fleshy
face,
twinkled
with
intelligence
and
an
unabated
curiosity
of
life,
but
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
sensualist
and
an
egotist.
Enough
of
the
man,
for
he
is
dead
now,
poor
devil,
dead
at
the
very
time
that
he
had
made
sure
that
he
had
at
last
discovered
the
elixir
of
life.
It
is
not
with
his
complex
character
that
I
have
to
deal,
but
with
the
very
strange
and
inexplicable
incident
which
had
its
rise
in
my
visit
to
him
in
the
early
spring
of
the
year
'82.
I
had
known
Dacre
in
England,
for
my
researches
in
the
Assyrian
Room
of
the
British
Museum
had
been
conducted
at
the
time
when
he
was
endeavouring
to
establish
a
mystic
and
esoteric
meaning
in
the
Babylonian
tablets,
and
this
community
of
interests
had
brought
us
together.
Chance
remarks
had
led
to
daily
conversation,
and
that
to
something
verging
upon
friendship.
I
had
promised
him
that
on
my
next
visit
to
Paris
I
would
call
upon
him.
At
the
time
when
I
was
able
to
fulfil
my
compact
I
was
living
in
a
cottage
at
Fontainebleau,
and
as
the
evening
trains
were
inconvenient,
he
asked
me
to
spend
the
night
in
his
house.
"I
have
only
that
one
spare
couch,"
said
he,
pointing
to
a
broad
sofa
in
his
large
salon;
"I
hope
that
you
will
manage
to
be
comfortable
there."
It
was
a
singular
bedroom,
with
its
high
walls
of
brown
volumes,
but
there
could
be
no
more
agreeable
furniture
to
a
bookworm
like
myself,
and
there
is
no
scent
so
pleasant
to
my
nostrils
as
that
faint,
subtle
reek
which
comes
from
an
ancient
book.
I
assured
him
that
I
could
desire
no
more
charming
chamber,
and
no
more
congenial
surroundings.
"If
the
fittings
are
neither
convenient
nor
conventional,
they
are
at
least
costly,"
said
he,
looking
round
at
his
shelves.
"I
have
expended
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
upon
these
objects
which
surround
you.
Books,
weapons,
gems,
carvings,
tapestries,
images
there
is
hardly
a
thing
here
which
has
not
its
history,
and
it
is
generally
one
worth
telling."
He
was
seated
as
he
spoke
at
one
side
of
the
open
fire
place,
and
I
at
the
other.
His
reading
table
was
on
his
right,
and
the
strong
lamp
above
it
ringed
it
with
a
very
vivid
circle
of
golden
light.
A
half
rolled
palimpsest
lay
in
the
centre,
and
around
it
were
many
quaint
articles
of
bric
a
brac.
One
of
these
was
a
large
funnel,
such
as
is
used
for
filling
wine
casks.
It
appeared
to
be
made
of
black
wood,
and
to
be
rimmed
with
discoloured
brass.
"That
is
a
curious
thing,"
I
remarked.
"What
is
the
history
of
that?"
"Ah!"
said
he,
"it
is
the
very
question
which
I
have
had
occasion
to
ask
