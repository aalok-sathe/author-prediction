is
very
clear
to
me
that
the
insensibility
which
came
upon
Glaisher,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
upon
Coxwell,
when,
in
1862,
they
ascended
in
a
balloon
to
the
height
of
thirty
thousand
feet,
was
due
to
the
extreme
speed
with
which
a
perpendicular
ascent
is
made.
Doing
it
at
an
easy
gradient
and
accustoming
oneself
to
the
lessened
barometric
pressure
by
slow
degrees,
there
are
no
such
dreadful
symptoms.
At
the
same
great
height
I
found
that
even
without
my
oxygen
inhaler
I
could
breathe
without
undue
distress.
It
was
bitterly
cold,
however,
and
my
thermometer
was
at
zero,
Fahrenheit.
At
one
thirty
I
was
nearly
seven
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
earth,
and
still
ascending
steadily.
I
found,
however,
that
the
rarefied
air
was
giving
markedly
less
support
to
my
planes,
and
that
my
angle
of
ascent
had
to
be
considerably
lowered
in
consequence.
It
was
already
clear
that
even
with
my
light
weight
and
strong
engine
power
there
was
a
point
in
front
of
me
where
I
should
be
held.
To
make
matters
worse,
one
of
my
sparking
plugs
was
in
trouble
again
and
there
was
intermittent
misfiring
in
the
engine.
My
heart
was
heavy
with
the
fear
of
failure.
"It
was
about
that
time
that
I
had
a
most
extraordinary
experience.
Something
whizzed
past
me
in
a
trail
of
smoke
and
exploded
with
a
loud,
hissing
sound,
sending
forth
a
cloud
of
steam.
For
the
instant
I
could
not
imagine
what
had
happened.
Then
I
remembered
that
the
earth
is
for
ever
being
bombarded
by
meteor
stones,
and
would
be
hardly
inhabitable
were
they
not
in
nearly
every
case
turned
to
vapour
in
the
outer
layers
of
the
atmosphere.
Here
is
a
new
danger
for
the
high
altitude
man,
for
two
others
passed
me
when
I
was
nearing
the
forty
thousand
foot
mark.
I
cannot
doubt
that
at
the
edge
of
the
earth's
envelope
the
risk
would
be
a
very
real
one.
"My
barograph
needle
marked
forty
one
thousand
three
hundred
when
I
became
aware
that
I
could
go
no
farther.
Physically,
the
strain
was
not
as
yet
greater
than
I
could
bear
but
my
machine
had
reached
its
limit.
The
attenuated
air
gave
no
firm
support
to
the
wings,
and
the
least
tilt
developed
into
side
slip,
while
she
seemed
sluggish
on
her
controls.
Possibly,
had
the
engine
been
at
its
best,
another
thousand
feet
might
have
been
within
our
capacity,
but
it
was
still
misfiring,
and
two
out
of
the
ten
cylinders
appeared
to
be
out
of
action.
If
I
had
not
already
reached
the
zone
for
which
I
was
searching
then
I
should
never
see
it
upon
this
journey.
But
was
it
not
possible
that
I
had
attained
it?
Soaring
in
circles
like
a
monstrous
hawk
upon
the
forty
thousand
foot
level
I
let
the
monoplane
guide
herself,
and
with
my
Mannheim
glass
I
made
a
careful
observation
of
my
surroundings.
The
heavens
were
perfectly
clear;
there
was
no
indication
of
those
