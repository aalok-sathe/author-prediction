his
facts
with
his
usual
skill,
and
as
the
day
wore
on,
it
became
more
and
more
evident
how
difficult
was
the
task
which
Mr.
Humphrey,
who
had
been
retained
for
the
defence,
had
before
him.
Several
witnesses
were
put
up
to
swear
to
the
intemperate
expressions
which
the
young
squire
had
been
heard
to
utter
about
the
doctor,
and
the
fiery
manner
in
which
he
resented
the
alleged
ill
treatment
of
his
sister.
Mrs.
Madding
repeated
her
evidence
as
to
the
visit
which
had
been
paid
late
at
night
by
the
prisoner
to
the
deceased,
and
it
was
shown
by
another
witness
that
the
prisoner
was
aware
that
the
doctor
was
in
the
habit
of
sitting
up
alone
in
this
isolated
wing
of
the
house,
and
that
he
had
chosen
this
very
late
hour
to
call
because
he
knew
that
his
victim
would
then
be
at
his
mercy.
A
servant
at
the
squire's
house
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
had
heard
his
master
return
about
three
that
morning,
which
corroborated
Mrs.
Madding's
statement
that
she
had
seen
him
among
the
laurel
bushes
near
the
gate
upon
the
occasion
of
her
second
visit.
The
muddy
boots
and
an
alleged
similarity
in
the
footprints
were
duly
dwelt
upon,
and
it
was
felt
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
had
been
presented
that,
however
circumstantial
it
might
be,
it
was
none
the
less
so
complete
and
so
convincing,
that
the
fate
of
the
prisoner
was
sealed,
unless
something
quite
unexpected
should
be
disclosed
by
the
defence.
It
was
three
o'clock
when
the
prosecution
closed.
At
half
past
four,
when
the
court
rose,
a
new
and
unlooked
for
development
had
occurred.
I
extract
the
incident,
or
part
of
it,
from
the
journal
which
I
have
already
mentioned,
omitting
the
preliminary
observations
of
the
counsel.
Considerable
sensation
was
caused
in
the
crowded
court
when
the
first
witness
called
for
the
defence
proved
to
be
Miss
Frances
Morton,
the
sister
of
the
prisoner.
Our
readers
will
remember
that
the
young
lady
had
been
engaged
to
Dr.
Lana,
and
that
it
was
his
anger
over
the
sudden
termination
of
this
engagement
which
was
thought
to
have
driven
her
brother
to
the
perpetration
of
this
crime.
Miss
Morton
had
not,
however,
been
directly
implicated
in
the
case
in
any
way,
either
at
the
inquest
or
at
the
police
court
proceedings,
and
her
appearance
as
the
leading
witness
for
the
defence
came
as
a
surprise
upon
the
public.
Miss
Frances
Morton,
who
was
a
tall
and
handsome
brunette,
gave
her
evidence
in
a
low
but
clear
voice,
though
it
was
evident
throughout
that
she
was
suffering
from
extreme
emotion.
She
alluded
to
her
engagement
to
the
doctor,
touched
briefly
upon
its
termination,
which
was
due,
she
said,
to
personal
matters
connected
with
his
family,
and
surprised
the
court
by
asserting
that
she
had
always
considered
her
brother's
resentment
to
be
unreasonable
and
intemperate.
In
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
her
counsel,
she
replied
that
she
did
