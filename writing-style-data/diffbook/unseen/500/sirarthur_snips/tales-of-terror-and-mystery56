at
an
early
period
of
the
world's
history,
when
communication
with
the
outer
air
was
more
easy.
This
place
had
then
developed
a
fauna
and
flora
of
its
own,
including
such
monsters
as
the
one
which
I
had
seen,
which
may
well
have
been
the
old
cave
bear,
enormously
enlarged
and
modified
by
its
new
environment.
For
countless
aeons
the
internal
and
the
external
creation
had
kept
apart,
growing
steadily
away
from
each
other.
Then
there
had
come
some
rift
in
the
depths
of
the
mountain
which
had
enabled
one
creature
to
wander
up
and,
by
means
of
the
Roman
tunnel,
to
reach
the
open
air.
Like
all
subterranean
life,
it
had
lost
the
power
of
sight,
but
this
had
no
doubt
been
compensated
for
by
nature
in
other
directions.
Certainly
it
had
some
means
of
finding
its
way
about,
and
of
hunting
down
the
sheep
upon
the
hillside.
As
to
its
choice
of
dark
nights,
it
is
part
of
my
theory
that
light
was
painful
to
those
great
white
eyeballs,
and
that
it
was
only
a
pitch
black
world
which
it
could
tolerate.
Perhaps,
indeed,
it
was
the
glare
of
my
lantern
which
saved
my
life
at
that
awful
moment
when
we
were
face
to
face.
So
I
read
the
riddle.
I
leave
these
facts
behind
me,
and
if
you
can
explain
them,
do
so;
or
if
you
choose
to
doubt
them,
do
so.
Neither
your
belief
nor
your
incredulity
can
alter
them,
nor
affect
one
whose
task
is
nearly
over.
So
ended
the
strange
narrative
of
Dr.
James
Hardcastle.
The
Brazilian
Cat
It
is
hard
luck
on
a
young
fellow
to
have
expensive
tastes,
great
expectations,
aristocratic
connections,
but
no
actual
money
in
his
pocket,
and
no
profession
by
which
he
may
earn
any.
The
fact
was
that
my
father,
a
good,
sanguine,
easy
going
man,
had
such
confidence
in
the
wealth
and
benevolence
of
his
bachelor
elder
brother,
Lord
Southerton,
that
he
took
it
for
granted
that
I,
his
only
son,
would
never
be
called
upon
to
earn
a
living
for
myself.
He
imagined
that
if
there
were
not
a
vacancy
for
me
on
the
great
Southerton
Estates,
at
least
there
would
be
found
some
post
in
that
diplomatic
service
which
still
remains
the
special
preserve
of
our
privileged
classes.
He
died
too
early
to
realize
how
false
his
calculations
had
been.
Neither
my
uncle
nor
the
State
took
the
slightest
notice
of
me,
or
showed
any
interest
in
my
career.
An
occasional
brace
of
pheasants,
or
basket
of
hares,
was
all
that
ever
reached
me
to
remind
me
that
I
was
heir
to
Otwell
House
and
one
of
the
richest
estates
in
the
country.
In
the
meantime,
I
found
myself
a
bachelor
and
man
about
town,
living
in
a
suite
of
apartments
in
Grosvenor
Mansions,
with
no
occupation
save
that
of
pigeon
shooting
and
polo
playing
at
Hurlingham.
Month
by
month
I
realized
that
it
was
more
and
more
difficult
to
get
the
brokers
to
renew
