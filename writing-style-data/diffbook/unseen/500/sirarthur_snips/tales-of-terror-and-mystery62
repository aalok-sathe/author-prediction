can't
part
with
him.
Now,
I
think
that
I
have
inflicted
my
hobby
upon
you
long
enough,
so
we
cannot
do
better
than
follow
Tommy's
example,
and
go
to
our
lunch."
My
South
American
relative
was
so
engrossed
by
his
grounds
and
their
curious
occupants,
that
I
hardly
gave
him
credit
at
first
for
having
any
interests
outside
them.
That
he
had
some,
and
pressing
ones,
was
soon
borne
in
upon
me
by
the
number
of
telegrams
which
he
received.
They
arrived
at
all
hours,
and
were
always
opened
by
him
with
the
utmost
eagerness
and
anxiety
upon
his
face.
Sometimes
I
imagined
that
it
must
be
the
Turf,
and
sometimes
the
Stock
Exchange,
but
certainly
he
had
some
very
urgent
business
going
forwards
which
was
not
transacted
upon
the
Downs
of
Suffolk.
During
the
six
days
of
my
visit
he
had
never
fewer
than
three
or
four
telegrams
a
day,
and
sometimes
as
many
as
seven
or
eight.
I
had
occupied
these
six
days
so
well,
that
by
the
end
of
them
I
had
succeeded
in
getting
upon
the
most
cordial
terms
with
my
cousin.
Every
night
we
had
sat
up
late
in
the
billiard
room,
he
telling
me
the
most
extraordinary
stories
of
his
adventures
in
America
stories
so
desperate
and
reckless,
that
I
could
hardly
associate
them
with
the
brown
little,
chubby
man
before
me.
In
return,
I
ventured
upon
some
of
my
own
reminiscences
of
London
life,
which
interested
him
so
much,
that
he
vowed
he
would
come
up
to
Grosvenor
Mansions
and
stay
with
me.
He
was
anxious
to
see
the
faster
side
of
city
life,
and
certainly,
though
I
say
it,
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
competent
guide.
It
was
not
until
the
last
day
of
my
visit
that
I
ventured
to
approach
that
which
was
on
my
mind.
I
told
him
frankly
about
my
pecuniary
difficulties
and
my
impending
ruin,
and
I
asked
his
advice
though
I
hoped
for
something
more
solid.
He
listened
attentively,
puffing
hard
at
his
cigar.
"But
surely,"
said
he,
"you
are
the
heir
of
our
relative,
Lord
Southerton?"
"I
have
every
reason
to
believe
so,
but
he
would
never
make
me
any
allowance."
"No,
no,
I
have
heard
of
his
miserly
ways.
My
poor
Marshall,
your
position
has
been
a
very
hard
one.
By
the
way,
have
you
heard
any
news
of
Lord
Southerton's
health
lately?"
"He
has
always
been
in
a
critical
condition
ever
since
my
childhood."
"Exactly
a
creaking
hinge,
if
ever
there
was
one.
Your
inheritance
may
be
a
long
way
off.
Dear
me,
how
awkwardly
situated
you
are!"
"I
had
some
hopes,
sir,
that
you,
knowing
all
the
facts,
might
be
inclined
to
advance
"
"Don't
say
another
word,
my
dear
boy,"
he
cried,
with
the
utmost
cordiality;
"we
shall
talk
it
over
tonight,
and
I
give
you
my
word
that
whatever
is
in
my
power
shall
be
done."
I
was
not
sorry
that
my
visit
was
drawing
to
a
close,
for
