detained
as
a
witness
at
Rugby.
The
carriage
which
included
the
two
compartments
in
question
was
uncoupled
and
side
tracked.
Then,
on
the
arrival
of
Inspector
Vane,
of
Scotland
Yard,
and
of
Mr.
Henderson,
a
detective
in
the
service
of
the
railway
company,
an
exhaustive
inquiry
was
made
into
all
the
circumstances.
That
crime
had
been
committed
was
certain.
The
bullet,
which
appeared
to
have
come
from
a
small
pistol
or
revolver,
had
been
fired
from
some
little
distance,
as
there
was
no
scorching
of
the
clothes.
No
weapon
was
found
in
the
compartment
(which
finally
disposed
of
the
theory
of
suicide),
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
the
brown
leather
bag
which
the
guard
had
seen
in
the
hand
of
the
tall
gentleman.
A
lady's
parasol
was
found
upon
the
rack,
but
no
other
trace
was
to
be
seen
of
the
travellers
in
either
of
the
sections.
Apart
from
the
crime,
the
question
of
how
or
why
three
passengers
(one
of
them
a
lady)
could
get
out
of
the
train,
and
one
other
get
in
during
the
unbroken
run
between
Willesden
and
Rugby,
was
one
which
excited
the
utmost
curiosity
among
the
general
public,
and
gave
rise
to
much
speculation
in
the
London
Press.
John
Palmer,
the
guard
was
able
at
the
inquest
to
give
some
evidence
which
threw
a
little
light
upon
the
matter.
There
was
a
spot
between
Tring
and
Cheddington,
according
to
his
statement,
where,
on
account
of
some
repairs
to
the
line,
the
train
had
for
a
few
minutes
slowed
down
to
a
pace
not
exceeding
eight
or
ten
miles
an
hour.
At
that
place
it
might
be
possible
for
a
man,
or
even
for
an
exceptionally
active
woman,
to
have
left
the
train
without
serious
injury.
It
was
true
that
a
gang
of
platelayers
was
there,
and
that
they
had
seen
nothing,
but
it
was
their
custom
to
stand
in
the
middle
between
the
metals,
and
the
open
carriage
door
was
upon
the
far
side,
so
that
it
was
conceivable
that
someone
might
have
alighted
unseen,
as
the
darkness
would
by
that
time
be
drawing
in.
A
steep
embankment
would
instantly
screen
anyone
who
sprang
out
from
the
observation
of
the
navvies.
The
guard
also
deposed
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
movement
upon
the
platform
at
Willesden
Junction,
and
that
though
it
was
certain
that
no
one
had
either
joined
or
left
the
train
there,
it
was
still
quite
possible
that
some
of
the
passengers
might
have
changed
unseen
from
one
compartment
to
another.
It
was
by
no
means
uncommon
for
a
gentleman
to
finish
his
cigar
in
a
smoking
carriage
and
then
to
change
to
a
clearer
atmosphere.
Supposing
that
the
man
with
the
black
beard
had
done
so
at
Willesden
(and
the
half
smoked
cigar
upon
the
floor
seemed
to
favour
the
supposition),
he
would
naturally
go
into
the
nearest
section,
which
would
bring
him
into
the
company
of
the
two
other
actors
in
this
drama.
Thus
the
first
stage
