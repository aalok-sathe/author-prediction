it
is
unpleasant
to
feel
that
there
is
one
person
in
the
house
who
eagerly
desires
your
departure.
Mrs.
King's
sallow
face
and
forbidding
eyes
had
become
more
and
more
hateful
to
me.
She
was
no
longer
actively
rude
her
fear
of
her
husband
prevented
her
but
she
pushed
her
insane
jealousy
to
the
extent
of
ignoring
me,
never
addressing
me,
and
in
every
way
making
my
stay
at
Greylands
as
uncomfortable
as
she
could.
So
offensive
was
her
manner
during
that
last
day,
that
I
should
certainly
have
left
had
it
not
been
for
that
interview
with
my
host
in
the
evening
which
would,
I
hoped,
retrieve
my
broken
fortunes.
It
was
very
late
when
it
occurred,
for
my
relative,
who
had
been
receiving
even
more
telegrams
than
usual
during
the
day,
went
off
to
his
study
after
dinner,
and
only
emerged
when
the
household
had
retired
to
bed.
I
heard
him
go
round
locking
the
doors,
as
custom
was
of
a
night,
and
finally
he
joined
me
in
the
billiard
room.
His
stout
figure
was
wrapped
in
a
dressing
gown,
and
he
wore
a
pair
of
red
Turkish
slippers
without
any
heels.
Settling
down
into
an
arm
chair,
he
brewed
himself
a
glass
of
grog,
in
which
I
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
whisky
considerably
predominated
over
the
water.
"My
word!"
said
he,
"what
a
night!"
It
was,
indeed.
The
wind
was
howling
and
screaming
round
the
house,
and
the
latticed
windows
rattled
and
shook
as
if
they
were
coming
in.
The
glow
of
the
yellow
lamps
and
the
flavour
of
our
cigars
seemed
the
brighter
and
more
fragrant
for
the
contrast.
"Now,
my
boy,"
said
my
host,
"we
have
the
house
and
the
night
to
ourselves.
Let
me
have
an
idea
of
how
your
affairs
stand,
and
I
will
see
what
can
be
done
to
set
them
in
order.
I
wish
to
hear
every
detail."
Thus
encouraged,
I
entered
into
a
long
exposition,
in
which
all
my
tradesmen
and
creditors
from
my
landlord
to
my
valet,
figured
in
turn.
I
had
notes
in
my
pocket
book,
and
I
marshalled
my
facts,
and
gave,
I
flatter
myself,
a
very
businesslike
statement
of
my
own
unbusinesslike
ways
and
lamentable
position.
I
was
depressed,
however,
to
notice
that
my
companion's
eyes
were
vacant
and
his
attention
elsewhere.
When
he
did
occasionally
throw
out
a
remark
it
was
so
entirely
perfunctory
and
pointless,
that
I
was
sure
he
had
not
in
the
least
followed
my
remarks.
Every
now
and
then
he
roused
himself
and
put
on
some
show
of
interest,
asking
me
to
repeat
or
to
explain
more
fully,
but
it
was
always
to
sink
once
more
into
the
same
brown
study.
At
last
he
rose
and
threw
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
grate.
"I'll
tell
you
what,
my
boy,"
said
he.
"I
never
had
a
head
for
figures,
so
you
will
excuse
me.
You
must
jot
it
all
down
upon
paper,
and
let
me
have
a
note
