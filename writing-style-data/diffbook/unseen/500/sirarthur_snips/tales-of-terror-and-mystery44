in
life.
I
was
standing
at
the
Blue
John
Gap
when
he
came
across
the
field
to
me.
"Well,
doctor,"
said
he,
"you're
not
afraid,
anyhow."
"Afraid!"
I
answered.
"Afraid
of
what?"
"Of
it,"
said
he,
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
towards
the
black
vault,
"of
the
Terror
that
lives
in
the
Blue
John
Cave."
How
absurdly
easy
it
is
for
a
legend
to
arise
in
a
lonely
countryside!
I
examined
him
as
to
the
reasons
for
his
weird
belief.
It
seems
that
from
time
to
time
sheep
have
been
missing
from
the
fields,
carried
bodily
away,
according
to
Armitage.
That
they
could
have
wandered
away
of
their
own
accord
and
disappeared
among
the
mountains
was
an
explanation
to
which
he
would
not
listen.
On
one
occasion
a
pool
of
blood
had
been
found,
and
some
tufts
of
wool.
That
also,
I
pointed
out,
could
be
explained
in
a
perfectly
natural
way.
Further,
the
nights
upon
which
sheep
disappeared
were
invariably
very
dark,
cloudy
nights
with
no
moon.
This
I
met
with
the
obvious
retort
that
those
were
the
nights
which
a
commonplace
sheep
stealer
would
naturally
choose
for
his
work.
On
one
occasion
a
gap
had
been
made
in
a
wall,
and
some
of
the
stones
scattered
for
a
considerable
distance.
Human
agency
again,
in
my
opinion.
Finally,
Armitage
clinched
all
his
arguments
by
telling
me
that
he
had
actually
heard
the
Creature
indeed,
that
anyone
could
hear
it
who
remained
long
enough
at
the
Gap.
It
was
a
distant
roaring
of
an
immense
volume.
I
could
not
but
smile
at
this,
knowing,
as
I
do,
the
strange
reverberations
which
come
out
of
an
underground
water
system
running
amid
the
chasms
of
a
limestone
formation.
My
incredulity
annoyed
Armitage
so
that
he
turned
and
left
me
with
some
abruptness.
And
now
comes
the
queer
point
about
the
whole
business.
I
was
still
standing
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
various
statements
of
Armitage,
and
reflecting
how
readily
they
could
be
explained
away,
when
suddenly,
from
the
depth
of
the
tunnel
beside
me,
there
issued
a
most
extraordinary
sound.
How
shall
I
describe
it?
First
of
all,
it
seemed
to
be
a
great
distance
away,
far
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth.
Secondly,
in
spite
of
this
suggestion
of
distance,
it
was
very
loud.
Lastly,
it
was
not
a
boom,
nor
a
crash,
such
as
one
would
associate
with
falling
water
or
tumbling
rock,
but
it
was
a
high
whine,
tremulous
and
vibrating,
almost
like
the
whinnying
of
a
horse.
It
was
certainly
a
most
remarkable
experience,
and
one
which
for
a
moment,
I
must
admit,
gave
a
new
significance
to
Armitage's
words.
I
waited
by
the
Blue
John
Gap
for
half
an
hour
or
more,
but
there
was
no
return
of
the
sound,
so
at
last
I
wandered
back
to
the
farmhouse,
rather
mystified
by
what
had
occurred.
Decidedly
I
shall
explore
that
cavern
when
my
strength
is
restored.
Of
course,
