effect
produced
by
wounds
from
the
great
carnivora,
and
now
I
was
destined
to
experience
it,
for
I
had
lost
all
sense
of
personality,
and
was
as
interested
in
the
cat's
failure
or
success
as
if
it
were
some
game
which
I
was
watching.
And
then
gradually
my
mind
drifted
away
into
strange
vague
dreams,
always
with
that
black
face
and
red
tongue
coming
back
into
them,
and
so
I
lost
myself
in
the
nirvana
of
delirium,
the
blessed
relief
of
those
who
are
too
sorely
tried.
Tracing
the
course
of
events
afterwards,
I
conclude
that
I
must
have
been
insensible
for
about
two
hours.
What
roused
me
to
consciousness
once
more
was
that
sharp
metallic
click
which
had
been
the
precursor
of
my
terrible
experience.
It
was
the
shooting
back
of
the
spring
lock.
Then,
before
my
senses
were
clear
enough
to
entirely
apprehend
what
they
saw,
I
was
aware
of
the
round,
benevolent
face
of
my
cousin
peering
in
through
the
open
door.
What
he
saw
evidently
amazed
him.
There
was
the
cat
crouching
on
the
floor.
I
was
stretched
upon
my
back
in
my
shirt
sleeves
within
the
cage,
my
trousers
torn
to
ribbons
and
a
great
pool
of
blood
all
round
me.
I
can
see
his
amazed
face
now,
with
the
morning
sunlight
upon
it.
He
peered
at
me,
and
peered
again.
Then
he
closed
the
door
behind
him,
and
advanced
to
the
cage
to
see
if
I
were
really
dead.
I
cannot
undertake
to
say
what
happened.
I
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
witness
or
to
chronicle
such
events.
I
can
only
say
that
I
was
suddenly
conscious
that
his
face
was
away
from
me
that
he
was
looking
towards
the
animal.
"Good
old
Tommy!"
he
cried.
"Good
old
Tommy!"
Then
he
came
near
the
bars,
with
his
back
still
towards
me.
"Down,
you
stupid
beast!"
he
roared.
"Down,
sir!
Don't
you
know
your
master?"
Suddenly
even
in
my
bemuddled
brain
a
remembrance
came
of
those
words
of
his
when
he
had
said
that
the
taste
of
blood
would
turn
the
cat
into
a
fiend.
My
blood
had
done
it,
but
he
was
to
pay
the
price.
"Get
away!"
he
screamed.
"Get
away,
you
devil!
Baldwin!
Baldwin!
Oh,
my
God!"
And
then
I
heard
him
fall,
and
rise,
and
fall
again,
with
a
sound
like
the
ripping
of
sacking.
His
screams
grew
fainter
until
they
were
lost
in
the
worrying
snarl.
And
then,
after
I
thought
that
he
was
dead,
I
saw,
as
in
a
nightmare,
a
blinded,
tattered,
blood
soaked
figure
running
wildly
round
the
room
and
that
was
the
last
glimpse
which
I
had
of
him
before
I
fainted
once
again.
I
was
many
months
in
my
recovery
in
fact,
I
cannot
say
that
I
have
ever
recovered,
for
to
the
end
of
my
days
I
shall
carry
a
stick
as
a
sign
of
my
night
with
the
Brazilian
cat.
Baldwin,
the
groom,
and
the
other
servants
could
not
tell
what
