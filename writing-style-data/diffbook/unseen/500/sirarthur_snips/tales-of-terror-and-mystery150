my
life
time
to
protect.
"He
was
certainly
a
man
of
iron
nerve.
He
took
my
remarks
without
a
sign
either
of
surprise
or
of
defiance,
but
listened
gravely
and
attentively
until
I
had
finished.
Then
he
walked
across
the
room
without
a
word
and
struck
the
bell.
"'Ask
Miss
Andreas
to
be
so
kind
as
to
step
this
way,'
said
he
to
the
servant.
"My
daughter
entered,
and
the
man
closed
the
door
behind
her.
Then
he
took
her
hand
in
his.
"'Elise,'
said
he,
'your
father
has
just
discovered
that
I
am
a
villain.
He
knows
now
what
you
knew
before.'
"She
stood
in
silence,
listening.
"'He
says
that
we
are
to
part
for
ever,'
said
he.
"She
did
not
withdraw
her
hand.
"'Will
you
be
true
to
me,
or
will
you
remove
the
last
good
influence
which
is
ever
likely
to
come
into
my
life?'
"'John,'
she
cried,
passionately.
'I
will
never
abandon
you!
Never,
never,
not
if
the
whole
world
were
against
you.'
"In
vain
I
argued
and
pleaded
with
her.
It
was
absolutely
useless.
Her
whole
life
was
bound
up
in
this
man
before
me.
My
daughter,
gentlemen,
is
all
that
I
have
left
to
love,
and
it
filled
me
with
agony
when
I
saw
how
powerless
I
was
to
save
her
from
her
ruin.
My
helplessness
seemed
to
touch
this
man
who
was
the
cause
of
my
trouble.
"'It
may
not
be
as
bad
as
you
think,
sir,'
said
he,
in
his
quiet,
inflexible
way.
'I
love
Elise
with
a
love
which
is
strong
enough
to
rescue
even
one
who
has
such
a
record
as
I
have.
It
was
but
yesterday
that
I
promised
her
that
never
again
in
my
whole
life
would
I
do
a
thing
of
which
she
should
be
ashamed.
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
it,
and
never
yet
did
I
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
which
I
did
not
do.'
"He
spoke
with
an
air
which
carried
conviction
with
it.
As
he
concluded
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
he
drew
out
a
small
cardboard
box.
"'I
am
about
to
give
you
a
proof
of
my
determination,'
said
he.
'This,
Elise,
shall
be
the
first
fruits
of
your
redeeming
influence
over
me.
You
are
right,
sir,
in
thinking
that
I
had
designs
upon
the
jewels
in
your
possession.
Such
ventures
have
had
a
charm
for
me,
which
depended
as
much
upon
the
risk
run
as
upon
the
value
of
the
prize.
Those
famous
and
antique
stones
of
the
Jewish
priest
were
a
challenge
to
my
daring
and
my
ingenuity.
I
determined
to
get
them.'
"'I
guessed
as
much.'
"'There
was
only
one
thing
that
you
did
not
guess.'
"'And
what
is
that?'
"'That
I
got
them.
They
are
in
this
box.'
"He
opened
the
box,
and
tilted
out
the
contents
upon
the
corner
of
my
desk.
My
hair
rose
and
my
flesh
grew
cold
as
I
looked.
There
were
twelve
magnificent
square
stones
engraved
