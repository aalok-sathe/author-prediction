good
deal
of
the
vigour
and
activity
of
his
youth.
In
one
hand
he
carried
a
brown
leather
Gladstone
bag.
His
companion
was
a
lady,
tall
and
erect,
walking
with
a
vigorous
step
which
outpaced
the
gentleman
beside
her.
She
wore
a
long,
fawn
coloured
dust
cloak,
a
black,
close
fitting
toque,
and
a
dark
veil
which
concealed
the
greater
part
of
her
face.
The
two
might
very
well
have
passed
as
father
and
daughter.
They
walked
swiftly
down
the
line
of
carriages,
glancing
in
at
the
windows,
until
the
guard,
John
Palmer,
overtook
them.
"Now
then,
sir,
look
sharp,
the
train
is
going,"
said
he.
"First
class,"
the
man
answered.
The
guard
turned
the
handle
of
the
nearest
door.
In
the
carriage
which
he
had
opened,
there
sat
a
small
man
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth.
His
appearance
seems
to
have
impressed
itself
upon
the
guard's
memory,
for
he
was
prepared,
afterwards,
to
describe
or
to
identify
him.
He
was
a
man
of
thirty
four
or
thirty
five
years
of
age,
dressed
in
some
grey
material,
sharp
nosed,
alert,
with
a
ruddy,
weather
beaten
face,
and
a
small,
closely
cropped,
black
beard.
He
glanced
up
as
the
door
was
opened.
The
tall
man
paused
with
his
foot
upon
the
step.
"This
is
a
smoking
compartment.
The
lady
dislikes
smoke,"
said
he,
looking
round
at
the
guard.
"All
right!
Here
you
are,
sir!"
said
John
Palmer.
He
slammed
the
door
of
the
smoking
carriage,
opened
that
of
the
next
one,
which
was
empty,
and
thrust
the
two
travellers
in.
At
the
same
moment
he
sounded
his
whistle
and
the
wheels
of
the
train
began
to
move.
The
man
with
the
cigar
was
at
the
window
of
his
carriage,
and
said
something
to
the
guard
as
he
rolled
past
him,
but
the
words
were
lost
in
the
bustle
of
the
departure.
Palmer
stepped
into
the
guard's
van,
as
it
came
up
to
him,
and
thought
no
more
of
the
incident.
Twelve
minutes
after
its
departure
the
train
reached
Willesden
Junction,
where
it
stopped
for
a
very
short
interval.
An
examination
of
the
tickets
has
made
it
certain
that
no
one
either
joined
or
left
it
at
this
time,
and
no
passenger
was
seen
to
alight
upon
the
platform.
At
5:14
the
journey
to
Manchester
was
resumed,
and
Rugby
was
reached
at
6:50,
the
express
being
five
minutes
late.
At
Rugby
the
attention
of
the
station
officials
was
drawn
to
the
fact
that
the
door
of
one
of
the
first
class
carriages
was
open.
An
examination
of
that
compartment,
and
of
its
neighbour,
disclosed
a
remarkable
state
of
affairs.
The
smoking
carriage
in
which
the
short,
red
faced
man
with
the
black
beard
had
been
seen
was
now
empty.
Save
for
a
half
smoked
cigar,
there
was
no
trace
whatever
of
its
recent
occupant.
The
door
of
this
carriage
was
fastened.
In
the
next
compartment,
to
which
attention
had
been
originally
drawn,
there
was
no
sign
either
of
the
gentleman
with
