rubbish
found
in
a
cupboard
in
an
ancient
house
at
the
back
of
the
Rue
Mathurin,
in
the
Quartier
Latin.
The
dining
room
of
this
old
house
is
decorated
with
a
coat
of
arms,
chevrons,
and
bars
rouge
upon
a
field
argent,
which
prove,
upon
inquiry,
to
be
the
shield
of
Nicholas
de
la
Reynie,
a
high
official
of
King
Louis
XIV.
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
other
articles
in
the
cupboard
date
back
to
the
early
days
of
that
king.
The
inference
is,
therefore,
that
they
were
all
the
property
of
this
Nicholas
de
la
Reynie,
who
was,
as
I
understand,
the
gentleman
specially
concerned
with
the
maintenance
and
execution
of
the
Draconic
laws
of
that
epoch."
"What
then?"
"I
would
ask
you
now
to
take
the
funnel
into
your
hands
once
more
and
to
examine
the
upper
brass
rim.
Can
you
make
out
any
lettering
upon
it?"
There
were
certainly
some
scratches
upon
it,
almost
obliterated
by
time.
The
general
effect
was
of
several
letters,
the
last
of
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
B.
"You
make
it
a
B?"
"Yes,
I
do."
"So
do
I.
In
fact,
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
is
a
B."
"But
the
nobleman
you
mentioned
would
have
had
R
for
his
initial."
"Exactly!
That's
the
beauty
of
it.
He
owned
this
curious
object,
and
yet
he
had
someone
else's
initials
upon
it.
Why
did
he
do
this?"
"I
can't
imagine;
can
you?"
"Well,
I
might,
perhaps,
guess.
Do
you
observe
something
drawn
a
little
farther
along
the
rim?"
"I
should
say
it
was
a
crown."
"It
is
undoubtedly
a
crown;
but
if
you
examine
it
in
a
good
light,
you
will
convince
yourself
that
it
is
not
an
ordinary
crown.
It
is
a
heraldic
crown
a
badge
of
rank,
and
it
consists
of
an
alternation
of
four
pearls
and
strawberry
leaves,
the
proper
badge
of
a
marquis.
We
may
infer,
therefore,
that
the
person
whose
initials
end
in
B
was
entitled
to
wear
that
coronet."
"Then
this
common
leather
filler
belonged
to
a
marquis?"
Dacre
gave
a
peculiar
smile.
"Or
to
some
member
of
the
family
of
a
marquis,"
said
he.
"So
much
we
have
clearly
gathered
from
this
engraved
rim."
"But
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
dreams?"
I
do
not
know
whether
it
was
from
a
look
upon
Dacre's
face,
or
from
some
subtle
suggestion
in
his
manner,
but
a
feeling
of
repulsion,
of
unreasoning
horror,
came
upon
me
as
I
looked
at
the
gnarled
old
lump
of
leather.
"I
have
more
than
once
received
important
information
through
my
dreams,"
said
my
companion
in
the
didactic
manner
which
he
loved
to
affect.
"I
make
it
a
rule
now
when
I
am
in
doubt
upon
any
material
point
to
place
the
article
in
question
beside
me
as
I
sleep,
and
to
hope
for
some
enlightenment.
The
process
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
very
obscure,
though
it
has
not
yet
received
the
blessing
of
orthodox
