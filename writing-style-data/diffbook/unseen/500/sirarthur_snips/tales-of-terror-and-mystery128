the
attention
of
Mrs.
Woods.
When
Mrs.
Woods
descended,
Dr.
Lana
had
made
up
his
mind
to
talk
it
over
with
his
visitor,
and
had,
therefore,
sent
his
housekeeper
back
to
her
room.
This
conversation
had
lasted
a
long
time,
had
become
more
and
more
fiery,
and
had
ended
by
a
personal
struggle,
in
which
the
doctor
lost
his
life.
The
fact,
revealed
by
a
post
mortem,
that
his
heart
was
much
diseased
an
ailment
quite
unsuspected
during
his
life
would
make
it
possible
that
death
might
in
his
case
ensue
from
injuries
which
would
not
be
fatal
to
a
healthy
man.
Arthur
Morton
had
then
removed
his
sister's
photograph,
and
had
made
his
way
homeward,
stepping
aside
into
the
laurel
bushes
to
avoid
Mrs.
Madding
at
the
gate.
This
was
the
theory
of
the
prosecution,
and
the
case
which
they
presented
was
a
formidable
one.
On
the
other
hand,
there
were
some
strong
points
for
the
defence.
Morton
was
high
spirited
and
impetuous,
like
his
sister,
but
he
was
respected
and
liked
by
everyone,
and
his
frank
and
honest
nature
seemed
to
be
incapable
of
such
a
crime.
His
own
explanation
was
that
he
was
anxious
to
have
a
conversation
with
Dr.
Lana
about
some
urgent
family
matters
(from
first
to
last
he
refused
even
to
mention
the
name
of
his
sister).
He
did
not
attempt
to
deny
that
this
conversation
would
probably
have
been
of
an
unpleasant
nature.
He
had
heard
from
a
patient
that
the
doctor
was
out,
and
he
therefore
waited
until
about
three
in
the
morning
for
his
return,
but
as
he
had
seen
nothing
of
him
up
to
that
hour,
he
had
given
it
up
and
had
returned
home.
As
to
his
death,
he
knew
no
more
about
it
than
the
constable
who
arrested
him.
He
had
formerly
been
an
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased
man;
but
circumstances,
which
he
would
prefer
not
to
mention,
had
brought
about
a
change
in
his
sentiments.
There
were
several
facts
which
supported
his
innocence.
It
was
certain
that
Dr.
Lana
was
alive
and
in
his
study
at
half
past
eleven
o'clock.
Mrs.
Woods
was
prepared
to
swear
that
it
was
at
that
hour
that
she
had
heard
his
voice.
The
friends
of
the
prisoner
contended
that
it
was
probable
that
at
that
time
Dr.
Lana
was
not
alone.
The
sound
which
had
originally
attracted
the
attention
of
the
housekeeper,
and
her
master's
unusual
impatience
that
she
should
leave
him
in
peace,
seemed
to
point
to
that.
If
this
were
so
then
it
appeared
to
be
probable
that
he
had
met
his
end
between
the
moment
when
the
housekeeper
heard
his
voice
and
the
time
when
Mrs.
Madding
made
her
first
call
and
found
it
impossible
to
attract
his
attention.
But
if
this
were
the
time
of
his
death,
then
it
was
certain
that
Mr.
Arthur
Morton
could
not
be
guilty,
as
it
was
AFTER
this
that
she
had
met
the
young
squire
at
the
gate.
If
this
