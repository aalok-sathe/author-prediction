of
honour
that
no
human
soul
shall
hear
it
from
your
lips.
I
am
proud
still
God
help
me!
or,
at
least,
I
am
proud
enough
to
resent
that
pity
which
this
story
would
draw
upon
me.
I
have
smiled
at
envy,
and
disregarded
hatred,
but
pity
is
more
than
I
can
tolerate.
"You
have
heard
the
source
from
which
the
voice
comes
that
voice
which
has,
as
I
understand,
excited
so
much
curiosity
in
my
household.
I
am
aware
of
the
rumours
to
which
it
has
given
rise.
These
speculations,
whether
scandalous
or
superstitious,
are
such
as
I
can
disregard
and
forgive.
What
I
should
never
forgive
would
be
a
disloyal
spying
and
eavesdropping
in
order
to
satisfy
an
illicit
curiosity.
But
of
that,
Mr.
Colmore,
I
acquit
you.
"When
I
was
a
young
man,
sir,
many
years
younger
than
you
are
now,
I
was
launched
upon
town
without
a
friend
or
adviser,
and
with
a
purse
which
brought
only
too
many
false
friends
and
false
advisers
to
my
side.
I
drank
deeply
of
the
wine
of
life
if
there
is
a
man
living
who
has
drunk
more
deeply
he
is
not
a
man
whom
I
envy.
My
purse
suffered,
my
character
suffered,
my
constitution
suffered,
stimulants
became
a
necessity
to
me,
I
was
a
creature
from
whom
my
memory
recoils.
And
it
was
at
that
time,
the
time
of
my
blackest
degradation,
that
God
sent
into
my
life
the
gentlest,
sweetest
spirit
that
ever
descended
as
a
ministering
angel
from
above.
She
loved
me,
broken
as
I
was,
loved
me,
and
spent
her
life
in
making
a
man
once
more
of
that
which
had
degraded
itself
to
the
level
of
the
beasts.
"But
a
fell
disease
struck
her,
and
she
withered
away
before
my
eyes.
In
the
hour
of
her
agony
it
was
never
of
herself,
of
her
own
sufferings
and
her
own
death
that
she
thought.
It
was
all
of
me.
The
one
pang
which
her
fate
brought
to
her
was
the
fear
that
when
her
influence
was
removed
I
should
revert
to
that
which
I
had
been.
It
was
in
vain
that
I
made
oath
to
her
that
no
drop
of
wine
would
ever
cross
my
lips.
She
knew
only
too
well
the
hold
that
the
devil
had
upon
me
she
who
had
striven
so
to
loosen
it
and
it
haunted
her
night
and
day
the
thought
that
my
soul
might
again
be
within
his
grip.
"It
was
from
some
friend's
gossip
of
the
sick
room
that
she
heard
of
this
invention
this
phonograph
and
with
the
quick
insight
of
a
loving
woman
she
saw
how
she
might
use
it
for
her
ends.
She
sent
me
to
London
to
procure
the
best
which
money
could
buy.
With
her
dying
breath
she
gasped
into
it
the
words
which
have
held
me
straight
ever
since.
Lonely
and
broken,
what
else
have
I
in
all
the
world
to
uphold
me?
But
it
is
enough.
Please
God,
I
shall
face
