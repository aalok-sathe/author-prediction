antecedents.
I
should
not
mention
the
matter
if
it
were
not
that
you
are
now
one
of
ourselves,
and
that
the
facts
might
come
to
your
ears
in
some
harsher
form
if
I
were
silent
upon
them.
I
always
took
it
for
granted
that
you
knew
that
you
were
in
the
service
of
'Devil'
Bollamore."
"But
why
'Devil'?"
I
asked.
"Ah,
you
are
young
and
the
world
moves
fast,
but
twenty
years
ago
the
name
of
'Devil'
Bollamore
was
one
of
the
best
known
in
London.
He
was
the
leader
of
the
fastest
set,
bruiser,
driver,
gambler,
drunkard
a
survival
of
the
old
type,
and
as
bad
as
the
worst
of
them."
I
stared
at
him
in
amazement.
"What!"
I
cried,
"that
quiet,
studious,
sad
faced
man?"
"The
greatest
rip
and
debauchee
in
England!
All
between
ourselves,
Colmore.
But
you
understand
now
what
I
mean
when
I
say
that
a
woman's
voice
in
his
room
might
even
now
give
rise
to
suspicions."
"But
what
can
have
changed
him
so?"
"Little
Beryl
Clare,
when
she
took
the
risk
of
becoming
his
wife.
That
was
the
turning
point.
He
had
got
so
far
that
his
own
fast
set
had
thrown
him
over.
There
is
a
world
of
difference,
you
know,
between
a
man
who
drinks
and
a
drunkard.
They
all
drink,
but
they
taboo
a
drunkard.
He
had
become
a
slave
to
it
hopeless
and
helpless.
Then
she
stepped
in,
saw
the
possibilities
of
a
fine
man
in
the
wreck,
took
her
chance
in
marrying
him
though
she
might
have
had
the
pick
of
a
dozen,
and,
by
devoting
her
life
to
it,
brought
him
back
to
manhood
and
decency.
You
have
observed
that
no
liquor
is
ever
kept
in
the
house.
There
never
has
been
any
since
her
foot
crossed
its
threshold.
A
drop
of
it
would
be
like
blood
to
a
tiger
even
now."
"Then
her
influence
still
holds
him?"
"That
is
the
wonder
of
it.
When
she
died
three
years
ago,
we
all
expected
and
feared
that
he
would
fall
back
into
his
old
ways.
She
feared
it
herself,
and
the
thought
gave
a
terror
to
death,
for
she
was
like
a
guardian
angel
to
that
man,
and
lived
only
for
the
one
purpose.
By
the
way,
did
you
see
a
black
japanned
box
in
his
room?"
"Yes."
"I
fancy
it
contains
her
letters.
If
ever
he
has
occasion
to
be
away,
if
only
for
a
single
night,
he
invariably
takes
his
black
japanned
box
with
him.
Well,
well,
Colmore,
perhaps
I
have
told
you
rather
more
than
I
should,
but
I
shall
expect
you
to
reciprocate
if
anything
of
interest
should
come
to
your
knowledge."
I
could
see
that
the
worthy
man
was
consumed
with
curiosity
and
just
a
little
piqued
that
I,
the
newcomer,
should
have
been
the
first
to
penetrate
into
the
untrodden
chamber.
But
the
fact
raised
me
in
his
esteem,
and
from
that
time
onwards
I
found
myself
upon
more
confidential
terms
with
him.
