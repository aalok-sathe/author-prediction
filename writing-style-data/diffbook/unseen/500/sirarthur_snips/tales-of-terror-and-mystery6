wings
and
lashed
against
my
face,
blurring
my
glasses
so
that
I
could
hardly
see.
I
got
down
on
to
a
low
speed,
for
it
was
painful
to
travel
against
it.
As
I
got
higher
it
became
hail,
and
I
had
to
turn
tail
to
it.
One
of
my
cylinders
was
out
of
action
a
dirty
plug,
I
should
imagine,
but
still
I
was
rising
steadily
with
plenty
of
power.
After
a
bit
the
trouble
passed,
whatever
it
was,
and
I
heard
the
full,
deep
throated
purr
the
ten
singing
as
one.
That's
where
the
beauty
of
our
modern
silencers
comes
in.
We
can
at
last
control
our
engines
by
ear.
How
they
squeal
and
squeak
and
sob
when
they
are
in
trouble!
All
those
cries
for
help
were
wasted
in
the
old
days,
when
every
sound
was
swallowed
up
by
the
monstrous
racket
of
the
machine.
If
only
the
early
aviators
could
come
back
to
see
the
beauty
and
perfection
of
the
mechanism
which
have
been
bought
at
the
cost
of
their
lives!
"About
nine
thirty
I
was
nearing
the
clouds.
Down
below
me,
all
blurred
and
shadowed
with
rain,
lay
the
vast
expanse
of
Salisbury
Plain.
Half
a
dozen
flying
machines
were
doing
hackwork
at
the
thousand
foot
level,
looking
like
little
black
swallows
against
the
green
background.
I
dare
say
they
were
wondering
what
I
was
doing
up
in
cloud
land.
Suddenly
a
grey
curtain
drew
across
beneath
me
and
the
wet
folds
of
vapours
were
swirling
round
my
face.
It
was
clammily
cold
and
miserable.
But
I
was
above
the
hail
storm,
and
that
was
something
gained.
The
cloud
was
as
dark
and
thick
as
a
London
fog.
In
my
anxiety
to
get
clear,
I
cocked
her
nose
up
until
the
automatic
alarm
bell
rang,
and
I
actually
began
to
slide
backwards.
My
sopped
and
dripping
wings
had
made
me
heavier
than
I
thought,
but
presently
I
was
in
lighter
cloud,
and
soon
had
cleared
the
first
layer.
There
was
a
second
opal
coloured
and
fleecy
at
a
great
height
above
my
head,
a
white,
unbroken
ceiling
above,
and
a
dark,
unbroken
floor
below,
with
the
monoplane
labouring
upwards
upon
a
vast
spiral
between
them.
It
is
deadly
lonely
in
these
cloud
spaces.
Once
a
great
flight
of
some
small
water
birds
went
past
me,
flying
very
fast
to
the
westwards.
The
quick
whir
of
their
wings
and
their
musical
cry
were
cheery
to
my
ear.
I
fancy
that
they
were
teal,
but
I
am
a
wretched
zoologist.
Now
that
we
humans
have
become
birds
we
must
really
learn
to
know
our
brethren
by
sight.
"The
wind
down
beneath
me
whirled
and
swayed
the
broad
cloud
plain.
Once
a
great
eddy
formed
in
it,
a
whirlpool
of
vapour,
and
through
it,
as
down
a
funnel,
I
caught
sight
of
the
distant
world.
A
large
white
biplane
was
passing
at
a
vast
depth
beneath
me.
I
fancy
it
was
the
morning
mail
service
betwixt
Bristol
and
London.
