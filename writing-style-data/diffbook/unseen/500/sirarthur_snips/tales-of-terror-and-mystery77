be
disregarded.
Besides
these,
however,
there
are
seven
which
have,
or
have
had,
proper
lines
running
down
and
connecting
with
points
to
the
main
line,
so
as
to
convey
their
produce
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine
to
the
great
centres
of
distribution.
In
every
case
these
lines
are
only
a
few
miles
in
length.
Out
of
the
seven,
four
belong
to
collieries
which
are
worked
out,
or
at
least
to
shafts
which
are
no
longer
used.
These
are
the
Redgauntlet,
Hero,
Slough
of
Despond,
and
Heartsease
mines,
the
latter
having
ten
years
ago
been
one
of
the
principal
mines
in
Lancashire.
These
four
side
lines
may
be
eliminated
from
our
inquiry,
for,
to
prevent
possible
accidents,
the
rails
nearest
to
the
main
line
have
been
taken
up,
and
there
is
no
longer
any
connection.
There
remain
three
other
side
lines
leading
(a)
To
the
Carnstock
Iron
Works;
(b)
To
the
Big
Ben
Colliery;
(c)
To
the
Perseverance
Colliery.
"Of
these
the
Big
Ben
line
is
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long,
and
ends
at
a
dead
wall
of
coal
waiting
removal
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine.
Nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
there
of
any
special.
The
Carnstock
Iron
Works
line
was
blocked
all
day
upon
the
3rd
of
June
by
sixteen
truckloads
of
hematite.
It
is
a
single
line,
and
nothing
could
have
passed.
As
to
the
Perseverance
line,
it
is
a
large
double
line,
which
does
a
considerable
traffic,
for
the
output
of
the
mine
is
very
large.
On
the
3rd
of
June
this
traffic
proceeded
as
usual;
hundreds
of
men
including
a
gang
of
railway
platelayers
were
working
along
the
two
miles
and
a
quarter
which
constitute
the
total
length
of
the
line,
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
an
unexpected
train
could
have
come
down
there
without
attracting
universal
attention.
It
may
be
remarked
in
conclusion
that
this
branch
line
is
nearer
to
St.
Helens
than
the
point
at
which
the
engine
driver
was
discovered,
so
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
train
was
past
that
point
before
misfortune
overtook
her.
"As
to
John
Slater,
there
is
no
clue
to
be
gathered
from
his
appearance
or
injuries.
We
can
only
say
that,
so
far
as
we
can
see,
he
met
his
end
by
falling
off
his
engine,
though
why
he
fell,
or
what
became
of
the
engine
after
his
fall,
is
a
question
upon
which
I
do
not
feel
qualified
to
offer
an
opinion."
In
conclusion,
the
inspector
offered
his
resignation
to
the
Board,
being
much
nettled
by
an
accusation
of
incompetence
in
the
London
papers.
A
month
elapsed,
during
which
both
the
police
and
the
company
prosecuted
their
inquiries
without
the
slightest
success.
A
reward
was
offered
and
a
pardon
promised
in
case
of
crime,
but
they
were
both
unclaimed.
Every
day
the
public
opened
their
papers
with
the
conviction
that
so
grotesque
a
mystery
would
at
last
be
solved,
but
week
after
week
passed
by,
and
a
