at
Bishop's
Crossing.
And,
then,
just
as
the
matchmakers
had
finally
given
him
up
in
despair,
his
engagement
was
suddenly
announced
to
Miss
Frances
Morton,
of
Leigh
Hall.
Miss
Morton
was
a
young
lady
who
was
well
known
upon
the
country
side,
her
father,
James
Haldane
Morton,
having
been
the
Squire
of
Bishop's
Crossing.
Both
her
parents
were,
however,
dead,
and
she
lived
with
her
only
brother,
Arthur
Morton,
who
had
inherited
the
family
estate.
In
person
Miss
Morton
was
tall
and
stately,
and
she
was
famous
for
her
quick,
impetuous
nature
and
for
her
strength
of
character.
She
met
Dr.
Lana
at
a
garden
party,
and
a
friendship,
which
quickly
ripened
into
love,
sprang
up
between
them.
Nothing
could
exceed
their
devotion
to
each
other.
There
was
some
discrepancy
in
age,
he
being
thirty
seven,
and
she
twenty
four;
but,
save
in
that
one
respect,
there
was
no
possible
objection
to
be
found
with
the
match.
The
engagement
was
in
February,
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
in
August.
Upon
the
3rd
of
June
Dr.
Lana
received
a
letter
from
abroad.
In
a
small
village
the
postmaster
is
also
in
a
position
to
be
the
gossip
master,
and
Mr.
Bankley,
of
Bishop's
Crossing,
had
many
of
the
secrets
of
his
neighbours
in
his
possession.
Of
this
particular
letter
he
remarked
only
that
it
was
in
a
curious
envelope,
that
it
was
in
a
man's
handwriting,
that
the
postscript
was
Buenos
Ayres,
and
the
stamp
of
the
Argentine
Republic.
It
was
the
first
letter
which
he
had
ever
known
Dr.
Lana
to
have
from
abroad
and
this
was
the
reason
why
his
attention
was
particularly
called
to
it
before
he
handed
it
to
the
local
postman.
It
was
delivered
by
the
evening
delivery
of
that
date.
Next
morning
that
is,
upon
the
4th
of
June
Dr.
Lana
called
upon
Miss
Morton,
and
a
long
interview
followed,
from
which
he
was
observed
to
return
in
a
state
of
great
agitation.
Miss
Morton
remained
in
her
room
all
that
day,
and
her
maid
found
her
several
times
in
tears.
In
the
course
of
a
week
it
was
an
open
secret
to
the
whole
village
that
the
engagement
was
at
an
end,
that
Dr.
Lana
had
behaved
shamefully
to
the
young
lady,
and
that
Arthur
Morton,
her
brother,
was
talking
of
horse
whipping
him.
In
what
particular
respect
the
doctor
had
behaved
badly
was
unknown
some
surmised
one
thing
and
some
another;
but
it
was
observed,
and
taken
as
the
obvious
sign
of
a
guilty
conscience,
that
he
would
go
for
miles
round
rather
than
pass
the
windows
of
Leigh
Hall,
and
that
he
gave
up
attending
morning
service
upon
Sundays
where
he
might
have
met
the
young
lady.
There
was
an
advertisement
also
in
the
Lancet
as
to
the
sale
of
a
practice
which
mentioned
no
names,
but
which
was
thought
by
some
to
refer
to
Bishop's
Crossing,
and
to
mean
that
Dr.
Lana
was
thinking
of
abandoning
