myself.
I
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know.
Take
it
in
your
hands
and
examine
it."
I
did
so,
and
found
that
what
I
had
imagined
to
be
wood
was
in
reality
leather,
though
age
had
dried
it
into
an
extreme
hardness.
It
was
a
large
funnel,
and
might
hold
a
quart
when
full.
The
brass
rim
encircled
the
wide
end,
but
the
narrow
was
also
tipped
with
metal.
"What
do
you
make
of
it?"
asked
Dacre.
"I
should
imagine
that
it
belonged
to
some
vintner
or
maltster
in
the
Middle
Ages,"
said
I.
"I
have
seen
in
England
leathern
drinking
flagons
of
the
seventeenth
century
'black
jacks'
as
they
were
called
which
were
of
the
same
colour
and
hardness
as
this
filler."
"I
dare
say
the
date
would
be
about
the
same,"
said
Dacre,
"and,
no
doubt,
also,
it
was
used
for
filling
a
vessel
with
liquid.
If
my
suspicions
are
correct,
however,
it
was
a
queer
vintner
who
used
it,
and
a
very
singular
cask
which
was
filled.
Do
you
observe
nothing
strange
at
the
spout
end
of
the
funnel."
As
I
held
it
to
the
light
I
observed
that
at
a
spot
some
five
inches
above
the
brass
tip
the
narrow
neck
of
the
leather
funnel
was
all
haggled
and
scored,
as
if
someone
had
notched
it
round
with
a
blunt
knife.
Only
at
that
point
was
there
any
roughening
of
the
dead
black
surface.
"Someone
has
tried
to
cut
off
the
neck."
"Would
you
call
it
a
cut?"
"It
is
torn
and
lacerated.
It
must
have
taken
some
strength
to
leave
these
marks
on
such
tough
material,
whatever
the
instrument
may
have
been.
But
what
do
you
think
of
it?
I
can
tell
that
you
know
more
than
you
say."
Dacre
smiled,
and
his
little
eyes
twinkled
with
knowledge.
"Have
you
included
the
psychology
of
dreams
among
your
learned
studies?"
he
asked.
"I
did
not
even
know
that
there
was
such
a
psychology."
"My
dear
sir,
that
shelf
above
the
gem
case
is
filled
with
volumes,
from
Albertus
Magnus
onward,
which
deal
with
no
other
subject.
It
is
a
science
in
itself."
"A
science
of
charlatans!"
"The
charlatan
is
always
the
pioneer.
From
the
astrologer
came
the
astronomer,
from
the
alchemist
the
chemist,
from
the
mesmerist
the
experimental
psychologist.
The
quack
of
yesterday
is
the
professor
of
tomorrow.
Even
such
subtle
and
elusive
things
as
dreams
will
in
time
be
reduced
to
system
and
order.
When
that
time
comes
the
researches
of
our
friends
on
the
bookshelf
yonder
will
no
longer
be
the
amusement
of
the
mystic,
but
the
foundations
of
a
science."
"Supposing
that
is
so,
what
has
the
science
of
dreams
to
do
with
a
large,
black,
brass
rimmed
funnel?"
"I
will
tell
you.
You
know
that
I
have
an
agent
who
is
always
on
the
look
out
for
rarities
and
curiosities
for
my
collection.
Some
days
ago
he
heard
of
a
dealer
upon
one
of
the
Quais
who
had
acquired
some
old
