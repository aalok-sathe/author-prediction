and
made
himself
such
a
valuable
decoy,
that
it
was
their
favourite
game
afterwards.
They
had
made
it
right
with
Tammany
and
with
the
police,
so
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
ever
stop
them,
for
those
were
in
the
days
before
the
Lexow
Commission,
and
if
you
only
had
a
pull,
you
could
do
pretty
nearly
everything
you
wanted.
"And
nothing
would
have
stopped
them
if
they
had
only
stuck
to
cards
and
New
York,
but
they
must
needs
come
up
Rochester
way,
and
forge
a
name
upon
a
cheque.
It
was
my
brother
that
did
it,
though
everyone
knew
that
it
was
under
the
influence
of
Sparrow
MacCoy.
I
bought
up
that
cheque,
and
a
pretty
sum
it
cost
me.
Then
I
went
to
my
brother,
laid
it
before
him
on
the
table,
and
swore
to
him
that
I
would
prosecute
if
he
did
not
clear
out
of
the
country.
At
first
he
simply
laughed.
I
could
not
prosecute,
he
said,
without
breaking
our
mother's
heart,
and
he
knew
that
I
would
not
do
that.
I
made
him
understand,
however,
that
our
mother's
heart
was
being
broken
in
any
case,
and
that
I
had
set
firm
on
the
point
that
I
would
rather
see
him
in
Rochester
gaol
than
in
a
New
York
hotel.
So
at
last
he
gave
in,
and
he
made
me
a
solemn
promise
that
he
would
see
Sparrow
MacCoy
no
more,
that
he
would
go
to
Europe,
and
that
he
would
turn
his
hand
to
any
honest
trade
that
I
helped
him
to
get.
I
took
him
down
right
away
to
an
old
family
friend,
Joe
Willson,
who
is
an
exporter
of
American
watches
and
clocks,
and
I
got
him
to
give
Edward
an
agency
in
London,
with
a
small
salary
and
a
15
per
cent
commission
on
all
business.
His
manner
and
appearance
were
so
good
that
he
won
the
old
man
over
at
once,
and
within
a
week
he
was
sent
off
to
London
with
a
case
full
of
samples.
"It
seemed
to
me
that
this
business
of
the
cheque
had
really
given
my
brother
a
fright,
and
that
there
was
some
chance
of
his
settling
down
into
an
honest
line
of
life.
My
mother
had
spoken
with
him,
and
what
she
said
had
touched
him,
for
she
had
always
been
the
best
of
mothers
to
him
and
he
had
been
the
great
sorrow
of
her
life.
But
I
knew
that
this
man
Sparrow
MacCoy
had
a
great
influence
over
Edward
and
my
chance
of
keeping
the
lad
straight
lay
in
breaking
the
connection
between
them.
I
had
a
friend
in
the
New
York
detective
force,
and
through
him
I
kept
a
watch
upon
MacCoy.
When,
within
a
fortnight
of
my
brother's
sailing,
I
heard
that
MacCoy
had
taken
a
berth
in
the
Etruria,
I
was
as
certain
as
if
he
had
told
me
that
he
was
going
over
to
England
for
the
purpose
of
coaxing
Edward
back
again
into
the
ways
