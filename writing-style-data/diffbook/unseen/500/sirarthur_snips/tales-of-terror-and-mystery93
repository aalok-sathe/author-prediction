out.
"My
dear
Thomas,
how
are
you?"
said
he,
heartily.
But
the
heartiness
was
by
no
means
reciprocal.
The
owner
of
the
grounds
glared
at
me
over
his
brother
in
law's
shoulder,
and
I
caught
broken
scraps
of
sentences
"well
known
wishes
...
hatred
of
strangers
...
unjustifiable
intrusion
...
perfectly
inexcusable."
Then
there
was
a
muttered
explanation,
and
the
two
of
them
came
over
together
to
the
side
of
the
fly.
"Let
me
present
you
to
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
Dr.
Hamilton,"
said
Lord
Linchmere.
"You
will
find
that
you
have
a
strong
community
of
tastes."
I
bowed.
Sir
Thomas
stood
very
stiffly,
looking
at
me
severely
from
under
the
broad
brim
of
his
hat.
"Lord
Linchmere
tells
me
that
you
know
something
about
beetles,"
said
he.
"What
do
you
know
about
beetles?"
"I
know
what
I
have
learned
from
your
work
upon
the
coleoptera,
Sir
Thomas,"
I
answered.
"Give
me
the
names
of
the
better
known
species
of
the
British
scarabaei,"
said
he.
I
had
not
expected
an
examination,
but
fortunately
I
was
ready
for
one.
My
answers
seemed
to
please
him,
for
his
stern
features
relaxed.
"You
appear
to
have
read
my
book
with
some
profit,
sir,"
said
he.
"It
is
a
rare
thing
for
me
to
meet
anyone
who
takes
an
intelligent
interest
in
such
matters.
People
can
find
time
for
such
trivialities
as
sport
or
society,
and
yet
the
beetles
are
overlooked.
I
can
assure
you
that
the
greater
part
of
the
idiots
in
this
part
of
the
country
are
unaware
that
I
have
ever
written
a
book
at
all
I,
the
first
man
who
ever
described
the
true
function
of
the
elytra.
I
am
glad
to
see
you,
sir,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
I
can
show
you
some
specimens
which
will
interest
you."
He
stepped
into
the
fly
and
drove
up
with
us
to
the
house,
expounding
to
me
as
we
went
some
recent
researches
which
he
had
made
into
the
anatomy
of
the
lady
bird.
I
have
said
that
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter
wore
a
large
hat
drawn
down
over
his
brows.
As
he
entered
the
hall
he
uncovered
himself,
and
I
was
at
once
aware
of
a
singular
characteristic
which
the
hat
had
concealed.
His
forehead,
which
was
naturally
high,
and
higher
still
on
account
of
receding
hair,
was
in
a
continual
state
of
movement.
Some
nervous
weakness
kept
the
muscles
in
a
constant
spasm,
which
sometimes
produced
a
mere
twitching
and
sometimes
a
curious
rotary
movement
unlike
anything
which
I
had
ever
seen
before.
It
was
strikingly
visible
as
he
turned
towards
us
after
entering
the
study,
and
seemed
the
more
singular
from
the
contrast
with
the
hard,
steady,
grey
eyes
which
looked
out
from
underneath
those
palpitating
brows.
"I
am
sorry,"
said
he,
"that
Lady
Rossiter
is
not
here
to
help
me
to
welcome
you.
By
the
way,
Charles,
did
Evelyn
say
anything
about
the
date
of
her
return?"
"She
wished
to
stay
in
town
for
a
few
more
days,"
