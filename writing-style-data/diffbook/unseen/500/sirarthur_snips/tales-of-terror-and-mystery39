hour
has
passed."
As
they
stepped
out
into
the
darkness,
a
sheet
of
rain
was
driven
in
upon
their
faces,
and
the
hall
lamp,
which
dangled
from
the
arm
of
a
marble
Caryatid,
went
out
with
a
fluff.
Pim,
the
butler,
pushed
the
heavy
door
to,
straining
hard
with
his
shoulder
against
the
wind,
while
the
two
men
groped
their
way
towards
the
yellow
glare
which
showed
where
the
cab
was
waiting.
An
instant
later
they
were
rattling
upon
their
journey.
"Is
it
far?"
asked
Douglas
Stone.
"Oh,
no.
We
have
a
very
little
quiet
place
off
the
Euston
Road."
The
surgeon
pressed
the
spring
of
his
repeater
and
listened
to
the
little
tings
which
told
him
the
hour.
It
was
a
quarter
past
nine.
He
calculated
the
distances,
and
the
short
time
which
it
would
take
him
to
perform
so
trivial
an
operation.
He
ought
to
reach
Lady
Sannox
by
ten
o'clock.
Through
the
fogged
windows
he
saw
the
blurred
gas
lamps
dancing
past,
with
occasionally
the
broader
glare
of
a
shop
front.
The
rain
was
pelting
and
rattling
upon
the
leathern
top
of
the
carriage,
and
the
wheels
swashed
as
they
rolled
through
puddle
and
mud.
Opposite
to
him
the
white
headgear
of
his
companion
gleamed
faintly
through
the
obscurity.
The
surgeon
felt
in
his
pockets
and
arranged
his
needles,
his
ligatures
and
his
safety
pins,
that
no
time
might
be
wasted
when
they
arrived.
He
chafed
with
impatience
and
drummed
his
foot
upon
the
floor.
But
the
cab
slowed
down
at
last
and
pulled
up.
In
an
instant
Douglas
Stone
was
out,
and
the
Smyrna
merchant's
toe
was
at
his
very
heel.
"You
can
wait,"
said
he
to
the
driver.
It
was
a
mean
looking
house
in
a
narrow
and
sordid
street.
The
surgeon,
who
knew
his
London
well,
cast
a
swift
glance
into
the
shadows,
but
there
was
nothing
distinctive
no
shop,
no
movement,
nothing
but
a
double
line
of
dull,
flat
faced
houses,
a
double
stretch
of
wet
flagstones
which
gleamed
in
the
lamplight,
and
a
double
rush
of
water
in
the
gutters
which
swirled
and
gurgled
towards
the
sewer
gratings.
The
door
which
faced
them
was
blotched
and
discoloured,
and
a
faint
light
in
the
fan
pane
above,
it
served
to
show
the
dust
and
the
grime
which
covered
it.
Above
in
one
of
the
bedroom
windows,
there
was
a
dull
yellow
glimmer.
The
merchant
knocked
loudly,
and,
as
he
turned
his
dark
face
towards
the
light,
Douglas
Stone
could
see
that
it
was
contracted
with
anxiety.
A
bolt
was
drawn,
and
an
elderly
woman
with
a
taper
stood
in
the
doorway,
shielding
the
thin
flame
with
her
gnarled
hand.
"Is
all
well?"
gasped
the
merchant.
"She
is
as
you
left
her,
sir."
"She
has
not
spoken?"
"No,
she
is
in
a
deep
sleep."
The
merchant
closed
the
door,
and
Douglas
Stone
walked
down
the
narrow
passage,
glancing
about
him
in
some
surprise
as
he
did
so.
There
was
no
oil
cloth,
no
mat,
