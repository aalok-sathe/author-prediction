dangers
which
I
had
imagined.
"I
have
said
that
I
was
soaring
in
circles.
It
struck
me
suddenly
that
I
would
do
well
to
take
a
wider
sweep
and
open
up
a
new
airtract.
If
the
hunter
entered
an
earth
jungle
he
would
drive
through
it
if
he
wished
to
find
his
game.
My
reasoning
had
led
me
to
believe
that
the
air
jungle
which
I
had
imagined
lay
somewhere
over
Wiltshire.
This
should
be
to
the
south
and
west
of
me.
I
took
my
bearings
from
the
sun,
for
the
compass
was
hopeless
and
no
trace
of
earth
was
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
distant,
silver
cloud
plain.
However,
I
got
my
direction
as
best
I
might
and
kept
her
head
straight
to
the
mark.
I
reckoned
that
my
petrol
supply
would
not
last
for
more
than
another
hour
or
so,
but
I
could
afford
to
use
it
to
the
last
drop,
since
a
single
magnificent
vol
plane
could
at
any
time
take
me
to
the
earth.
"Suddenly
I
was
aware
of
something
new.
The
air
in
front
of
me
had
lost
its
crystal
clearness.
It
was
full
of
long,
ragged
wisps
of
something
which
I
can
only
compare
to
very
fine
cigarette
smoke.
It
hung
about
in
wreaths
and
coils,
turning
and
twisting
slowly
in
the
sunlight.
As
the
monoplane
shot
through
it,
I
was
aware
of
a
faint
taste
of
oil
upon
my
lips,
and
there
was
a
greasy
scum
upon
the
woodwork
of
the
machine.
Some
infinitely
fine
organic
matter
appeared
to
be
suspended
in
the
atmosphere.
There
was
no
life
there.
It
was
inchoate
and
diffuse,
extending
for
many
square
acres
and
then
fringing
off
into
the
void.
No,
it
was
not
life.
But
might
it
not
be
the
remains
of
life?
Above
all,
might
it
not
be
the
food
of
life,
of
monstrous
life,
even
as
the
humble
grease
of
the
ocean
is
the
food
for
the
mighty
whale?
The
thought
was
in
my
mind
when
my
eyes
looked
upwards
and
I
saw
the
most
wonderful
vision
that
ever
man
has
seen.
Can
I
hope
to
convey
it
to
you
even
as
I
saw
it
myself
last
Thursday?
"Conceive
a
jelly
fish
such
as
sails
in
our
summer
seas,
bell
shaped
and
of
enormous
size
far
larger,
I
should
judge,
than
the
dome
of
St.
Paul's.
It
was
of
a
light
pink
colour
veined
with
a
delicate
green,
but
the
whole
huge
fabric
so
tenuous
that
it
was
but
a
fairy
outline
against
the
dark
blue
sky.
It
pulsated
with
a
delicate
and
regular
rhythm.
From
it
there
depended
two
long,
drooping,
green
tentacles,
which
swayed
slowly
backwards
and
forwards.
This
gorgeous
vision
passed
gently
with
noiseless
dignity
over
my
head,
as
light
and
fragile
as
a
soap
bubble,
and
drifted
upon
its
stately
way.
"I
had
half
turned
my
monoplane,
that
I
might
look
after
this
beautiful
creature,
when,
in
a
moment,
I
found
myself
amidst
a
perfect
fleet
of
them,
of
