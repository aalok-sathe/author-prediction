the
ladder
of
success,
for
Lady
Rossiter
and
Lord
Linchmere
have
proved
to
be
staunch
friends,
and
they
have
never
forgotten
my
association
with
them
in
the
time
of
their
need.
Sir
Thomas
is
out
and
said
to
be
cured,
but
I
still
think
that
if
I
spent
another
night
at
Delamere
Court,
I
should
be
inclined
to
lock
my
door
upon
the
inside.
The
Man
with
the
Watches
There
are
many
who
will
still
bear
in
mind
the
singular
circumstances
which,
under
the
heading
of
the
Rugby
Mystery,
filled
many
columns
of
the
daily
Press
in
the
spring
of
the
year
1892.
Coming
as
it
did
at
a
period
of
exceptional
dullness,
it
attracted
perhaps
rather
more
attention
than
it
deserved,
but
it
offered
to
the
public
that
mixture
of
the
whimsical
and
the
tragic
which
is
most
stimulating
to
the
popular
imagination.
Interest
drooped,
however,
when,
after
weeks
of
fruitless
investigation,
it
was
found
that
no
final
explanation
of
the
facts
was
forthcoming,
and
the
tragedy
seemed
from
that
time
to
the
present
to
have
finally
taken
its
place
in
the
dark
catalogue
of
inexplicable
and
unexpiated
crimes.
A
recent
communication
(the
authenticity
of
which
appears
to
be
above
question)
has,
however,
thrown
some
new
and
clear
light
upon
the
matter.
Before
laying
it
before
the
public
it
would
be
as
well,
perhaps,
that
I
should
refresh
their
memories
as
to
the
singular
facts
upon
which
this
commentary
is
founded.
These
facts
were
briefly
as
follows:
At
five
o'clock
on
the
evening
of
the
18th
of
March
in
the
year
already
mentioned
a
train
left
Euston
Station
for
Manchester.
It
was
a
rainy,
squally
day,
which
grew
wilder
as
it
progressed,
so
it
was
by
no
means
the
weather
in
which
anyone
would
travel
who
was
not
driven
to
do
so
by
necessity.
The
train,
however,
is
a
favourite
one
among
Manchester
business
men
who
are
returning
from
town,
for
it
does
the
journey
in
four
hours
and
twenty
minutes,
with
only
three
stoppages
upon
the
way.
In
spite
of
the
inclement
evening
it
was,
therefore,
fairly
well
filled
upon
the
occasion
of
which
I
speak.
The
guard
of
the
train
was
a
tried
servant
of
the
company
a
man
who
had
worked
for
twenty
two
years
without
a
blemish
or
complaint.
His
name
was
John
Palmer.
The
station
clock
was
upon
the
stroke
of
five,
and
the
guard
was
about
to
give
the
customary
signal
to
the
engine
driver
when
he
observed
two
belated
passengers
hurrying
down
the
platform.
The
one
was
an
exceptionally
tall
man,
dressed
in
a
long
black
overcoat
with
astrakhan
collar
and
cuffs.
I
have
already
said
that
the
evening
was
an
inclement
one,
and
the
tall
traveller
had
the
high,
warm
collar
turned
up
to
protect
his
throat
against
the
bitter
March
wind.
He
appeared,
as
far
as
the
guard
could
judge
by
so
hurried
an
inspection,
to
be
a
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age,
who
had
retained
a
