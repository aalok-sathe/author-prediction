the
four
stones
with
the
aid
of
a
lens.
He
now
submitted
them
to
several
tests,
and
finally
turned
cheerfully
to
Mortimer.
"I
congratulate
you,
sir,"
said
he,
heartily.
"I
will
pledge
my
reputation
that
all
four
of
these
stones
are
genuine,
and
of
a
most
unusual
degree
of
purity."
The
colour
began
to
come
back
to
my
poor
friend's
frightened
face,
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief.
"Thank
God!"
he
cried.
"Then
what
in
the
world
did
the
thief
want?"
"Probably
he
meant
to
take
the
stones,
but
was
interrupted."
"In
that
case
one
would
expect
him
to
take
them
out
one
at
a
time,
but
the
setting
of
each
of
these
has
been
loosened,
and
yet
the
stones
are
all
here."
"It
is
certainly
most
extraordinary,"
said
the
inspector.
"I
never
remember
a
case
like
it.
Let
us
see
the
watchman."
The
commissionaire
was
called
a
soldierly,
honest
faced
man,
who
seemed
as
concerned
as
Ward
Mortimer
at
the
incident.
"No,
sir,
I
never
heard
a
sound,"
he
answered,
in
reply
to
the
questions
of
the
inspector.
"I
made
my
rounds
four
times,
as
usual,
but
I
saw
nothing
suspicious.
I've
been
in
my
position
ten
years,
but
nothing
of
the
kind
has
ever
occurred
before."
"No
thief
could
have
come
through
the
windows?"
"Impossible,
sir."
"Or
passed
you
at
the
door?"
"No,
sir;
I
never
left
my
post
except
when
I
walked
my
rounds."
"What
other
openings
are
there
in
the
museum?"
"There
is
the
door
into
Mr.
Ward
Mortimer's
private
rooms."
"That
is
locked
at
night,"
my
friend
explained,
"and
in
order
to
reach
it
anyone
from
the
street
would
have
to
open
the
outside
door
as
well."
"Your
servants?"
"Their
quarters
are
entirely
separate."
"Well,
well,"
said
the
inspector,
"this
is
certainly
very
obscure.
However,
there
has
been
no
harm
done,
according
to
Mr.
Purvis."
"I
will
swear
that
those
stones
are
genuine."
"So
that
the
case
appears
to
be
merely
one
of
malicious
damage.
But
none
the
less,
I
should
be
very
glad
to
go
carefully
round
the
premises,
and
to
see
if
we
can
find
any
trace
to
show
us
who
your
visitor
may
have
been."
His
investigation,
which
lasted
all
the
morning,
was
careful
and
intelligent,
but
it
led
in
the
end
to
nothing.
He
pointed
out
to
us
that
there
were
two
possible
entrances
to
the
museum
which
we
had
not
considered.
The
one
was
from
the
cellars
by
a
trap
door
opening
in
the
passage.
The
other
through
a
skylight
from
the
lumber
room,
overlooking
that
very
chamber
to
which
the
intruder
had
penetrated.
As
neither
the
cellar
nor
the
lumber
room
could
be
entered
unless
the
thief
was
already
within
the
locked
doors,
the
matter
was
not
of
any
practical
importance,
and
the
dust
of
cellar
and
attic
assured
us
that
no
one
had
used
either
one
or
the
other.
Finally,
we
ended
as
we
began,
without
the
slightest
clue
as
to
how,
why,
or
by
whom
