the
scene
of
his
success.
Such
was
the
position
of
affairs
when,
upon
the
evening
of
Monday,
June
21st,
there
came
a
fresh
development
which
changed
what
had
been
a
mere
village
scandal
into
a
tragedy
which
arrested
the
attention
of
the
whole
nation.
Some
detail
is
necessary
to
cause
the
facts
of
that
evening
to
present
their
full
significance.
The
sole
occupants
of
the
doctor's
house
were
his
housekeeper,
an
elderly
and
most
respectable
woman,
named
Martha
Woods,
and
a
young
servant
Mary
Pilling.
The
coachman
and
the
surgery
boy
slept
out.
It
was
the
custom
of
the
doctor
to
sit
at
night
in
his
study,
which
was
next
the
surgery
in
the
wing
of
the
house
which
was
farthest
from
the
servants'
quarters.
This
side
of
the
house
had
a
door
of
its
own
for
the
convenience
of
patients,
so
that
it
was
possible
for
the
doctor
to
admit
and
receive
a
visitor
there
without
the
knowledge
of
anyone.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
when
patients
came
late
it
was
quite
usual
for
him
to
let
them
in
and
out
by
the
surgery
entrance,
for
the
maid
and
the
housekeeper
were
in
the
habit
of
retiring
early.
On
this
particular
night
Martha
Woods
went
into
the
doctor's
study
at
half
past
nine,
and
found
him
writing
at
his
desk.
She
bade
him
good
night,
sent
the
maid
to
bed,
and
then
occupied
herself
until
a
quarter
to
eleven
in
household
matters.
It
was
striking
eleven
upon
the
hall
clock
when
she
went
to
her
own
room.
She
had
been
there
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
when
she
heard
a
cry
or
call,
which
appeared
to
come
from
within
the
house.
She
waited
some
time,
but
it
was
not
repeated.
Much
alarmed,
for
the
sound
was
loud
and
urgent,
she
put
on
a
dressing
gown,
and
ran
at
the
top
of
her
speed
to
the
doctor's
study.
"Who's
there?"
cried
a
voice,
as
she
tapped
at
the
door.
"I
am
here,
sir
Mrs.
Woods."
"I
beg
that
you
will
leave
me
in
peace.
Go
back
to
your
room
this
instant!"
cried
the
voice,
which
was,
to
the
best
of
her
belief,
that
of
her
master.
The
tone
was
so
harsh
and
so
unlike
her
master's
usual
manner,
that
she
was
surprised
and
hurt.
"I
thought
I
heard
you
calling,
sir,"
she
explained,
but
no
answer
was
given
to
her.
Mrs.
Woods
looked
at
the
clock
as
she
returned
to
her
room,
and
it
was
then
half
past
eleven.
At
some
period
between
eleven
and
twelve
(she
could
not
be
positive
as
to
the
exact
hour)
a
patient
called
upon
the
doctor
and
was
unable
to
get
any
reply
from
him.
This
late
visitor
was
Mrs.
Madding,
the
wife
of
the
village
grocer,
who
was
dangerously
ill
of
typhoid
fever.
Dr.
Lana
had
asked
her
to
look
in
the
last
thing
and
let
him
know
how
her
husband
was
progressing.
She
observed
that
the
light
was
