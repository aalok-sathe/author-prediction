in
the
Capitol.
There
are,
as
you
see,
twelve
magnificent
stones,
inscribed
with
mystical
characters.
Counting
from
the
left
hand
top
corner,
the
stones
are
carnelian,
peridot,
emerald,
ruby,
lapis
lazuli,
onyx,
sapphire,
agate,
amethyst,
topaz,
beryl,
and
jasper."
I
was
amazed
at
the
variety
and
beauty
of
the
stones.
"Has
the
breastplate
any
particular
history?"
I
asked.
"It
is
of
great
age
and
of
immense
value,"
said
Professor
Andreas.
"Without
being
able
to
make
an
absolute
assertion,
we
have
many
reasons
to
think
that
it
is
possible
that
it
may
be
the
original
urim
and
thummim
of
Solomon's
Temple.
There
is
certainly
nothing
so
fine
in
any
collection
in
Europe.
My
friend,
Captain
Wilson,
here,
is
a
practical
authority
upon
precious
stones,
and
he
would
tell
you
how
pure
these
are."
Captain
Wilson,
a
man
with
a
dark,
hard,
incisive
face,
was
standing
beside
his
fiancee
at
the
other
side
of
the
case.
"Yes,"
said
he,
curtly,
"I
have
never
seen
finer
stones."
"And
the
gold
work
is
also
worthy
of
attention.
The
ancients
excelled
in
"
he
was
apparently
about
to
indicate
the
setting
of
the
stones,
when
Captain
Wilson
interrupted
him.
"You
will
see
a
finer
example
of
their
gold
work
in
this
candlestick,"
said
he,
turning
to
another
table,
and
we
all
joined
him
in
his
admiration
of
its
embossed
stem
and
delicately
ornamented
branches.
Altogether
it
was
an
interesting
and
a
novel
experience
to
have
objects
of
such
rarity
explained
by
so
great
an
expert;
and
when,
finally,
Professor
Andreas
finished
our
inspection
by
formally
handing
over
the
precious
collection
to
the
care
of
my
friend,
I
could
not
help
pitying
him
and
envying
his
successor
whose
life
was
to
pass
in
so
pleasant
a
duty.
Within
a
week,
Ward
Mortimer
was
duly
installed
in
his
new
set
of
rooms,
and
had
become
the
autocrat
of
the
Belmore
Street
Museum.
About
a
fortnight
afterwards
my
friend
gave
a
small
dinner
to
half
a
dozen
bachelor
friends
to
celebrate
his
promotion.
When
his
guests
were
departing
he
pulled
my
sleeve
and
signalled
to
me
that
he
wished
me
to
remain.
"You
have
only
a
few
hundred
yards
to
go,"
said
he
I
was
living
in
chambers
in
the
Albany.
"You
may
as
well
stay
and
have
a
quiet
cigar
with
me.
I
very
much
want
your
advice."
I
relapsed
into
an
arm
chair
and
lit
one
of
his
excellent
Matronas.
When
he
had
returned
from
seeing
the
last
of
his
guests
out,
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
dress
jacket
and
sat
down
opposite
to
me.
"This
is
an
anonymous
letter
which
I
received
this
morning,"
said
he.
"I
want
to
read
it
to
you
and
to
have
your
advice."
"You
are
very
welcome
to
it
for
what
it
is
worth."
"This
is
how
the
note
runs:
'Sir,
I
should
strongly
advise
you
to
keep
a
very
careful
watch
over
the
many
valuable
things
which
are
committed
to
your
charge.
I
do
not
think
that
