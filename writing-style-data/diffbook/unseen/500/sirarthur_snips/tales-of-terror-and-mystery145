reason
to
think
that
he
will
return
tonight
and
complete
the
job."
"Excellent!"
I
cried.
"We
will
keep
our
own
secret,
and
say
nothing
either
to
the
police
or
to
Simpson.
Will
you
join
me?"
"With
the
utmost
pleasure,"
said
I;
and
so
it
was
agreed.
It
was
ten
o'clock
that
night
when
I
returned
to
the
Belmore
Street
Museum.
Mortimer
was,
as
I
could
see,
in
a
state
of
suppressed
nervous
excitement,
but
it
was
still
too
early
to
begin
our
vigil,
so
we
remained
for
an
hour
or
so
in
his
chambers,
discussing
all
the
possibilities
of
the
singular
business
which
we
had
met
to
solve.
At
last
the
roaring
stream
of
hansom
cabs
and
the
rush
of
hurrying
feet
became
lower
and
more
intermittent
as
the
pleasure
seekers
passed
on
their
way
to
their
stations
or
their
homes.
It
was
nearly
twelve
when
Mortimer
led
the
way
to
the
lumber
room
which
overlooked
the
central
hall
of
the
museum.
He
had
visited
it
during
the
day,
and
had
spread
some
sacking
so
that
we
could
lie
at
our
ease,
and
look
straight
down
into
the
museum.
The
skylight
was
of
unfrosted
glass,
but
was
so
covered
with
dust
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
looking
up
from
below
to
detect
that
he
was
overlooked.
We
cleared
a
small
piece
at
each
corner,
which
gave
us
a
complete
view
of
the
room
beneath
us.
In
the
cold
white
light
of
the
electric
lamps
everything
stood
out
hard
and
clear,
and
I
could
see
the
smallest
detail
of
the
contents
of
the
various
cases.
Such
a
vigil
is
an
excellent
lesson,
since
one
has
no
choice
but
to
look
hard
at
those
objects
which
we
usually
pass
with
such
half
hearted
interest.
Through
my
little
peep
hole
I
employed
the
hours
in
studying
every
specimen,
from
the
huge
mummy
case
which
leaned
against
the
wall
to
those
very
jewels
which
had
brought
us
there,
gleaming
and
sparkling
in
their
glass
case
immediately
beneath
us.
There
was
much
precious
gold
work
and
many
valuable
stones
scattered
through
the
numerous
cases,
but
those
wonderful
twelve
which
made
up
the
urim
and
thummim
glowed
and
burned
with
a
radiance
which
far
eclipsed
the
others.
I
studied
in
turn
the
tomb
pictures
of
Sicara,
the
friezes
from
Karnak,
the
statues
of
Memphis,
and
the
inscriptions
of
Thebes,
but
my
eyes
would
always
come
back
to
that
wonderful
Jewish
relic,
and
my
mind
to
the
singular
mystery
which
surrounded
it.
I
was
lost
in
the
thought
of
it
when
my
companion
suddenly
drew
his
breath
sharply
in,
and
seized
my
arm
in
a
convulsive
grip.
At
the
same
instant
I
saw
what
it
was
which
had
excited
him.
I
have
said
that
against
the
wall
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
doorway
(the
right
hand
side
as
we
looked
at
it,
but
the
left
as
one
entered)
there
stood
a
large
mummy
case.
To
our
unutterable
amazement
it
was
slowly
opening.
Gradually,
