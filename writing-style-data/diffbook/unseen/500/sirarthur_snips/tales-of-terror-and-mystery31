cow
house,
and
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket.
"Surely
your
catacomb
is
not
inside
a
house!"
cried
Kennedy.
"The
entrance
to
it
is.
That
is
just
the
safeguard
which
we
have
against
anyone
else
discovering
it."
"Does
the
proprietor
know
of
it?"
"Not
he.
He
had
found
one
or
two
objects
which
made
me
almost
certain
that
his
house
was
built
on
the
entrance
to
such
a
place.
So
I
rented
it
from
him,
and
did
my
excavations
for
myself.
Come
in,
and
shut
the
door
behind
you."
It
was
a
long,
empty
building,
with
the
mangers
of
the
cows
along
one
wall.
Burger
put
his
lantern
down
on
the
ground,
and
shaded
its
light
in
all
directions
save
one
by
draping
his
overcoat
round
it.
"It
might
excite
remark
if
anyone
saw
a
light
in
this
lonely
place,"
said
he.
"Just
help
me
to
move
this
boarding."
The
flooring
was
loose
in
the
corner,
and
plank
by
plank
the
two
savants
raised
it
and
leaned
it
against
the
wall.
Below
there
was
a
square
aperture
and
a
stair
of
old
stone
steps
which
led
away
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth.
"Be
careful!"
cried
Burger,
as
Kennedy,
in
his
impatience,
hurried
down
them.
"It
is
a
perfect
rabbits'
warren
below,
and
if
you
were
once
to
lose
your
way
there
the
chances
would
be
a
hundred
to
one
against
your
ever
coming
out
again.
Wait
until
I
bring
the
light."
"How
do
you
find
your
own
way
if
it
is
so
complicated?"
"I
had
some
very
narrow
escapes
at
first,
but
I
have
gradually
learned
to
go
about.
There
is
a
certain
system
to
it,
but
it
is
one
which
a
lost
man,
if
he
were
in
the
dark,
could
not
possibly
find
out.
Even
now
I
always
spin
out
a
ball
of
string
behind
me
when
I
am
going
far
into
the
catacomb.
You
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
is
difficult,
but
every
one
of
these
passages
divides
and
subdivides
a
dozen
times
before
you
go
a
hundred
yards."
They
had
descended
some
twenty
feet
from
the
level
of
the
byre,
and
they
were
standing
now
in
a
square
chamber
cut
out
of
the
soft
tufa.
The
lantern
cast
a
flickering
light,
bright
below
and
dim
above,
over
the
cracked
brown
walls.
In
every
direction
were
the
black
openings
of
passages
which
radiated
from
this
common
centre.
"I
want
you
to
follow
me
closely,
my
friend,"
said
Burger.
"Do
not
loiter
to
look
at
anything
upon
the
way,
for
the
place
to
which
I
will
take
you
contains
all
that
you
can
see,
and
more.
It
will
save
time
for
us
to
go
there
direct."
He
led
the
way
down
one
of
the
corridors,
and
the
Englishman
followed
closely
at
his
heels.
Every
now
and
then
the
passage
bifurcated,
but
Burger
was
evidently
following
some
secret
marks
of
his
own,
for
he
neither
stopped
nor
hesitated.
Everywhere
along
the
walls,
packed
like
the
berths
