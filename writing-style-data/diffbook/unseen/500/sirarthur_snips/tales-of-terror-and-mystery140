present
system
of
a
single
watchman
is
sufficient.
Be
upon
your
guard,
or
an
irreparable
misfortune
may
occur.'"
"Is
that
all?"
"Yes,
that
is
all."
"Well,"
said
I,
"it
is
at
least
obvious
that
it
was
written
by
one
of
the
limited
number
of
people
who
are
aware
that
you
have
only
one
watchman
at
night."
Ward
Mortimer
handed
me
the
note,
with
a
curious
smile.
"Have
you
an
eye
for
handwriting?"
said
he.
"Now,
look
at
this!"
He
put
another
letter
in
front
of
me.
"Look
at
the
c
in
'congratulate'
and
the
c
in
'committed.'
Look
at
the
capital
I.
Look
at
the
trick
of
putting
in
a
dash
instead
of
a
stop!"
"They
are
undoubtedly
from
the
same
hand
with
some
attempt
at
disguise
in
the
case
of
this
first
one."
"The
second,"
said
Ward
Mortimer,
"is
the
letter
of
congratulation
which
was
written
to
me
by
Professor
Andreas
upon
my
obtaining
my
appointment."
I
stared
at
him
in
amazement.
Then
I
turned
over
the
letter
in
my
hand,
and
there,
sure
enough,
was
"Martin
Andreas"
signed
upon
the
other
side.
There
could
be
no
doubt,
in
the
mind
of
anyone
who
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
science
of
graphology,
that
the
Professor
had
written
an
anonymous
letter,
warning
his
successor
against
thieves.
It
was
inexplicable,
but
it
was
certain.
"Why
should
he
do
it?"
I
asked.
"Precisely
what
I
should
wish
to
ask
you.
If
he
had
any
such
misgivings,
why
could
he
not
come
and
tell
me
direct?"
"Will
you
speak
to
him
about
it?"
"There
again
I
am
in
doubt.
He
might
choose
to
deny
that
he
wrote
it."
"At
any
rate,"
said
I,
"this
warning
is
meant
in
a
friendly
spirit,
and
I
should
certainly
act
upon
it.
Are
the
present
precautions
enough
to
insure
you
against
robbery?"
"I
should
have
thought
so.
The
public
are
only
admitted
from
ten
till
five,
and
there
is
a
guardian
to
every
two
rooms.
He
stands
at
the
door
between
them,
and
so
commands
them
both."
"But
at
night?"
"When
the
public
are
gone,
we
at
once
put
up
the
great
iron
shutters,
which
are
absolutely
burglar
proof.
The
watchman
is
a
capable
fellow.
He
sits
in
the
lodge,
but
he
walks
round
every
three
hours.
We
keep
one
electric
light
burning
in
each
room
all
night."
"It
is
difficult
to
suggest
anything
more
short
of
keeping
your
day
watches
all
night."
"We
could
not
afford
that."
"At
least,
I
should
communicate
with
the
police,
and
have
a
special
constable
put
on
outside
in
Belmore
Street,"
said
I.
"As
to
the
letter,
if
the
writer
wishes
to
be
anonymous,
I
think
he
has
a
right
to
remain
so.
We
must
trust
to
the
future
to
show
some
reason
for
the
curious
course
which
he
has
adopted."
So
we
dismissed
the
subject,
but
all
that
night
after
my
return
to
my
chambers
I
was
puzzling
my
brain
as
to
what
possible
motive
Professor
Andreas
could
have
