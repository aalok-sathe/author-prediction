judge
for
yourself
whether
I
have
solved
the
riddle
or
not.
"'The
prisoner
was
brought
before
the
Grand
Chambers
and
Tournelles
of
Parliament,
sitting
as
a
court
of
justice,
charged
with
the
murder
of
Master
Dreux
d'Aubray,
her
father,
and
of
her
two
brothers,
MM.
d'Aubray,
one
being
civil
lieutenant,
and
the
other
a
counsellor
of
Parliament.
In
person
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
that
she
had
really
done
such
wicked
deeds,
for
she
was
of
a
mild
appearance,
and
of
short
stature,
with
a
fair
skin
and
blue
eyes.
Yet
the
Court,
having
found
her
guilty,
condemned
her
to
the
ordinary
and
to
the
extraordinary
question
in
order
that
she
might
be
forced
to
name
her
accomplices,
after
which
she
should
be
carried
in
a
cart
to
the
Place
de
Greve,
there
to
have
her
head
cut
off,
her
body
being
afterwards
burned
and
her
ashes
scattered
to
the
winds.'
"The
date
of
this
entry
is
July
16,
1676."
"It
is
interesting,"
said
I,
"but
not
convincing.
How
do
you
prove
the
two
women
to
be
the
same?"
"I
am
coming
to
that.
The
narrative
goes
on
to
tell
of
the
woman's
behaviour
when
questioned.
'When
the
executioner
approached
her
she
recognized
him
by
the
cords
which
he
held
in
his
hands,
and
she
at
once
held
out
her
own
hands
to
him,
looking
at
him
from
head
to
foot
without
uttering
a
word.'
How's
that?"
"Yes,
it
was
so."
"'She
gazed
without
wincing
upon
the
wooden
horse
and
rings
which
had
twisted
so
many
limbs
and
caused
so
many
shrieks
of
agony.
When
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
three
pails
of
water,
which
were
all
ready
for
her,
she
said
with
a
smile,
"All
that
water
must
have
been
brought
here
for
the
purpose
of
drowning
me,
Monsieur.
You
have
no
idea,
I
trust,
of
making
a
person
of
my
small
stature
swallow
it
all."'
Shall
I
read
the
details
of
the
torture?"
"No,
for
Heaven's
sake,
don't."
"Here
is
a
sentence
which
must
surely
show
you
that
what
is
here
recorded
is
the
very
scene
which
you
have
gazed
upon
tonight:
'The
good
Abbe
Pirot,
unable
to
contemplate
the
agonies
which
were
suffered
by
his
penitent,
had
hurried
from
the
room.'
Does
that
convince
you?"
"It
does
entirely.
There
can
be
no
question
that
it
is
indeed
the
same
event.
But
who,
then,
is
this
lady
whose
appearance
was
so
attractive
and
whose
end
was
so
horrible?"
For
answer
Dacre
came
across
to
me,
and
placed
the
small
lamp
upon
the
table
which
stood
by
my
bed.
Lifting
up
the
ill
omened
filler,
he
turned
the
brass
rim
so
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
it.
Seen
in
this
way
the
engraving
seemed
clearer
than
on
the
night
before.
"We
have
already
agreed
that
this
is
the
badge
of
a
marquis
or
of
a
marquise,"
said
he.
"We
have
also
settled
that
the
last
letter
is
B."
"It
is
undoubtedly
so."
"I
now
suggest
to
you
that
