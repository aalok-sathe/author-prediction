but
when
he
does
he
will
be
a
terror.
At
present
he
won't
stand
anyone
but
me
in
his
den.
Even
Baldwin,
the
groom,
dare
not
go
near
him.
As
to
me,
I
am
his
mother
and
father
in
one."
As
he
spoke
he
suddenly,
to
my
astonishment,
opened
the
door
and
slipped
in,
closing
it
instantly
behind
him.
At
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
huge,
lithe
creature
rose,
yawned
and
rubbed
its
round,
black
head
affectionately
against
his
side,
while
he
patted
and
fondled
it.
"Now,
Tommy,
into
your
cage!"
said
he.
The
monstrous
cat
walked
over
to
one
side
of
the
room
and
coiled
itself
up
under
a
grating.
Everard
King
came
out,
and
taking
the
iron
handle
which
I
have
mentioned,
he
began
to
turn
it.
As
he
did
so
the
line
of
bars
in
the
corridor
began
to
pass
through
a
slot
in
the
wall
and
closed
up
the
front
of
this
grating,
so
as
to
make
an
effective
cage.
When
it
was
in
position
he
opened
the
door
once
more
and
invited
me
into
the
room,
which
was
heavy
with
the
pungent,
musty
smell
peculiar
to
the
great
carnivora.
"That's
how
we
work
it,"
said
he.
"We
give
him
the
run
of
the
room
for
exercise,
and
then
at
night
we
put
him
in
his
cage.
You
can
let
him
out
by
turning
the
handle
from
the
passage,
or
you
can,
as
you
have
seen,
coop
him
up
in
the
same
way.
No,
no,
you
should
not
do
that!"
I
had
put
my
hand
between
the
bars
to
pat
the
glossy,
heaving
flank.
He
pulled
it
back,
with
a
serious
face.
"I
assure
you
that
he
is
not
safe.
Don't
imagine
that
because
I
can
take
liberties
with
him
anyone
else
can.
He
is
very
exclusive
in
his
friends
aren't
you,
Tommy?
Ah,
he
hears
his
lunch
coming
to
him!
Don't
you,
boy?"
A
step
sounded
in
the
stone
flagged
passage,
and
the
creature
had
sprung
to
his
feet,
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
narrow
cage,
his
yellow
eyes
gleaming,
and
his
scarlet
tongue
rippling
and
quivering
over
the
white
line
of
his
jagged
teeth.
A
groom
entered
with
a
coarse
joint
upon
a
tray,
and
thrust
it
through
the
bars
to
him.
He
pounced
lightly
upon
it,
carried
it
off
to
the
corner,
and
there,
holding
it
between
his
paws,
tore
and
wrenched
at
it,
raising
his
bloody
muzzle
every
now
and
then
to
look
at
us.
It
was
a
malignant
and
yet
fascinating
sight.
"You
can't
wonder
that
I
am
fond
of
him,
can
you?"
said
my
host,
as
we
left
the
room,
"especially
when
you
consider
that
I
have
had
the
rearing
of
him.
It
was
no
joke
bringing
him
over
from
the
centre
of
South
America;
but
here
he
is
safe
and
sound
and,
as
I
have
said,
far
the
most
perfect
specimen
in
Europe.
The
people
at
the
Zoo
are
dying
to
have
him,
but
I
really
