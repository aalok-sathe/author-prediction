it
was
now
his
business,
his
room,
his
to
command.
He
carried
a
coil
of
light
ropes
over
his
left
forearm.
The
lady
looked
him
up
and
down
with
a
searching
glance,
but
her
expression
was
unchanged.
It
was
confident
even
defiant.
But
it
was
very
different
with
the
priest.
His
face
was
ghastly
white,
and
I
saw
the
moisture
glisten
and
run
on
his
high,
sloping
forehead.
He
threw
up
his
hands
in
prayer
and
he
stooped
continually
to
mutter
frantic
words
in
the
lady's
ear.
The
man
in
black
now
advanced,
and
taking
one
of
the
cords
from
his
left
arm,
he
bound
the
woman's
hands
together.
She
held
them
meekly
toward
him
as
he
did
so.
Then
he
took
her
arm
with
a
rough
grip
and
led
her
toward
the
wooden
horse,
which
was
little
higher
than
her
waist.
On
to
this
she
was
lifted
and
laid,
with
her
back
upon
it,
and
her
face
to
the
ceiling,
while
the
priest,
quivering
with
horror,
had
rushed
out
of
the
room.
The
woman's
lips
were
moving
rapidly,
and
though
I
could
hear
nothing
I
knew
that
she
was
praying.
Her
feet
hung
down
on
either
side
of
the
horse,
and
I
saw
that
the
rough
varlets
in
attendance
had
fastened
cords
to
her
ankles
and
secured
the
other
ends
to
iron
rings
in
the
stone
floor.
My
heart
sank
within
me
as
I
saw
these
ominous
preparations,
and
yet
I
was
held
by
the
fascination
of
horror,
and
I
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
strange
spectacle.
A
man
had
entered
the
room
with
a
bucket
of
water
in
either
hand.
Another
followed
with
a
third
bucket.
They
were
laid
beside
the
wooden
horse.
The
second
man
had
a
wooden
dipper
a
bowl
with
a
straight
handle
in
his
other
hand.
This
he
gave
to
the
man
in
black.
At
the
same
moment
one
of
the
varlets
approached
with
a
dark
object
in
his
hand,
which
even
in
my
dream
filled
me
with
a
vague
feeling
of
familiarity.
It
was
a
leathern
filler.
With
horrible
energy
he
thrust
it
but
I
could
stand
no
more.
My
hair
stood
on
end
with
horror.
I
writhed,
I
struggled,
I
broke
through
the
bonds
of
sleep,
and
I
burst
with
a
shriek
into
my
own
life,
and
found
myself
lying
shivering
with
terror
in
the
huge
library,
with
the
moonlight
flooding
through
the
window
and
throwing
strange
silver
and
black
traceries
upon
the
opposite
wall.
Oh,
what
a
blessed
relief
to
feel
that
I
was
back
in
the
nineteenth
century
back
out
of
that
mediaeval
vault
into
a
world
where
men
had
human
hearts
within
their
bosoms.
I
sat
up
on
my
couch,
trembling
in
every
limb,
my
mind
divided
between
thankfulness
and
horror.
To
think
that
such
things
were
ever
done
that
they
could
be
done
without
God
striking
the
villains
dead.
Was
it
all
a
fantasy,
or
did
it
really
stand
for
something
which
had
happened
in
the
