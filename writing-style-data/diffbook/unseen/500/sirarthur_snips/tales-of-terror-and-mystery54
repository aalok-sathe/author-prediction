my
cost
that
it
was
also
very
cunning.
I
had
imagined
that
it
was
in
panic
flight,
and
that
I
had
only
to
pursue
it.
The
idea
that
it
might
turn
upon
me
never
entered
my
excited
brain.
I
have
already
explained
that
the
passage
down
which
I
was
racing
opened
into
a
great
central
cave.
Into
this
I
rushed,
fearful
lest
I
should
lose
all
trace
of
the
beast.
But
he
had
turned
upon
his
own
traces,
and
in
a
moment
we
were
face
to
face.
That
picture,
seen
in
the
brilliant
white
light
of
the
lantern,
is
etched
for
ever
upon
my
brain.
He
had
reared
up
on
his
hind
legs
as
a
bear
would
do,
and
stood
above
me,
enormous,
menacing
such
a
creature
as
no
nightmare
had
ever
brought
to
my
imagination.
I
have
said
that
he
reared
like
a
bear,
and
there
was
something
bear
like
if
one
could
conceive
a
bear
which
was
ten
fold
the
bulk
of
any
bear
seen
upon
earth
in
his
whole
pose
and
attitude,
in
his
great
crooked
forelegs
with
their
ivory
white
claws,
in
his
rugged
skin,
and
in
his
red,
gaping
mouth,
fringed
with
monstrous
fangs.
Only
in
one
point
did
he
differ
from
the
bear,
or
from
any
other
creature
which
walks
the
earth,
and
even
at
that
supreme
moment
a
shudder
of
horror
passed
over
me
as
I
observed
that
the
eyes
which
glistened
in
the
glow
of
my
lantern
were
huge,
projecting
bulbs,
white
and
sightless.
For
a
moment
his
great
paws
swung
over
my
head.
The
next
he
fell
forward
upon
me,
I
and
my
broken
lantern
crashed
to
the
earth,
and
I
remember
no
more.
When
I
came
to
myself
I
was
back
in
the
farm
house
of
the
Allertons.
Two
days
had
passed
since
my
terrible
adventure
in
the
Blue
John
Gap.
It
seems
that
I
had
lain
all
night
in
the
cave
insensible
from
concussion
of
the
brain,
with
my
left
arm
and
two
ribs
badly
fractured.
In
the
morning
my
note
had
been
found,
a
search
party
of
a
dozen
farmers
assembled,
and
I
had
been
tracked
down
and
carried
back
to
my
bedroom,
where
I
had
lain
in
high
delirium
ever
since.
There
was,
it
seems,
no
sign
of
the
creature,
and
no
bloodstain
which
would
show
that
my
bullet
had
found
him
as
he
passed.
Save
for
my
own
plight
and
the
marks
upon
the
mud,
there
was
nothing
to
prove
that
what
I
said
was
true.
Six
weeks
have
now
elapsed,
and
I
am
able
to
sit
out
once
more
in
the
sunshine.
Just
opposite
me
is
the
steep
hillside,
grey
with
shaly
rock,
and
yonder
on
its
flank
is
the
dark
cleft
which
marks
the
opening
of
the
Blue
John
Gap.
But
it
is
no
longer
a
source
of
terror.
Never
again
through
that
ill
omened
tunnel
shall
any
strange
shape
flit
out
into
the
world
of
men.
