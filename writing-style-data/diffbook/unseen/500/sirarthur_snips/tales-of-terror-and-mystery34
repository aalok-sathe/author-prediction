the
round
of
the
European
Press:
"One
of
the
most
interesting
discoveries
of
recent
years
is
that
of
the
new
catacomb
in
Rome,
which
lies
some
distance
to
the
east
of
the
well
known
vaults
of
St.
Calixtus.
The
finding
of
this
important
burial
place,
which
is
exceeding
rich
in
most
interesting
early
Christian
remains,
is
due
to
the
energy
and
sagacity
of
Dr.
Julius
Burger,
the
young
German
specialist,
who
is
rapidly
taking
the
first
place
as
an
authority
upon
ancient
Rome.
Although
the
first
to
publish
his
discovery,
it
appears
that
a
less
fortunate
adventurer
had
anticipated
Dr.
Burger.
Some
months
ago
Mr.
Kennedy,
the
well
known
English
student,
disappeared
suddenly
from
his
rooms
in
the
Corso,
and
it
was
conjectured
that
his
association
with
a
recent
scandal
had
driven
him
to
leave
Rome.
It
appears
now
that
he
had
in
reality
fallen
a
victim
to
that
fervid
love
of
archaeology
which
had
raised
him
to
a
distinguished
place
among
living
scholars.
His
body
was
discovered
in
the
heart
of
the
new
catacomb,
and
it
was
evident
from
the
condition
of
his
feet
and
boots
that
he
had
tramped
for
days
through
the
tortuous
corridors
which
make
these
subterranean
tombs
so
dangerous
to
explorers.
The
deceased
gentleman
had,
with
inexplicable
rashness,
made
his
way
into
this
labyrinth
without,
as
far
as
can
be
discovered,
taking
with
him
either
candles
or
matches,
so
that
his
sad
fate
was
the
natural
result
of
his
own
temerity.
What
makes
the
matter
more
painful
is
that
Dr.
Julius
Burger
was
an
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased.
His
joy
at
the
extraordinary
find
which
he
has
been
so
fortunate
as
to
make
has
been
greatly
marred
by
the
terrible
fate
of
his
comrade
and
fellow
worker."
The
Case
of
Lady
Sannox
The
relations
between
Douglas
Stone
and
the
notorious
Lady
Sannox
were
very
well
known
both
among
the
fashionable
circles
of
which
she
was
a
brilliant
member,
and
the
scientific
bodies
which
numbered
him
among
their
most
illustrious
confreres.
There
was
naturally,
therefore,
a
very
widespread
interest
when
it
was
announced
one
morning
that
the
lady
had
absolutely
and
for
ever
taken
the
veil,
and
that
the
world
would
see
her
no
more.
When,
at
the
very
tail
of
this
rumour,
there
came
the
assurance
that
the
celebrated
operating
surgeon,
the
man
of
steel
nerves,
had
been
found
in
the
morning
by
his
valet,
seated
on
one
side
of
his
bed,
smiling
pleasantly
upon
the
universe,
with
both
legs
jammed
into
one
side
of
his
breeches
and
his
great
brain
about
as
valuable
as
a
cap
full
of
porridge,
the
matter
was
strong
enough
to
give
quite
a
little
thrill
of
interest
to
folk
who
had
never
hoped
that
their
jaded
nerves
were
capable
of
such
a
sensation.
Douglas
Stone
in
his
prime
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
England.
Indeed,
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
ever
reached
his
prime,
for
he
was
but
nine
and
thirty
at
the
