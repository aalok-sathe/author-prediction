which
would
have
struck
me
passed
through
the
heart
of
my
unfortunate
brother.
"He
dropped
without
a
groan
upon
the
floor
of
the
compartment,
and
MacCoy
and
I,
equally
horrified,
knelt
at
each
side
of
him,
trying
to
bring
back
some
signs
of
life.
MacCoy
still
held
the
loaded
revolver
in
his
hand,
but
his
anger
against
me
and
my
resentment
towards
him
had
both
for
the
moment
been
swallowed
up
in
this
sudden
tragedy.
It
was
he
who
first
realized
the
situation.
The
train
was
for
some
reason
going
very
slowly
at
the
moment,
and
he
saw
his
opportunity
for
escape.
In
an
instant
he
had
the
door
open,
but
I
was
as
quick
as
he,
and
jumping
upon
him
the
two
of
us
fell
off
the
footboard
and
rolled
in
each
other's
arms
down
a
steep
embankment.
At
the
bottom
I
struck
my
head
against
a
stone,
and
I
remembered
nothing
more.
When
I
came
to
myself
I
was
lying
among
some
low
bushes,
not
far
from
the
railroad
track,
and
somebody
was
bathing
my
head
with
a
wet
handkerchief.
It
was
Sparrow
MacCoy.
"'I
guess
I
couldn't
leave
you,'
said
he.
'I
didn't
want
to
have
the
blood
of
two
of
you
on
my
hands
in
one
day.
You
loved
your
brother,
I've
no
doubt;
but
you
didn't
love
him
a
cent
more
than
I
loved
him,
though
you'll
say
that
I
took
a
queer
way
to
show
it.
Anyhow,
it
seems
a
mighty
empty
world
now
that
he
is
gone,
and
I
don't
care
a
continental
whether
you
give
me
over
to
the
hangman
or
not.'
"He
had
turned
his
ankle
in
the
fall,
and
there
we
sat,
he
with
his
useless
foot,
and
I
with
my
throbbing
head,
and
we
talked
and
talked
until
gradually
my
bitterness
began
to
soften
and
to
turn
into
something
like
sympathy.
What
was
the
use
of
revenging
his
death
upon
a
man
who
was
as
much
stricken
by
that
death
as
I
was?
And
then,
as
my
wits
gradually
returned,
I
began
to
realize
also
that
I
could
do
nothing
against
MacCoy
which
would
not
recoil
upon
my
mother
and
myself.
How
could
we
convict
him
without
a
full
account
of
my
brother's
career
being
made
public
the
very
thing
which
of
all
others
we
wished
to
avoid?
It
was
really
as
much
our
interest
as
his
to
cover
the
matter
up,
and
from
being
an
avenger
of
crime
I
found
myself
changed
to
a
conspirator
against
Justice.
The
place
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
one
of
those
pheasant
preserves
which
are
so
common
in
the
Old
Country,
and
as
we
groped
our
way
through
it
I
found
myself
consulting
the
slayer
of
my
brother
as
to
how
far
it
would
be
possible
to
hush
it
up.
"I
soon
realized
from
what
he
said
that
unless
there
were
some
papers
of
which
we
knew
nothing
in
my
brother's
pockets,
there
was
really
no
possible
means
by
which
