for
my
troglodyte
friend.
Give
me
better
health
and
a
little
spate
of
energy,
and
I
shall
try
conclusions
with
him
yet.
But
who
and
what
is
he?
Ah!
there
is
the
question
which
stands
between
me
and
my
sleep.
How
many
theories
do
I
form,
only
to
discard
each
in
turn!
It
is
all
so
utterly
unthinkable.
And
yet
the
cry,
the
footmark,
the
tread
in
the
cavern
no
reasoning
can
get
past
these
I
think
of
the
old
world
legends
of
dragons
and
of
other
monsters.
Were
they,
perhaps,
not
such
fairy
tales
as
we
have
thought?
Can
it
be
that
there
is
some
fact
which
underlies
them,
and
am
I,
of
all
mortals,
the
one
who
is
chosen
to
expose
it?
May

For
several
days
I
have
been
laid
up
by
the
vagaries
of
an
English
spring,
and
during
those
days
there
have
been
developments,
the
true
and
sinister
meaning
of
which
no
one
can
appreciate
save
myself.
I
may
say
that
we
have
had
cloudy
and
moonless
nights
of
late,
which
according
to
my
information
were
the
seasons
upon
which
sheep
disappeared.
Well,
sheep
have
disappeared.
Two
of
Miss
Allerton's,
one
of
old
Pearson's
of
the
Cat
Walk,
and
one
of
Mrs.
Moulton's.
Four
in
all
during
three
nights.
No
trace
is
left
of
them
at
all,
and
the
countryside
is
buzzing
with
rumours
of
gipsies
and
of
sheep
stealers.
But
there
is
something
more
serious
than
that.
Young
Armitage
has
disappeared
also.
He
left
his
moorland
cottage
early
on
Wednesday
night
and
has
never
been
heard
of
since.
He
was
an
unattached
man,
so
there
is
less
sensation
than
would
otherwise
be
the
case.
The
popular
explanation
is
that
he
owes
money,
and
has
found
a
situation
in
some
other
part
of
the
country,
whence
he
will
presently
write
for
his
belongings.
But
I
have
grave
misgivings.
Is
it
not
much
more
likely
that
the
recent
tragedy
of
the
sheep
has
caused
him
to
take
some
steps
which
may
have
ended
in
his
own
destruction?
He
may,
for
example,
have
lain
in
wait
for
the
creature
and
been
carried
off
by
it
into
the
recesses
of
the
mountains.
What
an
inconceivable
fate
for
a
civilized
Englishman
of
the
twentieth
century!
And
yet
I
feel
that
it
is
possible
and
even
probable.
But
in
that
case,
how
far
am
I
answerable
both
for
his
death
and
for
any
other
mishap
which
may
occur?
Surely
with
the
knowledge
I
already
possess
it
must
be
my
duty
to
see
that
something
is
done,
or
if
necessary
to
do
it
myself.
It
must
be
the
latter,
for
this
morning
I
went
down
to
the
local
police
station
and
told
my
story.
The
inspector
entered
it
all
in
a
large
book
and
bowed
me
out
with
commendable
gravity,
but
I
heard
a
burst
of
laughter
before
I
had
got
down
his
garden
path.
No
doubt
he
was
recounting
my
adventure
to
his
family.
