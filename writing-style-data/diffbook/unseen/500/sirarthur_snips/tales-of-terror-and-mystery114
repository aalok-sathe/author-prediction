kept.
No
house
could
be
dismal
which
had
a
pretty
girl
inside
it
and
such
a
show
of
roses
in
front.
Apart
from
a
very
complete
staff
of
servants
there
were
only
four
of
us
in
the
household.
These
were
Miss
Witherton,
who
was
at
that
time
four
and
twenty
and
as
pretty
well,
as
pretty
as
Mrs.
Colmore
is
now
myself,
Frank
Colmore,
aged
thirty,
Mrs.
Stevens,
the
housekeeper,
a
dry,
silent
woman,
and
Mr.
Richards,
a
tall
military
looking
man,
who
acted
as
steward
to
the
Bollamore
estates.
We
four
always
had
our
meals
together,
but
Sir
John
had
his
usually
alone
in
the
library.
Sometimes
he
joined
us
at
dinner,
but
on
the
whole
we
were
just
as
glad
when
he
did
not.
For
he
was
a
very
formidable
person.
Imagine
a
man
six
feet
three
inches
in
height,
majestically
built,
with
a
high
nosed,
aristocratic
face,
brindled
hair,
shaggy
eyebrows,
a
small,
pointed
Mephistophelian
beard,
and
lines
upon
his
brow
and
round
his
eyes
as
deep
as
if
they
had
been
carved
with
a
penknife.
He
had
grey
eyes,
weary,
hopeless
looking
eyes,
proud
and
yet
pathetic,
eyes
which
claimed
your
pity
and
yet
dared
you
to
show
it.
His
back
was
rounded
with
study,
but
otherwise
he
was
as
fine
a
looking
man
of
his
age
five
and
fifty
perhaps
as
any
woman
would
wish
to
look
upon.
But
his
presence
was
not
a
cheerful
one.
He
was
always
courteous,
always
refined,
but
singularly
silent
and
retiring.
I
have
never
lived
so
long
with
any
man
and
known
so
little
of
him.
If
he
were
indoors
he
spent
his
time
either
in
his
own
small
study
in
the
Eastern
Tower,
or
in
the
library
in
the
modern
wing.
So
regular
was
his
routine
that
one
could
always
say
at
any
hour
exactly
where
he
would
be.
Twice
in
the
day
he
would
visit
his
study,
once
after
breakfast,
and
once
about
ten
at
night.
You
might
set
your
watch
by
the
slam
of
the
heavy
door.
For
the
rest
of
the
day
he
would
be
in
his
library
save
that
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
he
would
take
a
walk
or
a
ride,
which
was
solitary
like
the
rest
of
his
existence.
He
loved
his
children,
and
was
keenly
interested
in
the
progress
of
their
studies,
but
they
were
a
little
awed
by
the
silent,
shaggy
browed
figure,
and
they
avoided
him
as
much
as
they
could.
Indeed,
we
all
did
that.
It
was
some
time
before
I
came
to
know
anything
about
the
circumstances
of
Sir
John
Bollamore's
life,
for
Mrs.
Stevens,
the
housekeeper,
and
Mr.
Richards,
the
land
steward,
were
too
loyal
to
talk
easily
of
their
employer's
affairs.
As
to
the
governess,
she
knew
no
more
than
I
did,
and
our
common
interest
was
one
of
the
causes
which
drew
us
together.
At
last,
however,
an
incident
occurred
which
led
to
a
closer
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Richards
and
a
