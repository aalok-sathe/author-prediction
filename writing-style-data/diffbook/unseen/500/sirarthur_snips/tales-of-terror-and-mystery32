upon
an
emigrant
ship,
lay
the
Christians
of
old
Rome.
The
yellow
light
flickered
over
the
shrivelled
features
of
the
mummies,
and
gleamed
upon
rounded
skulls
and
long,
white
armbones
crossed
over
fleshless
chests.
And
everywhere
as
he
passed
Kennedy
looked
with
wistful
eyes
upon
inscriptions,
funeral
vessels,
pictures,
vestments,
utensils,
all
lying
as
pious
hands
had
placed
them
so
many
centuries
ago.
It
was
apparent
to
him,
even
in
those
hurried,
passing
glances,
that
this
was
the
earliest
and
finest
of
the
catacombs,
containing
such
a
storehouse
of
Roman
remains
as
had
never
before
come
at
one
time
under
the
observation
of
the
student.
"What
would
happen
if
the
light
went
out?"
he
asked,
as
they
hurried
onwards.
"I
have
a
spare
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
in
my
pocket.
By
the
way,
Kennedy,
have
you
any
matches?"
"No;
you
had
better
give
me
some."
"Oh,
that
is
all
right.
There
is
no
chance
of
our
separating."
"How
far
are
we
going?
It
seems
to
me
that
we
have
walked
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile."
"More
than
that,
I
think.
There
is
really
no
limit
to
the
tombs
at
least,
I
have
never
been
able
to
find
any.
This
is
a
very
difficult
place,
so
I
think
that
I
will
use
our
ball
of
string."
He
fastened
one
end
of
it
to
a
projecting
stone
and
he
carried
the
coil
in
the
breast
of
his
coat,
paying
it
out
as
he
advanced.
Kennedy
saw
that
it
was
no
unnecessary
precaution,
for
the
passages
had
become
more
complex
and
tortuous
than
ever,
with
a
perfect
network
of
intersecting
corridors.
But
these
all
ended
in
one
large
circular
hall
with
a
square
pedestal
of
tufa
topped
with
a
slab
of
marble
at
one
end
of
it.
"By
Jove!"
cried
Kennedy
in
an
ecstasy,
as
Burger
swung
his
lantern
over
the
marble.
"It
is
a
Christian
altar
probably
the
first
one
in
existence.
Here
is
the
little
consecration
cross
cut
upon
the
corner
of
it.
No
doubt
this
circular
space
was
used
as
a
church."
"Precisely,"
said
Burger.
"If
I
had
more
time
I
should
like
to
show
you
all
the
bodies
which
are
buried
in
these
niches
upon
the
walls,
for
they
are
the
early
popes
and
bishops
of
the
Church,
with
their
mitres,
their
croziers,
and
full
canonicals.
Go
over
to
that
one
and
look
at
it!"
Kennedy
went
across,
and
stared
at
the
ghastly
head
which
lay
loosely
on
the
shredded
and
mouldering
mitre.
"This
is
most
interesting,"
said
he,
and
his
voice
seemed
to
boom
against
the
concave
vault.
"As
far
as
my
experience
goes,
it
is
unique.
Bring
the
lantern
over,
Burger,
for
I
want
to
see
them
all."
But
the
German
had
strolled
away,
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
yellow
circle
of
light
at
the
other
side
of
the
hall.
"Do
you
know
how
many
wrong
turnings
there
are
between
this
and
the
stairs?"
he
asked.
"There
are
over
two
