But
in
spite
of
his
melancholy
bearing
and
despondent
expression,
there
were
few
who
could
say
that
they
had
ever
seen
a
man
of
more
distinguished
presence.
Bowing
to
the
judge,
he
asked
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
make
a
statement,
and
having
been
duly
informed
that
whatever
he
said
might
be
used
against
him,
he
bowed
once
more,
and
proceeded:
"My
wish,"
said
he,
"is
to
hold
nothing
back,
but
to
tell
with
perfect
frankness
all
that
occurred
upon
the
night
of
the
21st
of
June.
Had
I
known
that
the
innocent
had
suffered,
and
that
so
much
trouble
had
been
brought
upon
those
whom
I
love
best
in
the
world,
I
should
have
come
forward
long
ago;
but
there
were
reasons
which
prevented
these
things
from
coming
to
my
ears.
It
was
my
desire
that
an
unhappy
man
should
vanish
from
the
world
which
had
known
him,
but
I
had
not
foreseen
that
others
would
be
affected
by
my
actions.
Let
me
to
the
best
of
my
ability
repair
the
evil
which
I
have
done.
"To
anyone
who
is
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
Argentine
Republic
the
name
of
Lana
is
well
known.
My
father,
who
came
of
the
best
blood
of
old
Spain,
filled
all
the
highest
offices
of
the
State,
and
would
have
been
President
but
for
his
death
in
the
riots
of
San
Juan.
A
brilliant
career
might
have
been
open
to
my
twin
brother
Ernest
and
myself
had
it
not
been
for
financial
losses
which
made
it
necessary
that
we
should
earn
our
own
living.
I
apologize,
sir,
if
these
details
appear
to
be
irrelevant,
but
they
are
a
necessary
introduction
to
that
which
is
to
follow.
"I
had,
as
I
have
said,
a
twin
brother
named
Ernest,
whose
resemblance
to
me
was
so
great
that
even
when
we
were
together
people
could
see
no
difference
between
us.
Down
to
the
smallest
detail
we
were
exactly
the
same.
As
we
grew
older
this
likeness
became
less
marked
because
our
expression
was
not
the
same,
but
with
our
features
in
repose
the
points
of
difference
were
very
slight.
"It
does
not
become
me
to
say
too
much
of
one
who
is
dead,
the
more
so
as
he
is
my
only
brother,
but
I
leave
his
character
to
those
who
knew
him
best.
I
will
only
say
for
I
HAVE
to
say
it
that
in
my
early
manhood
I
conceived
a
horror
of
him,
and
that
I
had
good
reason
for
the
aversion
which
filled
me.
My
own
reputation
suffered
from
his
actions,
for
our
close
resemblance
caused
me
to
be
credited
with
many
of
them.
Eventually,
in
a
peculiarly
disgraceful
business,
he
contrived
to
throw
the
whole
odium
upon
me
in
such
a
way
that
I
was
forced
to
leave
the
Argentine
for
ever,
and
to
seek
a
career
in
Europe.
The
freedom
from
his
hated
presence
more
than
compensated
me
for
the
loss
of
my
native
land.
I
had
enough
money
to
