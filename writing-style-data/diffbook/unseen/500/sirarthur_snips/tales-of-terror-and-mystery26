savants
might
spend
a
lifetime
over
them,
and
build
up
a
reputation
as
solid
as
the
Castle
of
St.
Angelo."
Kennedy
sat
thinking
with
his
fine
forehead
wrinkled
and
his
fingers
playing
with
his
long,
fair
moustache.
"You
have
given
yourself
away,
Burger!"
said
he
at
last.
"Your
words
can
only
apply
to
one
thing.
You
have
discovered
a
new
catacomb."
"I
had
no
doubt
that
you
had
already
come
to
that
conclusion
from
an
examination
of
these
objects."
"Well,
they
certainly
appeared
to
indicate
it,
but
your
last
remarks
make
it
certain.
There
is
no
place
except
a
catacomb
which
could
contain
so
vast
a
store
of
relics
as
you
describe."
"Quite
so.
There
is
no
mystery
about
that.
I
HAVE
discovered
a
new
catacomb."
"Where?"
"Ah,
that
is
my
secret,
my
dear
Kennedy.
Suffice
it
that
it
is
so
situated
that
there
is
not
one
chance
in
a
million
of
anyone
else
coming
upon
it.
Its
date
is
different
from
that
of
any
known
catacomb,
and
it
has
been
reserved
for
the
burial
of
the
highest
Christians,
so
that
the
remains
and
the
relics
are
quite
different
from
anything
which
has
ever
been
seen
before.
If
I
was
not
aware
of
your
knowledge
and
of
your
energy,
my
friend,
I
would
not
hesitate,
under
the
pledge
of
secrecy,
to
tell
you
everything
about
it.
But
as
it
is
I
think
that
I
must
certainly
prepare
my
own
report
of
the
matter
before
I
expose
myself
to
such
formidable
competition."
Kennedy
loved
his
subject
with
a
love
which
was
almost
a
mania
a
love
which
held
him
true
to
it,
amidst
all
the
distractions
which
come
to
a
wealthy
and
dissipated
young
man.
He
had
ambition,
but
his
ambition
was
secondary
to
his
mere
abstract
joy
and
interest
in
everything
which
concerned
the
old
life
and
history
of
the
city.
He
yearned
to
see
this
new
underworld
which
his
companion
had
discovered.
"Look
here,
Burger,"
said
he,
earnestly,
"I
assure
you
that
you
can
trust
me
most
implicitly
in
the
matter.
Nothing
would
induce
me
to
put
pen
to
paper
about
anything
which
I
see
until
I
have
your
express
permission.
I
quite
understand
your
feeling
and
I
think
it
is
most
natural,
but
you
have
really
nothing
whatever
to
fear
from
me.
On
the
other
hand,
if
you
don't
tell
me
I
shall
make
a
systematic
search,
and
I
shall
most
certainly
discover
it.
In
that
case,
of
course,
I
should
make
what
use
I
liked
of
it,
since
I
should
be
under
no
obligation
to
you."
Burger
smiled
thoughtfully
over
his
cigar.
"I
have
noticed,
friend
Kennedy,"
said
he,
"that
when
I
want
information
over
any
point
you
are
not
always
so
ready
to
supply
it."
"When
did
you
ever
ask
me
anything
that
I
did
not
tell
you?
You
remember,
for
example,
my
giving
you
the
material
for
your
paper
about
the
temple
of
the
Vestals."
"Ah,
well,
that
was
not
a
matter
of
much
importance.
