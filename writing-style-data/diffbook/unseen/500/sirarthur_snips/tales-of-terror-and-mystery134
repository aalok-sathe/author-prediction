defray
my
medical
studies
at
Glasgow,
and
I
finally
settled
in
practice
at
Bishop's
Crossing,
in
the
firm
conviction
that
in
that
remote
Lancashire
hamlet
I
should
never
hear
of
him
again.
"For
years
my
hopes
were
fulfilled,
and
then
at
last
he
discovered
me.
Some
Liverpool
man
who
visited
Buenos
Ayres
put
him
upon
my
track.
He
had
lost
all
his
money,
and
he
thought
that
he
would
come
over
and
share
mine.
Knowing
my
horror
of
him,
he
rightly
thought
that
I
would
be
willing
to
buy
him
off.
I
received
a
letter
from
him
saying
that
he
was
coming.
It
was
at
a
crisis
in
my
own
affairs,
and
his
arrival
might
conceivably
bring
trouble,
and
even
disgrace,
upon
some
whom
I
was
especially
bound
to
shield
from
anything
of
the
kind.
I
took
steps
to
insure
that
any
evil
which
might
come
should
fall
on
me
only,
and
that"
here
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
prisoner
"was
the
cause
of
conduct
upon
my
part
which
has
been
too
harshly
judged.
My
only
motive
was
to
screen
those
who
were
dear
to
me
from
any
possible
connection
with
scandal
or
disgrace.
That
scandal
and
disgrace
would
come
with
my
brother
was
only
to
say
that
what
had
been
would
be
again.
"My
brother
arrived
himself
one
night
not
very
long
after
my
receipt
of
the
letter.
I
was
sitting
in
my
study
after
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed,
when
I
heard
a
footstep
upon
the
gravel
outside,
and
an
instant
later
I
saw
his
face
looking
in
at
me
through
the
window.
He
was
a
clean
shaven
man
like
myself,
and
the
resemblance
between
us
was
still
so
great
that,
for
an
instant,
I
thought
it
was
my
own
reflection
in
the
glass.
He
had
a
dark
patch
over
his
eye,
but
our
features
were
absolutely
the
same.
Then
he
smiled
in
a
sardonic
way
which
had
been
a
trick
of
his
from
his
boyhood,
and
I
knew
that
he
was
the
same
brother
who
had
driven
me
from
my
native
land,
and
brought
disgrace
upon
what
had
been
an
honourable
name.
I
went
to
the
door
and
I
admitted
him.
That
would
be
about
ten
o'clock
that
night.
"When
he
came
into
the
glare
of
the
lamp,
I
saw
at
once
that
he
had
fallen
upon
very
evil
days.
He
had
walked
from
Liverpool,
and
he
was
tired
and
ill.
I
was
quite
shocked
by
the
expression
upon
his
face.
My
medical
knowledge
told
me
that
there
was
some
serious
internal
malady.
He
had
been
drinking
also,
and
his
face
was
bruised
as
the
result
of
a
scuffle
which
he
had
had
with
some
sailors.
It
was
to
cover
his
injured
eye
that
he
wore
this
patch,
which
he
removed
when
he
entered
the
room.
He
was
himself
dressed
in
a
pea
jacket
and
flannel
shirt,
and
his
feet
were
bursting
through
his
boots.
But
his
poverty
had
only
made
him
more
savagely
vindictive
