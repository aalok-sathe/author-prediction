most
of
us
to
Paris,
my
English
colleague
to
Manchester,
and
McPherson
to
Southampton,
whence
he
emigrated
to
America.
Let
the
English
papers
of
that
date
tell
how
throughly
we
had
done
our
work,
and
how
completely
we
had
thrown
the
cleverest
of
their
detectives
off
our
track.
"You
will
remember
that
Gomez
threw
his
bag
of
papers
out
of
the
window,
and
I
need
not
say
that
I
secured
that
bag
and
brought
them
to
my
employers.
It
may
interest
my
employers
now,
however,
to
learn
that
out
of
that
bag
I
took
one
or
two
little
papers
as
a
souvenir
of
the
occasion.
I
have
no
wish
to
publish
these
papers;
but,
still,
it
is
every
man
for
himself
in
this
world,
and
what
else
can
I
do
if
my
friends
will
not
come
to
my
aid
when
I
want
them?
Messieurs,
you
may
believe
that
Herbert
de
Lernac
is
quite
as
formidable
when
he
is
against
you
as
when
he
is
with
you,
and
that
he
is
not
a
man
to
go
to
the
guillotine
until
he
has
seen
that
every
one
of
you
is
en
route
for
New
Caledonia.
For
your
own
sake,
if
not
for
mine,
make
haste,
Monsieur
de
,
and
General
,
and
Baron
(you
can
fill
up
the
blanks
for
yourselves
as
you
read
this).
I
promise
you
that
in
the
next
edition
there
will
be
no
blanks
to
fill.
"P.S.
As
I
look
over
my
statement
there
is
only
one
omission
which
I
can
see.
It
concerns
the
unfortunate
man
McPherson,
who
was
foolish
enough
to
write
to
his
wife
and
to
make
an
appointment
with
her
in
New
York.
It
can
be
imagined
that
when
interests
like
ours
were
at
stake,
we
could
not
leave
them
to
the
chance
of
whether
a
man
in
that
class
of
life
would
or
would
not
give
away
his
secrets
to
a
woman.
Having
once
broken
his
oath
by
writing
to
his
wife,
we
could
not
trust
him
any
more.
We
took
steps
therefore
to
insure
that
he
should
not
see
his
wife.
I
have
sometimes
thought
that
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
write
to
her
and
to
assure
her
that
there
is
no
impediment
to
her
marrying
again."

A
curious
experience?
said
the
Doctor.
Yes,
my
friends,
I
have
had
one
very
curious
experience.
I
never
expect
to
have
another,
for
it
is
against
all
doctrines
of
chances
that
two
such
events
would
befall
any
one
man
in
a
single
lifetime.
You
may
believe
me
or
not,
but
the
thing
happened
exactly
as
I
tell
it.
I
had
just
become
a
medical
man,
but
I
had
not
started
in
practice,
and
I
lived
in
rooms
in
Gower
Street.
The
street
has
been
renumbered
since
then,
but
it
was
in
the
only
house
which
has
a
bow
window,
upon
the
left
hand
side
as
you
go
down
from
the
Metropolitan
Station.
