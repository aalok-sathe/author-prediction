the
flight
with
a
telescope,
declares
that
just
before
the
clouds
obscured
the
view
he
saw
the
machine,
which
was
at
an
enormous
height,
suddenly
rise
perpendicularly
upwards
in
a
succession
of
jerks
in
a
manner
that
he
would
have
thought
to
be
impossible.
That
was
the
last
seen
of
Baxter.
There
was
a
correspondence
in
the
papers,
but
it
never
led
to
anything.
There
were
several
other
similar
cases,
and
then
there
was
the
death
of
Hay
Connor.
What
a
cackle
there
was
about
an
unsolved
mystery
of
the
air,
and
what
columns
in
the
halfpenny
papers,
and
yet
how
little
was
ever
done
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
business!
He
came
down
in
a
tremendous
vol
plane
from
an
unknown
height.
He
never
got
off
his
machine
and
died
in
his
pilot's
seat.
Died
of
what?
'Heart
disease,'
said
the
doctors.
Rubbish!
Hay
Connor's
heart
was
as
sound
as
mine
is.
What
did
Venables
say?
Venables
was
the
only
man
who
was
at
his
side
when
he
died.
He
said
that
he
was
shivering
and
looked
like
a
man
who
had
been
badly
scared.
'Died
of
fright,'
said
Venables,
but
could
not
imagine
what
he
was
frightened
about.
Only
said
one
word
to
Venables,
which
sounded
like
'Monstrous.'
They
could
make
nothing
of
that
at
the
inquest.
But
I
could
make
something
of
it.
Monsters!
That
was
the
last
word
of
poor
Harry
Hay
Connor.
And
he
DID
die
of
fright,
just
as
Venables
thought.
"And
then
there
was
Myrtle's
head.
Do
you
really
believe
does
anybody
really
believe
that
a
man's
head
could
be
driven
clean
into
his
body
by
the
force
of
a
fall?
Well,
perhaps
it
may
be
possible,
but
I,
for
one,
have
never
believed
that
it
was
so
with
Myrtle.
And
the
grease
upon
his
clothes
'all
slimy
with
grease,'
said
somebody
at
the
inquest.
Queer
that
nobody
got
thinking
after
that!
I
did
but,
then,
I
had
been
thinking
for
a
good
long
time.
I've
made
three
ascents
how
Dangerfield
used
to
chaff
me
about
my
shot
gun
but
I've
never
been
high
enough.
Now,
with
this
new,
light
Paul
Veroner
machine
and
its
one
hundred
and
seventy
five
Robur,
I
should
easily
touch
the
thirty
thousand
tomorrow.
I'll
have
a
shot
at
the
record.
Maybe
I
shall
have
a
shot
at
something
else
as
well.
Of
course,
it's
dangerous.
If
a
fellow
wants
to
avoid
danger
he
had
best
keep
out
of
flying
altogether
and
subside
finally
into
flannel
slippers
and
a
dressing
gown.
But
I'll
visit
the
air
jungle
tomorrow
and
if
there's
anything
there
I
shall
know
it.
If
I
return,
I'll
find
myself
a
bit
of
a
celebrity.
If
I
don't
this
note
book
may
explain
what
I
am
trying
to
do,
and
how
I
lost
my
life
in
doing
it.
But
no
drivel
about
accidents
or
mysteries,
if
YOU
please.
