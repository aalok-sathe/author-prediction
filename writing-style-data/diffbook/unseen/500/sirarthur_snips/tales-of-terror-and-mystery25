spoke
of
his
own
subject
that
his
face
was
filled
with
life
and
soul.
At
other
times
he
was
silent
and
embarrassed,
too
conscious
of
his
own
limitations
in
larger
subjects,
and
impatient
of
that
small
talk
which
is
the
conventional
refuge
of
those
who
have
no
thoughts
to
express.
And
yet
for
some
years
there
had
been
an
acquaintanceship
which
appeared
to
be
slowly
ripening
into
a
friendship
between
these
two
very
different
rivals.
The
base
and
origin
of
this
lay
in
the
fact
that
in
their
own
studies
each
was
the
only
one
of
the
younger
men
who
had
knowledge
and
enthusiasm
enough
to
properly
appreciate
the
other.
Their
common
interests
and
pursuits
had
brought
them
together,
and
each
had
been
attracted
by
the
other's
knowledge.
And
then
gradually
something
had
been
added
to
this.
Kennedy
had
been
amused
by
the
frankness
and
simplicity
of
his
rival,
while
Burger
in
turn
had
been
fascinated
by
the
brilliancy
and
vivacity
which
had
made
Kennedy
such
a
favourite
in
Roman
society.
I
say
"had,"
because
just
at
the
moment
the
young
Englishman
was
somewhat
under
a
cloud.
A
love
affair,
the
details
of
which
had
never
quite
come
out,
had
indicated
a
heartlessness
and
callousness
upon
his
part
which
shocked
many
of
his
friends.
But
in
the
bachelor
circles
of
students
and
artists
in
which
he
preferred
to
move
there
is
no
very
rigid
code
of
honour
in
such
matters,
and
though
a
head
might
be
shaken
or
a
pair
of
shoulders
shrugged
over
the
flight
of
two
and
the
return
of
one,
the
general
sentiment
was
probably
one
of
curiosity
and
perhaps
of
envy
rather
than
of
reprobation.
"Look
here,
Burger,"
said
Kennedy,
looking
hard
at
the
placid
face
of
his
companion,
"I
do
wish
that
you
would
confide
in
me."
As
he
spoke
he
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
a
rug
which
lay
upon
the
floor.
On
the
rug
stood
a
long,
shallow
fruit
basket
of
the
light
wicker
work
which
is
used
in
the
Campagna,
and
this
was
heaped
with
a
litter
of
objects,
inscribed
tiles,
broken
inscriptions,
cracked
mosaics,
torn
papyri,
rusty
metal
ornaments,
which
to
the
uninitiated
might
have
seemed
to
have
come
straight
from
a
dustman's
bin,
but
which
a
specialist
would
have
speedily
recognized
as
unique
of
their
kind.
The
pile
of
odds
and
ends
in
the
flat
wicker
work
basket
supplied
exactly
one
of
those
missing
links
of
social
development
which
are
of
such
interest
to
the
student.
It
was
the
German
who
had
brought
them
in,
and
the
Englishman's
eyes
were
hungry
as
he
looked
at
them.
"I
won't
interfere
with
your
treasure
trove,
but
I
should
very
much
like
to
hear
about
it,"
he
continued,
while
Burger
very
deliberately
lit
a
cigar.
"It
is
evidently
a
discovery
of
the
first
importance.
These
inscriptions
will
make
a
sensation
throughout
Europe."
"For
every
one
here
there
are
a
million
there!"
said
the
German.
"There
are
so
many
that
a
dozen
