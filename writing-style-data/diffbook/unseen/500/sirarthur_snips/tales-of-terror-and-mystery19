solemnity
into
my
soul.
Finally
I
undressed,
and
turning
out
the
lamp,
I
lay
down.
After
long
tossing
I
fell
asleep.
Let
me
try
to
describe
as
accurately
as
I
can
the
scene
which
came
to
me
in
my
dreams.
It
stands
out
now
in
my
memory
more
clearly
than
anything
which
I
have
seen
with
my
waking
eyes.
There
was
a
room
which
bore
the
appearance
of
a
vault.
Four
spandrels
from
the
corners
ran
up
to
join
a
sharp,
cup
shaped
roof.
The
architecture
was
rough,
but
very
strong.
It
was
evidently
part
of
a
great
building.
Three
men
in
black,
with
curious,
top
heavy,
black
velvet
hats,
sat
in
a
line
upon
a
red
carpeted
dais.
Their
faces
were
very
solemn
and
sad.
On
the
left
stood
two
long
gowned
men
with
port
folios
in
their
hands,
which
seemed
to
be
stuffed
with
papers.
Upon
the
right,
looking
toward
me,
was
a
small
woman
with
blonde
hair
and
singular,
light
blue
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
child.
She
was
past
her
first
youth,
but
could
not
yet
be
called
middle
aged.
Her
figure
was
inclined
to
stoutness
and
her
bearing
was
proud
and
confident.
Her
face
was
pale,
but
serene.
It
was
a
curious
face,
comely
and
yet
feline,
with
a
subtle
suggestion
of
cruelty
about
the
straight,
strong
little
mouth
and
chubby
jaw.
She
was
draped
in
some
sort
of
loose,
white
gown.
Beside
her
stood
a
thin,
eager
priest,
who
whispered
in
her
ear,
and
continually
raised
a
crucifix
before
her
eyes.
She
turned
her
head
and
looked
fixedly
past
the
crucifix
at
the
three
men
in
black,
who
were,
I
felt,
her
judges.
As
I
gazed
the
three
men
stood
up
and
said
something,
but
I
could
distinguish
no
words,
though
I
was
aware
that
it
was
the
central
one
who
was
speaking.
They
then
swept
out
of
the
room,
followed
by
the
two
men
with
the
papers.
At
the
same
instant
several
rough
looking
fellows
in
stout
jerkins
came
bustling
in
and
removed
first
the
red
carpet,
and
then
the
boards
which
formed
the
dais,
so
as
to
entirely
clear
the
room.
When
this
screen
was
removed
I
saw
some
singular
articles
of
furniture
behind
it.
One
looked
like
a
bed
with
wooden
rollers
at
each
end,
and
a
winch
handle
to
regulate
its
length.
Another
was
a
wooden
horse.
There
were
several
other
curious
objects,
and
a
number
of
swinging
cords
which
played
over
pulleys.
It
was
not
unlike
a
modern
gymnasium.
When
the
room
had
been
cleared
there
appeared
a
new
figure
upon
the
scene.
This
was
a
tall,
thin
person
clad
in
black,
with
a
gaunt
and
austere
face.
The
aspect
of
the
man
made
me
shudder.
His
clothes
were
all
shining
with
grease
and
mottled
with
stains.
He
bore
himself
with
a
slow
and
impressive
dignity,
as
if
he
took
command
of
all
things
from
the
instant
of
his
entrance.
In
spite
of
his
rude
appearance
and
sordid
dress,
