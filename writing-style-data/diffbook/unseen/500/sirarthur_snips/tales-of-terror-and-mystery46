they
had
been
done
yesterday.
Down
this
strange,
old
world
corridor
I
stumbled,
my
feeble
flame
throwing
a
dim
circle
of
light
around
me,
which
made
the
shadows
beyond
the
more
threatening
and
obscure.
Finally,
I
came
to
a
spot
where
the
Roman
tunnel
opened
into
a
water
worn
cavern
a
huge
hall,
hung
with
long
white
icicles
of
lime
deposit.
From
this
central
chamber
I
could
dimly
perceive
that
a
number
of
passages
worn
by
the
subterranean
streams
wound
away
into
the
depths
of
the
earth.
I
was
standing
there
wondering
whether
I
had
better
return,
or
whether
I
dare
venture
farther
into
this
dangerous
labyrinth,
when
my
eyes
fell
upon
something
at
my
feet
which
strongly
arrested
my
attention.
The
greater
part
of
the
floor
of
the
cavern
was
covered
with
boulders
of
rock
or
with
hard
incrustations
of
lime,
but
at
this
particular
point
there
had
been
a
drip
from
the
distant
roof,
which
had
left
a
patch
of
soft
mud.
In
the
very
centre
of
this
there
was
a
huge
mark
an
ill
defined
blotch,
deep,
broad
and
irregular,
as
if
a
great
boulder
had
fallen
upon
it.
No
loose
stone
lay
near,
however,
nor
was
there
anything
to
account
for
the
impression.
It
was
far
too
large
to
be
caused
by
any
possible
animal,
and
besides,
there
was
only
the
one,
and
the
patch
of
mud
was
of
such
a
size
that
no
reasonable
stride
could
have
covered
it.
As
I
rose
from
the
examination
of
that
singular
mark
and
then
looked
round
into
the
black
shadows
which
hemmed
me
in,
I
must
confess
that
I
felt
for
a
moment
a
most
unpleasant
sinking
of
my
heart,
and
that,
do
what
I
could,
the
candle
trembled
in
my
outstretched
hand.
I
soon
recovered
my
nerve,
however,
when
I
reflected
how
absurd
it
was
to
associate
so
huge
and
shapeless
a
mark
with
the
track
of
any
known
animal.
Even
an
elephant
could
not
have
produced
it.
I
determined,
therefore,
that
I
would
not
be
scared
by
vague
and
senseless
fears
from
carrying
out
my
exploration.
Before
proceeding,
I
took
good
note
of
a
curious
rock
formation
in
the
wall
by
which
I
could
recognize
the
entrance
of
the
Roman
tunnel.
The
precaution
was
very
necessary,
for
the
great
cave,
so
far
as
I
could
see
it,
was
intersected
by
passages.
Having
made
sure
of
my
position,
and
reassured
myself
by
examining
my
spare
candles
and
my
matches,
I
advanced
slowly
over
the
rocky
and
uneven
surface
of
the
cavern.
And
now
I
come
to
the
point
where
I
met
with
such
sudden
and
desperate
disaster.
A
stream,
some
twenty
feet
broad,
ran
across
my
path,
and
I
walked
for
some
little
distance
along
the
bank
to
find
a
spot
where
I
could
cross
dry
shod.
Finally,
I
came
to
a
place
where
a
single
flat
boulder
lay
near
the
centre,
which
I
could
reach
in
a
stride.
As
it
chanced,
however,
the
rock
had
been
