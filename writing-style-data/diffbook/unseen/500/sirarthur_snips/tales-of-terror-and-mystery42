"John,"
said
Lord
Sannox,
"you
will
take
the
doctor
home
first.
He
will
want
leading
downstairs,
I
think.
Tell
his
butler
that
he
has
been
taken
ill
at
a
case."
"Very
good,
sir."
"Then
you
can
take
Lady
Sannox
home."
"And
how
about
yourself,
sir?"
"Oh,
my
address
for
the
next
few
months
will
be
Hotel
di
Roma,
Venice.
Just
see
that
the
letters
are
sent
on.
And
tell
Stevens
to
exhibit
all
the
purple
chrysanthemums
next
Monday,
and
to
wire
me
the
result."
The
Terror
of
Blue
John
Gap
The
following
narrative
was
found
among
the
papers
of
Dr.
James
Hardcastle,
who
died
of
phthisis
on
February
4th,
1908,
at
36,
Upper
Coventry
Flats,
South
Kensington.
Those
who
knew
him
best,
while
refusing
to
express
an
opinion
upon
this
particular
statement,
are
unanimous
in
asserting
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
sober
and
scientific
turn
of
mind,
absolutely
devoid
of
imagination,
and
most
unlikely
to
invent
any
abnormal
series
of
events.
The
paper
was
contained
in
an
envelope,
which
was
docketed,
"A
Short
Account
of
the
Circumstances
which
occurred
near
Miss
Allerton's
Farm
in
North
West
Derbyshire
in
the
Spring
of
Last
Year."
The
envelope
was
sealed,
and
on
the
other
side
was
written
in
pencil
DEAR
SEATON,
"It
may
interest,
and
perhaps
pain
you,
to
know
that
the
incredulity
with
which
you
met
my
story
has
prevented
me
from
ever
opening
my
mouth
upon
the
subject
again.
I
leave
this
record
after
my
death,
and
perhaps
strangers
may
be
found
to
have
more
confidence
in
me
than
my
friend."
Inquiry
has
failed
to
elicit
who
this
Seaton
may
have
been.
I
may
add
that
the
visit
of
the
deceased
to
Allerton's
Farm,
and
the
general
nature
of
the
alarm
there,
apart
from
his
particular
explanation,
have
been
absolutely
established.
With
this
foreword
I
append
his
account
exactly
as
he
left
it.
It
is
in
the
form
of
a
diary,
some
entries
in
which
have
been
expanded,
while
a
few
have
been
erased.
April
17.
Already
I
feel
the
benefit
of
this
wonderful
upland
air.
The
farm
of
the
Allertons
lies
fourteen
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
sea
level,
so
it
may
well
be
a
bracing
climate.
Beyond
the
usual
morning
cough
I
have
very
little
discomfort,
and,
what
with
the
fresh
milk
and
the
home
grown
mutton,
I
have
every
chance
of
putting
on
weight.
I
think
Saunderson
will
be
pleased.
The
two
Miss
Allertons
are
charmingly
quaint
and
kind,
two
dear
little
hard
working
old
maids,
who
are
ready
to
lavish
all
the
heart
which
might
have
gone
out
to
husband
and
to
children
upon
an
invalid
stranger.
Truly,
the
old
maid
is
a
most
useful
person,
one
of
the
reserve
forces
of
the
community.
They
talk
of
the
superfluous
woman,
but
what
would
the
poor
superfluous
man
do
without
her
kindly
presence?
By
the
way,
in
their
simplicity
they
very
quickly
let
out
the
reason
why
Saunderson
recommended
their
farm.
The
