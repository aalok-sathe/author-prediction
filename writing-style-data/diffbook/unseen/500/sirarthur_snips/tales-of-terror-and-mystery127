she
rang
at
the
front
door,
roused
Mrs.
Woods,
the
housekeeper,
and
the
two
women
made
their
way
into
the
study,
having
first
dispatched
the
maidservant
to
the
police
station.
At
the
side
of
the
table,
away
from
the
window,
Dr.
Lana
was
discovered
stretched
upon
his
back
and
quite
dead.
It
was
evident
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
violence,
for
one
of
his
eyes
was
blackened
and
there
were
marks
of
bruises
about
his
face
and
neck.
A
slight
thickening
and
swelling
of
his
features
appeared
to
suggest
that
the
cause
of
his
death
had
been
strangulation.
He
was
dressed
in
his
usual
professional
clothes,
but
wore
cloth
slippers,
the
soles
of
which
were
perfectly
clean.
The
carpet
was
marked
all
over,
especially
on
the
side
of
the
door,
with
traces
of
dirty
boots,
which
were
presumably
left
by
the
murderer.
It
was
evident
that
someone
had
entered
by
the
surgery
door,
had
killed
the
doctor,
and
had
then
made
his
escape
unseen.
That
the
assailant
was
a
man
was
certain,
from
the
size
of
the
footprints
and
from
the
nature
of
the
injuries.
But
beyond
that
point
the
police
found
it
very
difficult
to
go.
There
were
no
signs
of
robbery,
and
the
doctor's
gold
watch
was
safe
in
his
pocket.
He
kept
a
heavy
cash
box
in
the
room,
and
this
was
discovered
to
be
locked
but
empty.
Mrs.
Woods
had
an
impression
that
a
large
sum
was
usually
kept
there,
but
the
doctor
had
paid
a
heavy
corn
bill
in
cash
only
that
very
day,
and
it
was
conjectured
that
it
was
to
this
and
not
to
a
robber
that
the
emptiness
of
the
box
was
due.
One
thing
in
the
room
was
missing
but
that
one
thing
was
suggestive.
The
portrait
of
Miss
Morton,
which
had
always
stood
upon
the
side
table,
had
been
taken
from
its
frame,
and
carried
off.
Mrs.
Woods
had
observed
it
there
when
she
waited
upon
her
employer
that
evening,
and
now
it
was
gone.
On
the
other
hand,
there
was
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
green
eye
patch,
which
the
housekeeper
could
not
remember
to
have
seen
before.
Such
a
patch
might,
however,
be
in
the
possession
of
a
doctor,
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
crime.
Suspicion
could
only
turn
in
one
direction,
and
Arthur
Morton,
the
young
squire,
was
immediately
arrested.
The
evidence
against
him
was
circumstantial,
but
damning.
He
was
devoted
to
his
sister,
and
it
was
shown
that
since
the
rupture
between
her
and
Dr.
Lana
he
had
been
heard
again
and
again
to
express
himself
in
the
most
vindictive
terms
towards
her
former
lover.
He
had,
as
stated,
been
seen
somewhere
about
eleven
o'clock
entering
the
doctor's
drive
with
a
hunting
crop
in
his
hand.
He
had
then,
according
to
the
theory
of
the
police,
broken
in
upon
the
doctor,
whose
exclamation
of
fear
or
of
anger
had
been
loud
enough
to
attract
