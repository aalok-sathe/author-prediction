upper
ones.
Of
the
twelve
jewels
eight
had
been
now
tampered
with
in
this
singular
fashion.
The
setting
of
the
lower
four
was
neat
and
smooth.
The
others
jagged
and
irregular.
"Have
the
stones
been
altered?"
I
asked.
"No,
I
am
certain
that
these
upper
four
are
the
same
which
the
expert
pronounced
to
be
genuine,
for
I
observed
yesterday
that
little
discoloration
on
the
edge
of
the
emerald.
Since
they
have
not
extracted
the
upper
stones,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
the
lower
have
been
transposed.
You
say
that
you
heard
nothing,
Simpson?"
"No,
sir,"
the
commissionaire
answered.
"But
when
I
made
my
round
after
daylight
I
had
a
special
look
at
these
stones,
and
I
saw
at
once
that
someone
had
been
meddling
with
them.
Then
I
called
you,
sir,
and
told
you.
I
was
backwards
and
forwards
all
night,
and
I
never
saw
a
soul
or
heard
a
sound."
"Come
up
and
have
some
breakfast
with
me,"
said
Mortimer,
and
he
took
me
into
his
own
chambers.
"Now,
what
DO
you
think
of
this,
Jackson?"
he
asked.
"It
is
the
most
objectless,
futile,
idiotic
business
that
ever
I
heard
of.
It
can
only
be
the
work
of
a
monomaniac."
"Can
you
put
forward
any
theory?"
A
curious
idea
came
into
my
head.
"This
object
is
a
Jewish
relic
of
great
antiquity
and
sanctity,"
said
I.
"How
about
the
anti
Semitic
movement?
Could
one
conceive
that
a
fanatic
of
that
way
of
thinking
might
desecrate
"
"No,
no,
no!"
cried
Mortimer.
"That
will
never
do!
Such
a
man
might
push
his
lunacy
to
the
length
of
destroying
a
Jewish
relic,
but
why
on
earth
should
he
nibble
round
every
stone
so
carefully
that
he
can
only
do
four
stones
in
a
night?
We
must
have
a
better
solution
than
that,
and
we
must
find
it
for
ourselves,
for
I
do
not
think
that
our
inspector
is
likely
to
help
us.
First
of
all,
what
do
you
think
of
Simpson,
the
porter?"
"Have
you
any
reason
to
suspect
him?"
"Only
that
he
is
the
one
person
on
the
premises."
"But
why
should
he
indulge
in
such
wanton
destruction?
Nothing
has
been
taken
away.
He
has
no
motive."
"Mania?"
"No,
I
will
swear
to
his
sanity."
"Have
you
any
other
theory?"
"Well,
yourself,
for
example.
You
are
not
a
somnambulist,
by
any
chance?"
"Nothing
of
the
sort,
I
assure
you."
"Then
I
give
it
up."
"But
I
don't
and
I
have
a
plan
by
which
we
will
make
it
all
clear."
"To
visit
Professor
Andreas?"
"No,
we
shall
find
our
solution
nearer
than
Scotland.
I
will
tell
you
what
we
shall
do.
You
know
that
skylight
which
overlooks
the
central
hall?
We
will
leave
the
electric
lights
in
the
hall,
and
we
will
keep
watch
in
the
lumber
room,
you
and
I,
and
solve
the
mystery
for
ourselves.
If
our
mysterious
visitor
is
doing
four
stones
at
a
time,
he
has
four
still
to
do,
and
there
is
every
