the
facts
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
them.
They
are
collated
from
the
Liverpool
papers
of
that
date,
from
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
upon
John
Slater,
the
engine
driver,
and
from
the
records
of
the
London
and
West
Coast
Railway
Company,
which
have
been
courteously
put
at
my
disposal.
Briefly,
they
are
as
follows:
On
the
3rd
of
June,
1890,
a
gentleman,
who
gave
his
name
as
Monsieur
Louis
Caratal,
desired
an
interview
with
Mr.
James
Bland,
the
superintendent
of
the
London
and
West
Coast
Central
Station
in
Liverpool.
He
was
a
small
man,
middle
aged
and
dark,
with
a
stoop
which
was
so
marked
that
it
suggested
some
deformity
of
the
spine.
He
was
accompanied
by
a
friend,
a
man
of
imposing
physique,
whose
deferential
manner
and
constant
attention
showed
that
his
position
was
one
of
dependence.
This
friend
or
companion,
whose
name
did
not
transpire,
was
certainly
a
foreigner,
and
probably
from
his
swarthy
complexion,
either
a
Spaniard
or
a
South
American.
One
peculiarity
was
observed
in
him.
He
carried
in
his
left
hand
a
small
black,
leather
dispatch
box,
and
it
was
noticed
by
a
sharp
eyed
clerk
in
the
Central
office
that
this
box
was
fastened
to
his
wrist
by
a
strap.
No
importance
was
attached
to
the
fact
at
the
time,
but
subsequent
events
endowed
it
with
some
significance.
Monsieur
Caratal
was
shown
up
to
Mr.
Bland's
office,
while
his
companion
remained
outside.
Monsieur
Caratal's
business
was
quickly
dispatched.
He
had
arrived
that
afternoon
from
Central
America.
Affairs
of
the
utmost
importance
demanded
that
he
should
be
in
Paris
without
the
loss
of
an
unnecessary
hour.
He
had
missed
the
London
express.
A
special
must
be
provided.
Money
was
of
no
importance.
Time
was
everything.
If
the
company
would
speed
him
on
his
way,
they
might
make
their
own
terms.
Mr.
Bland
struck
the
electric
bell,
summoned
Mr.
Potter
Hood,
the
traffic
manager,
and
had
the
matter
arranged
in
five
minutes.
The
train
would
start
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour.
It
would
take
that
time
to
insure
that
the
line
should
be
clear.
The
powerful
engine
called
Rochdale
(No.
247
on
the
company's
register)
was
attached
to
two
carriages,
with
a
guard's
van
behind.
The
first
carriage
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
decreasing
the
inconvenience
arising
from
the
oscillation.
The
second
was
divided,
as
usual,
into
four
compartments,
a
first
class,
a
first
class
smoking,
a
second
class,
and
a
second
class
smoking.
The
first
compartment,
which
was
nearest
to
the
engine,
was
the
one
allotted
to
the
travellers.
The
other
three
were
empty.
The
guard
of
the
special
train
was
James
McPherson,
who
had
been
some
years
in
the
service
of
the
company.
The
stoker,
William
Smith,
was
a
new
hand.
Monsieur
Caratal,
upon
leaving
the
superintendent's
office,
rejoined
his
companion,
and
both
of
them
manifested
extreme
impatience
to
be
off.
Having
paid
the
money
asked,
which
amounted
to
fifty
pounds
five
shillings,
at
the
usual
special
