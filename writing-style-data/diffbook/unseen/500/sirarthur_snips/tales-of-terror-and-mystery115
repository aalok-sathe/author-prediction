fuller
knowledge
of
the
life
of
the
man
whom
I
served.
The
immediate
cause
of
this
was
no
less
than
the
falling
of
Master
Percy,
the
youngest
of
my
pupils,
into
the
mill
race,
with
imminent
danger
both
to
his
life
and
to
mine,
since
I
had
to
risk
myself
in
order
to
save
him.
Dripping
and
exhausted
for
I
was
far
more
spent
than
the
child
I
was
making
for
my
room
when
Sir
John,
who
had
heard
the
hubbub,
opened
the
door
of
his
little
study
and
asked
me
what
was
the
matter.
I
told
him
of
the
accident,
but
assured
him
that
his
child
was
in
no
danger,
while
he
listened
with
a
rugged,
immobile
face,
which
expressed
in
its
intense
eyes
and
tightened
lips
all
the
emotion
which
he
tried
to
conceal.
"One
moment!
Step
in
here!
Let
me
have
the
details!"
said
he,
turning
back
through
the
open
door.
And
so
I
found
myself
within
that
little
sanctum,
inside
which,
as
I
afterwards
learned,
no
other
foot
had
for
three
years
been
set
save
that
of
the
old
servant
who
cleaned
it
out.
It
was
a
round
room,
conforming
to
the
shape
of
the
tower
in
which
it
was
situated,
with
a
low
ceiling,
a
single
narrow,
ivy
wreathed
window,
and
the
simplest
of
furniture.
An
old
carpet,
a
single
chair,
a
deal
table,
and
a
small
shelf
of
books
made
up
the
whole
contents.
On
the
table
stood
a
full
length
photograph
of
a
woman
I
took
no
particular
notice
of
the
features,
but
I
remember,
that
a
certain
gracious
gentleness
was
the
prevailing
impression.
Beside
it
were
a
large
black
japanned
box
and
one
or
two
bundles
of
letters
or
papers
fastened
together
with
elastic
bands.
Our
interview
was
a
short
one,
for
Sir
John
Bollamore
perceived
that
I
was
soaked,
and
that
I
should
change
without
delay.
The
incident
led,
however,
to
an
instructive
talk
with
Richards,
the
agent,
who
had
never
penetrated
into
the
chamber
which
chance
had
opened
to
me.
That
very
afternoon
he
came
to
me,
all
curiosity,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
path
with
me,
while
my
two
charges
played
tennis
upon
the
lawn
beside
us.
"You
hardly
realize
the
exception
which
has
been
made
in
your
favour,"
said
he.
"That
room
has
been
kept
such
a
mystery,
and
Sir
John's
visits
to
it
have
been
so
regular
and
consistent,
that
an
almost
superstitious
feeling
has
arisen
about
it
in
the
household.
I
assure
you
that
if
I
were
to
repeat
to
you
the
tales
which
are
flying
about,
tales
of
mysterious
visitors
there,
and
of
voices
overheard
by
the
servants,
you
might
suspect
that
Sir
John
had
relapsed
into
his
old
ways."
"Why
do
you
say
relapsed?"
I
asked.
He
looked
at
me
in
surprise.
"Is
it
possible,"
said
he,
"that
Sir
John
Bollamore's
previous
history
is
unknown
to
you?"
"Absolutely."
"You
astound
me.
I
thought
that
every
man
in
England
knew
something
of
his
