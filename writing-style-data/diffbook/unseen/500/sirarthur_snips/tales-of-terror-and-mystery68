billiard
room.
I
had
gone
down
on
my
own
account
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
cat.
I
had
entered
the
room
without
observing
that
the
cage
was
opened,
and
I
had
been
caught.
How
could
such
a
crime
be
brought
home
to
him?
Suspicion,
perhaps
but
proof,
never!
How
slowly
those
dreadful
two
hours
went
by!
Once
I
heard
a
low,
rasping
sound,
which
I
took
to
be
the
creature
licking
its
own
fur.
Several
times
those
greenish
eyes
gleamed
at
me
through
the
darkness,
but
never
in
a
fixed
stare,
and
my
hopes
grew
stronger
that
my
presence
had
been
forgotten
or
ignored.
At
last
the
least
faint
glimmer
of
light
came
through
the
windows
I
first
dimly
saw
them
as
two
grey
squares
upon
the
black
wall,
then
grey
turned
to
white,
and
I
could
see
my
terrible
companion
once
more.
And
he,
alas,
could
see
me!
It
was
evident
to
me
at
once
that
he
was
in
a
much
more
dangerous
and
aggressive
mood
than
when
I
had
seen
him
last.
The
cold
of
the
morning
had
irritated
him,
and
he
was
hungry
as
well.
With
a
continual
growl
he
paced
swiftly
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
room
which
was
farthest
from
my
refuge,
his
whiskers
bristling
angrily,
and
his
tail
switching
and
lashing.
As
he
turned
at
the
corners
his
savage
eyes
always
looked
upwards
at
me
with
a
dreadful
menace.
I
knew
then
that
he
meant
to
kill
me.
Yet
I
found
myself
even
at
that
moment
admiring
the
sinuous
grace
of
the
devilish
thing,
its
long,
undulating,
rippling
movements,
the
gloss
of
its
beautiful
flanks,
the
vivid,
palpitating
scarlet
of
the
glistening
tongue
which
hung
from
the
jet
black
muzzle.
And
all
the
time
that
deep,
threatening
growl
was
rising
and
rising
in
an
unbroken
crescendo.
I
knew
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand.
It
was
a
miserable
hour
to
meet
such
a
death
so
cold,
so
comfortless,
shivering
in
my
light
dress
clothes
upon
this
gridiron
of
torment
upon
which
I
was
stretched.
I
tried
to
brace
myself
to
it,
to
raise
my
soul
above
it,
and
at
the
same
time,
with
the
lucidity
which
comes
to
a
perfectly
desperate
man,
I
cast
round
for
some
possible
means
of
escape.
One
thing
was
clear
to
me.
If
that
front
of
the
cage
was
only
back
in
its
position
once
more,
I
could
find
a
sure
refuge
behind
it.
Could
I
possibly
pull
it
back?
I
hardly
dared
to
move
for
fear
of
bringing
the
creature
upon
me.
Slowly,
very
slowly,
I
put
my
hand
forward
until
it
grasped
the
edge
of
the
front,
the
final
bar
which
protruded
through
the
wall.
To
my
surprise
it
came
quite
easily
to
my
jerk.
Of
course
the
difficulty
of
drawing
it
out
arose
from
the
fact
that
I
was
clinging
to
it.
I
pulled
again,
and
three
inches
of
it
came
through.
It
ran
apparently
on
wheels.
I
pulled
again
...
and
