his
arm.
"No
doubt
you
are
quite
right
not
to
answer,
and
no
doubt
I
am
quite
right
also
and
so
again,
my
dear
Kennedy,
good
night!"
The
Englishman
watched
Burger
cross
the
room,
and
he
had
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
before
his
host
sprang
up
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
making
the
best
of
that
which
cannot
be
helped.
"Hold
on,
old
fellow,"
said
he;
"I
think
you
are
behaving
in
a
most
ridiculous
fashion;
but
still;
if
this
is
your
condition,
I
suppose
that
I
must
submit
to
it.
I
hate
saying
anything
about
a
girl,
but,
as
you
say,
it
is
all
over
Rome,
and
I
don't
suppose
I
can
tell
you
anything
which
you
do
not
know
already.
What
was
it
you
wanted
to
know?"
The
German
came
back
to
the
stove,
and,
laying
down
his
basket,
he
sank
into
his
chair
once
more.
"May
I
have
another
cigar?"
said
he.
"Thank
you
very
much!
I
never
smoke
when
I
work,
but
I
enjoy
a
chat
much
more
when
I
am
under
the
influence
of
tobacco.
Now,
as
regards
this
young
lady,
with
whom
you
had
this
little
adventure.
What
in
the
world
has
become
of
her?"
"She
is
at
home
with
her
own
people."
"Oh,
really
in
England?"
"Yes."
"What
part
of
England
London?"
"No,
Twickenham."
"You
must
excuse
my
curiosity,
my
dear
Kennedy,
and
you
must
put
it
down
to
my
ignorance
of
the
world.
No
doubt
it
is
quite
a
simple
thing
to
persuade
a
young
lady
to
go
off
with
you
for
three
weeks
or
so,
and
then
to
hand
her
over
to
her
own
family
at
what
did
you
call
the
place?"
"Twickenham."
"Quite
so
at
Twickenham.
But
it
is
something
so
entirely
outside
my
own
experience
that
I
cannot
even
imagine
how
you
set
about
it.
For
example,
if
you
had
loved
this
girl
your
love
could
hardly
disappear
in
three
weeks,
so
I
presume
that
you
could
not
have
loved
her
at
all.
But
if
you
did
not
love
her
why
should
you
make
this
great
scandal
which
has
damaged
you
and
ruined
her?"
Kennedy
looked
moodily
into
the
red
eye
of
the
stove.
"That's
a
logical
way
of
looking
at
it,
certainly,"
said
he.
"Love
is
a
big
word,
and
it
represents
a
good
many
different
shades
of
feeling.
I
liked
her,
and
well,
you
say
you've
seen
her
you
know
how
charming
she
could
look.
But
still
I
am
willing
to
admit,
looking
back,
that
I
could
never
have
really
loved
her."
"Then,
my
dear
Kennedy,
why
did
you
do
it?"
"The
adventure
of
the
thing
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it."
"What!
You
are
so
fond
of
adventures!"
"Where
would
the
variety
of
life
be
without
them?
It
was
for
an
adventure
that
I
first
began
to
pay
my
attentions
to
her.
I've
chased
a
good
deal
of
game
in
my
time,
but
there's
no
chase
like
