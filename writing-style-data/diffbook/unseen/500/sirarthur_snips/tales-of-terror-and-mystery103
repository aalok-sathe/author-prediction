of
the
affair
might
be
surmised
without
any
great
breach
of
probability.
But
what
the
second
stage
had
been,
or
how
the
final
one
had
been
arrived
at,
neither
the
guard
nor
the
experienced
detective
officers
could
suggest.
A
careful
examination
of
the
line
between
Willesden
and
Rugby
resulted
in
one
discovery
which
might
or
might
not
have
a
bearing
upon
the
tragedy.
Near
Tring,
at
the
very
place
where
the
train
slowed
down,
there
was
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
embankment
a
small
pocket
Testament,
very
shabby
and
worn.
It
was
printed
by
the
Bible
Society
of
London,
and
bore
an
inscription:
"From
John
to
Alice.
Jan.
13th,
1856,"
upon
the
fly
leaf.
Underneath
was
written:
"James.
July
4th,
1859,"
and
beneath
that
again:
"Edward.
Nov.
1st,
1869,"
all
the
entries
being
in
the
same
handwriting.
This
was
the
only
clue,
if
it
could
be
called
a
clue,
which
the
police
obtained,
and
the
coroner's
verdict
of
"Murder
by
a
person
or
persons
unknown"
was
the
unsatisfactory
ending
of
a
singular
case.
Advertisement,
rewards,
and
inquiries
proved
equally
fruitless,
and
nothing
could
be
found
which
was
solid
enough
to
form
the
basis
for
a
profitable
investigation.
It
would
be
a
mistake,
however,
to
suppose
that
no
theories
were
formed
to
account
for
the
facts.
On
the
contrary,
the
Press,
both
in
England
and
in
America,
teemed
with
suggestions
and
suppositions,
most
of
which
were
obviously
absurd.
The
fact
that
the
watches
were
of
American
make,
and
some
peculiarities
in
connection
with
the
gold
stopping
of
his
front
tooth,
appeared
to
indicate
that
the
deceased
was
a
citizen
of
the
United
States,
though
his
linen,
clothes
and
boots
were
undoubtedly
of
British
manufacture.
It
was
surmised,
by
some,
that
he
was
concealed
under
the
seat,
and
that,
being
discovered,
he
was
for
some
reason,
possibly
because
he
had
overheard
their
guilty
secrets,
put
to
death
by
his
fellow
passengers.
When
coupled
with
generalities
as
to
the
ferocity
and
cunning
of
anarchical
and
other
secret
societies,
this
theory
sounded
as
plausible
as
any.
The
fact
that
he
should
be
without
a
ticket
would
be
consistent
with
the
idea
of
concealment,
and
it
was
well
known
that
women
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
Nihilistic
propaganda.
On
the
other
hand,
it
was
clear,
from
the
guard's
statement,
that
the
man
must
have
been
hidden
there
BEFORE
the
others
arrived,
and
how
unlikely
the
coincidence
that
conspirators
should
stray
exactly
into
the
very
compartment
in
which
a
spy
was
already
concealed!
Besides,
this
explanation
ignored
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage,
and
gave
no
reason
at
all
for
his
simultaneous
disappearance.
The
police
had
little
difficulty
in
showing
that
such
a
theory
would
not
cover
the
facts,
but
they
were
unprepared
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
advance
any
alternative
explanation.
There
was
a
letter
in
the
Daily
Gazette,
over
the
signature
of
a
well
known
criminal
investigator,
which
gave
rise
to
considerable
discussion
at
the
time.
He
had
formed
a
hypothesis
