recounted
to
him
my
whole
strange
experience.
He
listened
intently,
and
then
carefully
examined
me,
paying
special
attention
to
my
reflexes
and
to
the
pupils
of
my
eyes.
When
he
had
finished,
he
refused
to
discuss
my
adventure,
saying
that
it
was
entirely
beyond
him,
but
he
gave
me
the
card
of
a
Mr.
Picton
at
Castleton,
with
the
advice
that
I
should
instantly
go
to
him
and
tell
him
the
story
exactly
as
I
had
done
to
himself.
He
was,
according
to
my
adviser,
the
very
man
who
was
pre
eminently
suited
to
help
me.
I
went
on
to
the
station,
therefore,
and
made
my
way
to
the
little
town,
which
is
some
ten
miles
away.
Mr.
Picton
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
importance,
as
his
brass
plate
was
displayed
upon
the
door
of
a
considerable
building
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town.
I
was
about
to
ring
his
bell,
when
some
misgiving
came
into
my
mind,
and,
crossing
to
a
neighbouring
shop,
I
asked
the
man
behind
the
counter
if
he
could
tell
me
anything
of
Mr.
Picton.
"Why,"
said
he,
"he
is
the
best
mad
doctor
in
Derbyshire,
and
yonder
is
his
asylum."
You
can
imagine
that
it
was
not
long
before
I
had
shaken
the
dust
of
Castleton
from
my
feet
and
returned
to
the
farm,
cursing
all
unimaginative
pedants
who
cannot
conceive
that
there
may
be
things
in
creation
which
have
never
yet
chanced
to
come
across
their
mole's
vision.
After
all,
now
that
I
am
cooler,
I
can
afford
to
admit
that
I
have
been
no
more
sympathetic
to
Armitage
than
Dr.
Johnson
has
been
to
me.
April
27.
When
I
was
a
student
I
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
courage
and
enterprise.
I
remember
that
when
there
was
a
ghost
hunt
at
Coltbridge
it
was
I
who
sat
up
in
the
haunted
house.
Is
it
advancing
years
(after
all,
I
am
only
thirty
five),
or
is
it
this
physical
malady
which
has
caused
degeneration?
Certainly
my
heart
quails
when
I
think
of
that
horrible
cavern
in
the
hill,
and
the
certainty
that
it
has
some
monstrous
occupant.
What
shall
I
do?
There
is
not
an
hour
in
the
day
that
I
do
not
debate
the
question.
If
I
say
nothing,
then
the
mystery
remains
unsolved.
If
I
do
say
anything,
then
I
have
the
alternative
of
mad
alarm
over
the
whole
countryside,
or
of
absolute
incredulity
which
may
end
in
consigning
me
to
an
asylum.
On
the
whole,
I
think
that
my
best
course
is
to
wait,
and
to
prepare
for
some
expedition
which
shall
be
more
deliberate
and
better
thought
out
than
the
last.
As
a
first
step
I
have
been
to
Castleton
and
obtained
a
few
essentials
a
large
acetylene
lantern
for
one
thing,
and
a
good
double
barrelled
sporting
rifle
for
another.
The
latter
I
have
hired,
but
I
have
bought
a
dozen
heavy
game
cartridges,
which
would
bring
down
a
rhinoceros.
Now
I
am
ready
