we
had
passed
the
gates
of
Greylands
Park
we
had
ample
evidence
of
this
taste
of
his.
Some
small
spotted
deer,
a
curious
wild
pig
known,
I
believe,
as
a
peccary,
a
gorgeously
feathered
oriole,
some
sort
of
armadillo,
and
a
singular
lumbering
in
toed
beast
like
a
very
fat
badger,
were
among
the
creatures
which
I
observed
as
we
drove
along
the
winding
avenue.
Mr.
Everard
King,
my
unknown
cousin,
was
standing
in
person
upon
the
steps
of
his
house,
for
he
had
seen
us
in
the
distance,
and
guessed
that
it
was
I.
His
appearance
was
very
homely
and
benevolent,
short
and
stout,
forty
five
years
old,
perhaps,
with
a
round,
good
humoured
face,
burned
brown
with
the
tropical
sun,
and
shot
with
a
thousand
wrinkles.
He
wore
white
linen
clothes,
in
true
planter
style,
with
a
cigar
between
his
lips,
and
a
large
Panama
hat
upon
the
back
of
his
head.
It
was
such
a
figure
as
one
associates
with
a
verandahed
bungalow,
and
it
looked
curiously
out
of
place
in
front
of
this
broad,
stone
English
mansion,
with
its
solid
wings
and
its
Palladio
pillars
before
the
doorway.
"My
dear!"
he
cried,
glancing
over
his
shoulder;
"my
dear,
here
is
our
guest!
Welcome,
welcome
to
Greylands!
I
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance,
Cousin
Marshall,
and
I
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
that
you
should
honour
this
sleepy
little
country
place
with
your
presence."
Nothing
could
be
more
hearty
than
his
manner,
and
he
set
me
at
my
ease
in
an
instant.
But
it
needed
all
his
cordiality
to
atone
for
the
frigidity
and
even
rudeness
of
his
wife,
a
tall,
haggard
woman,
who
came
forward
at
his
summons.
She
was,
I
believe,
of
Brazilian
extraction,
though
she
spoke
excellent
English,
and
I
excused
her
manners
on
the
score
of
her
ignorance
of
our
customs.
She
did
not
attempt
to
conceal,
however,
either
then
or
afterwards,
that
I
was
no
very
welcome
visitor
at
Greylands
Court.
Her
actual
words
were,
as
a
rule,
courteous,
but
she
was
the
possessor
of
a
pair
of
particularly
expressive
dark
eyes,
and
I
read
in
them
very
clearly
from
the
first
that
she
heartily
wished
me
back
in
London
once
more.
However,
my
debts
were
too
pressing
and
my
designs
upon
my
wealthy
relative
were
too
vital
for
me
to
allow
them
to
be
upset
by
the
ill
temper
of
his
wife,
so
I
disregarded
her
coldness
and
reciprocated
the
extreme
cordiality
of
his
welcome.
No
pains
had
been
spared
by
him
to
make
me
comfortable.
My
room
was
a
charming
one.
He
implored
me
to
tell
him
anything
which
could
add
to
my
happiness.
It
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
inform
him
that
a
blank
cheque
would
materially
help
towards
that
end,
but
I
felt
that
it
might
be
premature
in
the
present
state
of
our
acquaintance.
The
dinner
was
excellent,
and
as
we
sat
together
afterwards
over
his
Havanas
and
coffee,
which
later
he
