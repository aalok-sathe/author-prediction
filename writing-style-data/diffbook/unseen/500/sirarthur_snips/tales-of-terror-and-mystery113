all
this
explanation,
if
you
could
do
it
for
me.
You
remember
that
Testament
that
was
picked
up.
I
always
carried
it
in
my
inside
pocket,
and
it
must
have
come
out
in
my
fall.
I
value
it
very
highly,
for
it
was
the
family
book
with
my
birth
and
my
brother's
marked
by
my
father
in
the
beginning
of
it.
I
wish
you
would
apply
at
the
proper
place
and
have
it
sent
to
me.
It
can
be
of
no
possible
value
to
anyone
else.
If
you
address
it
to
X,
Bassano's
Library,
Broadway,
New
York,
it
is
sure
to
come
to
hand."
The
Japanned
Box
It
WAS
a
curious
thing,
said
the
private
tutor;
one
of
those
grotesque
and
whimsical
incidents
which
occur
to
one
as
one
goes
through
life.
I
lost
the
best
situation
which
I
am
ever
likely
to
have
through
it.
But
I
am
glad
that
I
went
to
Thorpe
Place,
for
I
gained
well,
as
I
tell
you
the
story
you
will
learn
what
I
gained.
I
don't
know
whether
you
are
familiar
with
that
part
of
the
Midlands
which
is
drained
by
the
Avon.
It
is
the
most
English
part
of
England.
Shakespeare,
the
flower
of
the
whole
race,
was
born
right
in
the
middle
of
it.
It
is
a
land
of
rolling
pastures,
rising
in
higher
folds
to
the
westwards,
until
they
swell
into
the
Malvern
Hills.
There
are
no
towns,
but
numerous
villages,
each
with
its
grey
Norman
church.
You
have
left
the
brick
of
the
southern
and
eastern
counties
behind
you,
and
everything
is
stone
stone
for
the
walls,
and
lichened
slabs
of
stone
for
the
roofs.
It
is
all
grim
and
solid
and
massive,
as
befits
the
heart
of
a
great
nation.
It
was
in
the
middle
of
this
country,
not
very
far
from
Evesham,
that
Sir
John
Bollamore
lived
in
the
old
ancestral
home
of
Thorpe
Place,
and
thither
it
was
that
I
came
to
teach
his
two
little
sons.
Sir
John
was
a
widower
his
wife
had
died
three
years
before
and
he
had
been
left
with
these
two
lads
aged
eight
and
ten,
and
one
dear
little
girl
of
seven.
Miss
Witherton,
who
is
now
my
wife,
was
governess
to
this
little
girl.
I
was
tutor
to
the
two
boys.
Could
there
be
a
more
obvious
prelude
to
an
engagement?
She
governs
me
now,
and
I
tutor
two
little
boys
of
our
own.
But,
there
I
have
already
revealed
what
it
was
which
I
gained
in
Thorpe
Place!
It
was
a
very,
very
old
house,
incredibly
old
pre
Norman,
some
of
it
and
the
Bollamores
claimed
to
have
lived
in
that
situation
since
long
before
the
Conquest.
It
struck
a
chill
to
my
heart
when
first
I
came
there,
those
enormously
thick
grey
walls,
the
rude
crumbling
stones,
the
smell
as
from
a
sick
animal
which
exhaled
from
the
rotting
plaster
of
the
aged
building.
But
the
modern
wing
was
bright
and
the
garden
was
well
