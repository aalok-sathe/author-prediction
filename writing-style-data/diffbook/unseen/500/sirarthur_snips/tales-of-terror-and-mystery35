time
of
this
little
incident.
Those
who
knew
him
best
were
aware
that
famous
as
he
was
as
a
surgeon,
he
might
have
succeeded
with
even
greater
rapidity
in
any
of
a
dozen
lines
of
life.
He
could
have
cut
his
way
to
fame
as
a
soldier,
struggled
to
it
as
an
explorer,
bullied
for
it
in
the
courts,
or
built
it
out
of
stone
and
iron
as
an
engineer.
He
was
born
to
be
great,
for
he
could
plan
what
another
man
dare
not
do,
and
he
could
do
what
another
man
dare
not
plan.
In
surgery
none
could
follow
him.
His
nerve,
his
judgement,
his
intuition,
were
things
apart.
Again
and
again
his
knife
cut
away
death,
but
grazed
the
very
springs
of
life
in
doing
it,
until
his
assistants
were
as
white
as
the
patient.
His
energy,
his
audacity,
his
full
blooded
self
confidence
does
not
the
memory
of
them
still
linger
to
the
south
of
Marylebone
Road
and
the
north
of
Oxford
Street?
His
vices
were
as
magnificent
as
his
virtues,
and
infinitely
more
picturesque.
Large
as
was
his
income,
and
it
was
the
third
largest
of
all
professional
men
in
London,
it
was
far
beneath
the
luxury
of
his
living.
Deep
in
his
complex
nature
lay
a
rich
vein
of
sensualism,
at
the
sport
of
which
he
placed
all
the
prizes
of
his
life.
The
eye,
the
ear,
the
touch,
the
palate,
all
were
his
masters.
The
bouquet
of
old
vintages,
the
scent
of
rare
exotics,
the
curves
and
tints
of
the
daintiest
potteries
of
Europe,
it
was
to
these
that
the
quick
running
stream
of
gold
was
transformed.
And
then
there
came
his
sudden
mad
passion
for
Lady
Sannox,
when
a
single
interview
with
two
challenging
glances
and
a
whispered
word
set
him
ablaze.
She
was
the
loveliest
woman
in
London
and
the
only
one
to
him.
He
was
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
London,
but
not
the
only
one
to
her.
She
had
a
liking
for
new
experiences,
and
was
gracious
to
most
men
who
wooed
her.
It
may
have
been
cause
or
it
may
have
been
effect
that
Lord
Sannox
looked
fifty,
though
he
was
but
six
and
thirty.
He
was
a
quiet,
silent,
neutral
tinted
man,
this
lord,
with
thin
lips
and
heavy
eyelids,
much
given
to
gardening,
and
full
of
home
like
habits.
He
had
at
one
time
been
fond
of
acting,
had
even
rented
a
theatre
in
London,
and
on
its
boards
had
first
seen
Miss
Marion
Dawson,
to
whom
he
had
offered
his
hand,
his
title,
and
the
third
of
a
county.
Since
his
marriage
his
early
hobby
had
become
distasteful
to
him.
Even
in
private
theatricals
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
persuade
him
to
exercise
the
talent
which
he
had
often
showed
that
he
possessed.
He
was
happier
with
a
spud
and
a
watering
can
among
his
orchids
and
chrysanthemums.
It
was
quite
an
interesting
problem
whether
he
was
absolutely
devoid
of
sense,
or
miserably
