"Nevertheless,
when
I
dined
at
Rheims
with
Coselli
and
Gustav
Raymond
I
found
that
neither
of
them
was
aware
of
any
particular
danger
in
the
higher
layers
of
the
atmosphere.
I
did
not
actually
say
what
was
in
my
thoughts,
but
I
got
so
near
to
it
that
if
they
had
any
corresponding
idea
they
could
not
have
failed
to
express
it.
But
then
they
are
two
empty,
vainglorious
fellows
with
no
thought
beyond
seeing
their
silly
names
in
the
newspaper.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
neither
of
them
had
ever
been
much
beyond
the
twenty
thousand
foot
level.
Of
course,
men
have
been
higher
than
this
both
in
balloons
and
in
the
ascent
of
mountains.
It
must
be
well
above
that
point
that
the
aeroplane
enters
the
danger
zone
always
presuming
that
my
premonitions
are
correct.
"Aeroplaning
has
been
with
us
now
for
more
than
twenty
years,
and
one
might
well
ask:
Why
should
this
peril
be
only
revealing
itself
in
our
day?
The
answer
is
obvious.
In
the
old
days
of
weak
engines,
when
a
hundred
horse
power
Gnome
or
Green
was
considered
ample
for
every
need,
the
flights
were
very
restricted.
Now
that
three
hundred
horse
power
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception,
visits
to
the
upper
layers
have
become
easier
and
more
common.
Some
of
us
can
remember
how,
in
our
youth,
Garros
made
a
world
wide
reputation
by
attaining
nineteen
thousand
feet,
and
it
was
considered
a
remarkable
achievement
to
fly
over
the
Alps.
Our
standard
now
has
been
immeasurably
raised,
and
there
are
twenty
high
flights
for
one
in
former
years.
Many
of
them
have
been
undertaken
with
impunity.
The
thirty
thousand
foot
level
has
been
reached
time
after
time
with
no
discomfort
beyond
cold
and
asthma.
What
does
this
prove?
A
visitor
might
descend
upon
this
planet
a
thousand
times
and
never
see
a
tiger.
Yet
tigers
exist,
and
if
he
chanced
to
come
down
into
a
jungle
he
might
be
devoured.
There
are
jungles
of
the
upper
air,
and
there
are
worse
things
than
tigers
which
inhabit
them.
I
believe
in
time
they
will
map
these
jungles
accurately
out.
Even
at
the
present
moment
I
could
name
two
of
them.
One
of
them
lies
over
the
Pau
Biarritz
district
of
France.
Another
is
just
over
my
head
as
I
write
here
in
my
house
in
Wiltshire.
I
rather
think
there
is
a
third
in
the
Homburg
Wiesbaden
district.
"It
was
the
disappearance
of
the
airmen
that
first
set
me
thinking.
Of
course,
everyone
said
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
sea,
but
that
did
not
satisfy
me
at
all.
First,
there
was
Verrier
in
France;
his
machine
was
found
near
Bayonne,
but
they
never
got
his
body.
There
was
the
case
of
Baxter
also,
who
vanished,
though
his
engine
and
some
of
the
iron
fixings
were
found
in
a
wood
in
Leicestershire.
In
that
case,
Dr.
Middleton,
of
Amesbury,

was
