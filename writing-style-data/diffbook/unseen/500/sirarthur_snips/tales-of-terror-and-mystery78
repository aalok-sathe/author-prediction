solution
remained
as
far
off
as
ever.
In
broad
daylight,
upon
a
June
afternoon
in
the
most
thickly
inhabited
portion
of
England,
a
train
with
its
occupants
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
some
master
of
subtle
chemistry
had
volatilized
it
into
gas.
Indeed,
among
the
various
conjectures
which
were
put
forward
in
the
public
Press,
there
were
some
which
seriously
asserted
that
supernatural,
or,
at
least,
preternatural,
agencies
had
been
at
work,
and
that
the
deformed
Monsieur
Caratal
was
probably
a
person
who
was
better
known
under
a
less
polite
name.
Others
fixed
upon
his
swarthy
companion
as
being
the
author
of
the
mischief,
but
what
it
was
exactly
which
he
had
done
could
never
be
clearly
formulated
in
words.
Amongst
the
many
suggestions
put
forward
by
various
newspapers
or
private
individuals,
there
were
one
or
two
which
were
feasible
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
public.
One
which
appeared
in
The
Times,
over
the
signature
of
an
amateur
reasoner
of
some
celebrity
at
that
date,
attempted
to
deal
with
the
matter
in
a
critical
and
semi
scientific
manner.
An
extract
must
suffice,
although
the
curious
can
see
the
whole
letter
in
the
issue
of
the
3rd
of
July.
"It
is
one
of
the
elementary
principles
of
practical
reasoning,"
he
remarked,
"that
when
the
impossible
has
been
eliminated
the
residuum,
HOWEVER
IMPROBABLE,
must
contain
the
truth.
It
is
certain
that
the
train
left
Kenyon
Junction.
It
is
certain
that
it
did
not
reach
Barton
Moss.
It
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely,
but
still
possible,
that
it
may
have
taken
one
of
the
seven
available
side
lines.
It
is
obviously
impossible
for
a
train
to
run
where
there
are
no
rails,
and,
therefore,
we
may
reduce
our
improbables
to
the
three
open
lines,
namely
the
Carnstock
Iron
Works,
the
Big
Ben,
and
the
Perseverance.
Is
there
a
secret
society
of
colliers,
an
English
Camorra,
which
is
capable
of
destroying
both
train
and
passengers?
It
is
improbable,
but
it
is
not
impossible.
I
confess
that
I
am
unable
to
suggest
any
other
solution.
I
should
certainly
advise
the
company
to
direct
all
their
energies
towards
the
observation
of
those
three
lines,
and
of
the
workmen
at
the
end
of
them.
A
careful
supervision
of
the
pawnbrokers'
shops
of
the
district
might
possibly
bring
some
suggestive
facts
to
light."
The
suggestion
coming
from
a
recognized
authority
upon
such
matters
created
considerable
interest,
and
a
fierce
opposition
from
those
who
considered
such
a
statement
to
be
a
preposterous
libel
upon
an
honest
and
deserving
set
of
men.
The
only
answer
to
this
criticism
was
a
challenge
to
the
objectors
to
lay
any
more
feasible
explanations
before
the
public.
In
reply
to
this
two
others
were
forthcoming
(Times,
July
7th
and
9th).
The
first
suggested
that
the
train
might
have
run
off
the
metals
and
be
lying
submerged
in
the
Lancashire
and
Staffordshire
Canal,
which
runs
parallel
to
the
railway
for
some
hundred
of
yards.
This
suggestion
was
thrown
out
of
court
