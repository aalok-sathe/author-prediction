her
without
shame
when
He
is
pleased
to
reunite
us!
That
is
my
secret,
Mr.
Colmore,
and
whilst
I
live
I
leave
it
in
your
keeping."
The
Black
Doctor
Bishop's
Crossing
is
a
small
village
lying
ten
miles
in
a
south
westerly
direction
from
Liverpool.
Here
in
the
early
seventies
there
settled
a
doctor
named
Aloysius
Lana.
Nothing
was
known
locally
either
of
his
antecedents
or
of
the
reasons
which
had
prompted
him
to
come
to
this
Lancashire
hamlet.
Two
facts
only
were
certain
about
him;
the
one
that
he
had
gained
his
medical
qualification
with
some
distinction
at
Glasgow;
the
other
that
he
came
undoubtedly
of
a
tropical
race,
and
was
so
dark
that
he
might
almost
have
had
a
strain
of
the
Indian
in
his
composition.
His
predominant
features
were,
however,
European,
and
he
possessed
a
stately
courtesy
and
carriage
which
suggested
a
Spanish
extraction.
A
swarthy
skin,
raven
black
hair,
and
dark,
sparkling
eyes
under
a
pair
of
heavily
tufted
brows
made
a
strange
contrast
to
the
flaxen
or
chestnut
rustics
of
England,
and
the
newcomer
was
soon
known
as
"The
Black
Doctor
of
Bishop's
Crossing."
At
first
it
was
a
term
of
ridicule
and
reproach;
as
the
years
went
on
it
became
a
title
of
honour
which
was
familiar
to
the
whole
countryside,
and
extended
far
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
the
village.
For
the
newcomer
proved
himself
to
be
a
capable
surgeon
and
an
accomplished
physician.
The
practice
of
that
district
had
been
in
the
hands
of
Edward
Rowe,
the
son
of
Sir
William
Rowe,
the
Liverpool
consultant,
but
he
had
not
inherited
the
talents
of
his
father,
and
Dr.
Lana,
with
his
advantages
of
presence
and
of
manner,
soon
beat
him
out
of
the
field.
Dr.
Lana's
social
success
was
as
rapid
as
his
professional.
A
remarkable
surgical
cure
in
the
case
of
the
Hon.
James
Lowry,
the
second
son
of
Lord
Belton,
was
the
means
of
introducing
him
to
county
society,
where
he
became
a
favourite
through
the
charm
of
his
conversation
and
the
elegance
of
his
manners.
An
absence
of
antecedents
and
of
relatives
is
sometimes
an
aid
rather
than
an
impediment
to
social
advancement,
and
the
distinguished
individuality
of
the
handsome
doctor
was
its
own
recommendation.
His
patients
had
one
fault
and
one
fault
only
to
find
with
him.
He
appeared
to
be
a
confirmed
bachelor.
This
was
the
more
remarkable
since
the
house
which
he
occupied
was
a
large
one,
and
it
was
known
that
his
success
in
practice
had
enabled
him
to
save
considerable
sums.
At
first
the
local
matchmakers
were
continually
coupling
his
name
with
one
or
other
of
the
eligible
ladies,
but
as
years
passed
and
Dr.
Lana
remained
unmarried,
it
came
to
be
generally
understood
that
for
some
reason
he
must
remain
a
bachelor.
Some
even
went
so
far
as
to
assert
that
he
was
already
married,
and
that
it
was
in
order
to
escape
the
consequence
of
an
early
misalliance
that
he
had
buried
himself
