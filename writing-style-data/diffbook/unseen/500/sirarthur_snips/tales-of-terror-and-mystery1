The
Horror
of
the
Heights
The
idea
that
the
extraordinary
narrative
which
has
been
called
the
Joyce
Armstrong
Fragment
is
an
elaborate
practical
joke
evolved
by
some
unknown
person,
cursed
by
a
perverted
and
sinister
sense
of
humour,
has
now
been
abandoned
by
all
who
have
examined
the
matter.
The
most
macabre
and
imaginative
of
plotters
would
hesitate
before
linking
his
morbid
fancies
with
the
unquestioned
and
tragic
facts
which
reinforce
the
statement.
Though
the
assertions
contained
in
it
are
amazing
and
even
monstrous,
it
is
none
the
less
forcing
itself
upon
the
general
intelligence
that
they
are
true,
and
that
we
must
readjust
our
ideas
to
the
new
situation.
This
world
of
ours
appears
to
be
separated
by
a
slight
and
precarious
margin
of
safety
from
a
most
singular
and
unexpected
danger.
I
will
endeavour
in
this
narrative,
which
reproduces
the
original
document
in
its
necessarily
somewhat
fragmentary
form,
to
lay
before
the
reader
the
whole
of
the
facts
up
to
date,
prefacing
my
statement
by
saying
that,
if
there
be
any
who
doubt
the
narrative
of
Joyce
Armstrong,
there
can
be
no
question
at
all
as
to
the
facts
concerning
Lieutenant
Myrtle,
R.
N.,
and
Mr.
Hay
Connor,
who
undoubtedly
met
their
end
in
the
manner
described.
The
Joyce
Armstrong
Fragment
was
found
in
the
field
which
is
called
Lower
Haycock,
lying
one
mile
to
the
westward
of
the
village
of
Withyham,
upon
the
Kent
and
Sussex
border.
It
was
on
the
15th
September
last
that
an
agricultural
labourer,
James
Flynn,
in
the
employment
of
Mathew
Dodd,
farmer,
of
the
Chauntry
Farm,
Withyham,
perceived
a
briar
pipe
lying
near
the
footpath
which
skirts
the
hedge
in
Lower
Haycock.
A
few
paces
farther
on
he
picked
up
a
pair
of
broken
binocular
glasses.
Finally,
among
some
nettles
in
the
ditch,
he
caught
sight
of
a
flat,
canvas
backed
book,
which
proved
to
be
a
note
book
with
detachable
leaves,
some
of
which
had
come
loose
and
were
fluttering
along
the
base
of
the
hedge.
These
he
collected,
but
some,
including
the
first,
were
never
recovered,
and
leave
a
deplorable
hiatus
in
this
all
important
statement.
The
note
book
was
taken
by
the
labourer
to
his
master,
who
in
turn
showed
it
to
Dr.
J.
H.
Atherton,
of
Hartfield.
This
gentleman
at
once
recognized
the
need
for
an
expert
examination,
and
the
manuscript
was
forwarded
to
the
Aero
Club
in
London,
where
it
now
lies.
The
first
two
pages
of
the
manuscript
are
missing.
There
is
also
one
torn
away
at
the
end
of
the
narrative,
though
none
of
these
affect
the
general
coherence
of
the
story.
It
is
conjectured
that
the
missing
opening
is
concerned
with
the
record
of
Mr.
Joyce
Armstrong's
qualifications
as
an
aeronaut,
which
can
be
gathered
from
other
sources
and
are
admitted
to
be
unsurpassed
among
the
air
pilots
of
England.
For
many
years
he
has
been
looked
upon
as
among
the
most
daring
and
the
most
intellectual
of
flying
men,
a
combination
which
has
