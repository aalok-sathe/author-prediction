for
the
object
of
his
wrath
was
none
other
than
the
aged
charwoman
whom
I
have
already
mentioned
as
being
the
one
person
who
was
allowed
within
his
mysterious
chamber.
I
was
passing
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
turret
for
my
own
room
lay
in
that
direction
when
I
heard
a
sudden,
startled
scream,
and
merged
in
it
the
husky,
growling
note
of
a
man
who
is
inarticulate
with
passion.
It
was
the
snarl
of
a
furious
wild
beast.
Then
I
heard
his
voice
thrilling
with
anger.
"You
would
dare!"
he
cried.
"You
would
dare
to
disobey
my
directions!"
An
instant
later
the
charwoman
passed
me,
flying
down
the
passage,
white
faced
and
tremulous,
while
the
terrible
voice
thundered
behind
her.
"Go
to
Mrs.
Stevens
for
your
money!
Never
set
foot
in
Thorpe
Place
again!"
Consumed
with
curiosity,
I
could
not
help
following
the
woman,
and
found
her
round
the
corner
leaning
against
the
wall
and
palpitating
like
a
frightened
rabbit.
"What
is
the
matter,
Mrs.
Brown?"
I
asked.
"It's
master!"
she
gasped.
"Oh,
'ow
'e
frightened
me!
If
you
had
seen
'is
eyes,
Mr.
Colmore,
sir.
I
thought
'e
would
'ave
been
the
death
of
me."
"But
what
had
you
done?"
"Done,
sir!
Nothing.
At
least
nothing
to
make
so
much
of.
Just
laid
my
'and
on
that
black
box
of
'is
'adn't
even
opened
it,
when
in
'e
came
and
you
'eard
the
way
'e
went
on.
I've
lost
my
place,
and
glad
I
am
of
it,
for
I
would
never
trust
myself
within
reach
of
'im
again."
So
it
was
the
japanned
box
which
was
the
cause
of
this
outburst
the
box
from
which
he
would
never
permit
himself
to
be
separated.
What
was
the
connection,
or
was
there
any
connection
between
this
and
the
secret
visits
of
the
lady
whose
voice
I
had
overheard?
Sir
John
Bollamore's
wrath
was
enduring
as
well
as
fiery,
for
from
that
day
Mrs.
Brown,
the
charwoman,
vanished
from
our
ken,
and
Thorpe
Place
knew
her
no
more.
And
now
I
wish
to
tell
you
the
singular
chance
which
solved
all
these
strange
questions
and
put
my
employer's
secret
in
my
possession.
The
story
may
leave
you
with
some
lingering
doubts
as
to
whether
my
curiosity
did
not
get
the
better
of
my
honour,
and
whether
I
did
not
condescend
to
play
the
spy.
If
you
choose
to
think
so
I
cannot
help
it,
but
can
only
assure
you
that,
improbable
as
it
may
appear,
the
matter
came
about
exactly
as
I
describe
it.
The
first
stage
in
this
denouement
was
that
the
small
room
in
the
turret
became
uninhabitable.
This
occurred
through
the
fall
of
the
worm
eaten
oaken
beam
which
supported
the
ceiling.
Rotten
with
age,
it
snapped
in
the
middle
one
morning,
and
brought
down
a
quantity
of
plaster
with
it.
Fortunately
Sir
John
was
not
in
the
room
at
the
time.
His
precious
box
was
rescued
from
amongst
the
debris
and
brought
into
the
library,
where,
