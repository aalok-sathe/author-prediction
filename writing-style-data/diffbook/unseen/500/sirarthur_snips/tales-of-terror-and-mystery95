and
finally
went
early
to
bed.
And
then
it
was
that,
for
the
first
time,
the
suspicion
that
Lord
Linchmere
was
a
lunatic
crossed
my
mind.
He
followed
me
into
my
bedroom,
when
our
host
had
retired.
"Doctor,"
said
he,
speaking
in
a
low,
hurried
voice,
"you
must
come
with
me.
You
must
spend
the
night
in
my
bedroom."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"I
prefer
not
to
explain.
But
this
is
part
of
your
duties.
My
room
is
close
by,
and
you
can
return
to
your
own
before
the
servant
calls
you
in
the
morning."
"But
why?"
I
asked.
"Because
I
am
nervous
of
being
alone,"
said
he.
"That's
the
reason,
since
you
must
have
a
reason."
It
seemed
rank
lunacy,
but
the
argument
of
those
twenty
pounds
would
overcome
many
objections.
I
followed
him
to
his
room.
"Well,"
said
I,
"there's
only
room
for
one
in
that
bed."
"Only
one
shall
occupy
it,"
said
he.
"And
the
other?"
"Must
remain
on
watch."
"Why?"
said
I.
"One
would
think
you
expected
to
be
attacked."
"Perhaps
I
do."
"In
that
case,
why
not
lock
your
door?"
"Perhaps
I
WANT
to
be
attacked."
It
looked
more
and
more
like
lunacy.
However,
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit.
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
sat
down
in
the
arm
chair
beside
the
empty
fireplace.
"I
am
to
remain
on
watch,
then?"
said
I,
ruefully.
"We
will
divide
the
night.
If
you
will
watch
until
two,
I
will
watch
the
remainder."
"Very
good."
"Call
me
at
two
o'clock,
then."
"I
will
do
so."
"Keep
your
ears
open,
and
if
you
hear
any
sounds
wake
me
instantly
instantly,
you
hear?"
"You
can
rely
upon
it."
I
tried
to
look
as
solemn
as
he
did.
"And
for
God's
sake
don't
go
to
sleep,"
said
he,
and
so,
taking
off
only
his
coat,
he
threw
the
coverlet
over
him
and
settled
down
for
the
night.
It
was
a
melancholy
vigil,
and
made
more
so
by
my
own
sense
of
its
folly.
Supposing
that
by
any
chance
Lord
Linchmere
had
cause
to
suspect
that
he
was
subject
to
danger
in
the
house
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
why
on
earth
could
he
not
lock
his
door
and
so
protect
himself?
His
own
answer
that
he
might
wish
to
be
attacked
was
absurd.
Why
should
he
possibly
wish
to
be
attacked?
And
who
would
wish
to
attack
him?
Clearly,
Lord
Linchmere
was
suffering
from
some
singular
delusion,
and
the
result
was
that
on
an
imbecile
pretext
I
was
to
be
deprived
of
my
night's
rest.
Still,
however
absurd,
I
was
determined
to
carry
out
his
injunctions
to
the
letter
as
long
as
I
was
in
his
employment.
I
sat,
therefore,
beside
the
empty
fireplace,
and
listened
to
a
sonorous
chiming
clock
somewhere
down
the
passage
which
gurgled
and
struck
every
quarter
of
an
hour.
It
was
an
endless
vigil.
Save
for
that
single
clock,
an
absolute
silence
reigned
throughout
the
great
house.
A
small
lamp
stood
on
the
table
