that
of
a
pretty
woman.
There
was
the
piquant
difficulty
of
it
also,
for,
as
she
was
the
companion
of
Lady
Emily
Rood,
it
was
almost
impossible
to
see
her
alone.
On
the
top
of
all
the
other
obstacles
which
attracted
me,
I
learned
from
her
own
lips
very
early
in
the
proceedings
that
she
was
engaged."
"Mein
Gott!
To
whom?"
"She
mentioned
no
names."
"I
do
not
think
that
anyone
knows
that.
So
that
made
the
adventure
more
alluring,
did
it?"
"Well,
it
did
certainly
give
a
spice
to
it.
Don't
you
think
so?"
"I
tell
you
that
I
am
very
ignorant
about
these
things."
"My
dear
fellow,
you
can
remember
that
the
apple
you
stole
from
your
neighbour's
tree
was
always
sweeter
than
that
which
fell
from
your
own.
And
then
I
found
that
she
cared
for
me."
"What
at
once?"
"Oh,
no,
it
took
about
three
months
of
sapping
and
mining.
But
at
last
I
won
her
over.
She
understood
that
my
judicial
separation
from
my
wife
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
the
right
thing
by
her
but
she
came
all
the
same,
and
we
had
a
delightful
time,
as
long
as
it
lasted."
"But
how
about
the
other
man?"
Kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders.
"I
suppose
it
is
the
survival
of
the
fittest,"
said
he.
"If
he
had
been
the
better
man
she
would
not
have
deserted
him.
Let's
drop
the
subject,
for
I
have
had
enough
of
it!"
"Only
one
other
thing.
How
did
you
get
rid
of
her
in
three
weeks?"
"Well,
we
had
both
cooled
down
a
bit,
you
understand.
She
absolutely
refused,
under
any
circumstances,
to
come
back
to
face
the
people
she
had
known
in
Rome.
Now,
of
course,
Rome
is
necessary
to
me,
and
I
was
already
pining
to
be
back
at
my
work
so
there
was
one
obvious
cause
of
separation.
Then,
again,
her
old
father
turned
up
at
the
hotel
in
London,
and
there
was
a
scene,
and
the
whole
thing
became
so
unpleasant
that
really
though
I
missed
her
dreadfully
at
first
I
was
very
glad
to
slip
out
of
it.
Now,
I
rely
upon
you
not
to
repeat
anything
of
what
I
have
said."
"My
dear
Kennedy,
I
should
not
dream
of
repeating
it.
But
all
that
you
say
interests
me
very
much,
for
it
gives
me
an
insight
into
your
way
of
looking
at
things,
which
is
entirely
different
from
mine,
for
I
have
seen
so
little
of
life.
And
now
you
want
to
know
about
my
new
catacomb.
There's
no
use
my
trying
to
describe
it,
for
you
would
never
find
it
by
that.
There
is
only
one
thing,
and
that
is
for
me
to
take
you
there."
"That
would
be
splendid."
"When
would
you
like
to
come?"
"The
sooner
the
better.
I
am
all
impatience
to
see
it."
"Well,
it
is
a
beautiful
night
though
a
trifle
cold.
Suppose
we
start
in
an
hour.
We
must
be
very
careful
to
keep
the
