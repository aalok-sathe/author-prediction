at
all.
No
one
had
seen
him
come
and
no
one
would
miss
him.
We
were
both
clean
shaven,
and
his
hair
was
about
the
same
length
as
my
own.
If
I
changed
clothes
with
him,
then
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana
would
be
found
lying
dead
in
his
study,
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
an
unfortunate
fellow,
and
of
a
blighted
career.
There
was
plenty
of
ready
money
in
the
room,
and
this
I
could
carry
away
with
me
to
help
me
to
start
once
more
in
some
other
land.
In
my
brother's
clothes
I
could
walk
by
night
unobserved
as
far
as
Liverpool,
and
in
that
great
seaport
I
would
soon
find
some
means
of
leaving
the
country.
After
my
lost
hopes,
the
humblest
existence
where
I
was
unknown
was
far
preferable,
in
my
estimation,
to
a
practice,
however
successful,
in
Bishop's
Crossing,
where
at
any
moment
I
might
come
face
to
face
with
those
whom
I
should
wish,
if
it
were
possible,
to
forget.
I
determined
to
effect
the
change.
"And
I
did
so.
I
will
not
go
into
particulars,
for
the
recollection
is
as
painful
as
the
experience;
but
in
an
hour
my
brother
lay,
dressed
down
to
the
smallest
detail
in
my
clothes,
while
I
slunk
out
by
the
surgery
door,
and
taking
the
back
path
which
led
across
some
fields,
I
started
off
to
make
the
best
of
my
way
to
Liverpool,
where
I
arrived
the
same
night.
My
bag
of
money
and
a
certain
portrait
were
all
I
carried
out
of
the
house,
and
I
left
behind
me
in
my
hurry
the
shade
which
my
brother
had
been
wearing
over
his
eye.
Everything
else
of
his
I
took
with
me.
"I
give
you
my
word,
sir,
that
never
for
one
instant
did
the
idea
occur
to
me
that
people
might
think
that
I
had
been
murdered,
nor
did
I
imagine
that
anyone
might
be
caused
serious
danger
through
this
stratagem
by
which
I
endeavoured
to
gain
a
fresh
start
in
the
world.
On
the
contrary,
it
was
the
thought
of
relieving
others
from
the
burden
of
my
presence
which
was
always
uppermost
in
my
mind.
A
sailing
vessel
was
leaving
Liverpool
that
very
day
for
Corunna,
and
in
this
I
took
my
passage,
thinking
that
the
voyage
would
give
me
time
to
recover
my
balance,
and
to
consider
the
future.
But
before
I
left
my
resolution
softened.
I
bethought
me
that
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
I
would
not
cause
an
hour
of
sadness.
She
would
mourn
me
in
her
heart,
however
harsh
and
unsympathetic
her
relatives
might
be.
She
understood
and
appreciated
the
motives
upon
which
I
had
acted,
and
if
the
rest
of
her
family
condemned
me,
she,
at
least,
would
not
forget.
And
so
I
sent
her
a
note
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
to
save
her
from
a
baseless
grief.
If
under
the
pressure
of
events
she
broke
that
seal,
she
has
my
entire
sympathy
