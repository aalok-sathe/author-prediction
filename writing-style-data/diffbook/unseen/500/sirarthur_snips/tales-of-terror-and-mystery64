of
the
amount.
I'll
understand
it
when
I
see
it
in
black
and
white."
The
proposal
was
encouraging.
I
promised
to
do
so.
"And
now
it's
time
we
were
in
bed.
By
Jove,
there's
one
o'clock
striking
in
the
hall."
The
tingling
of
the
chiming
clock
broke
through
the
deep
roar
of
the
gale.
The
wind
was
sweeping
past
with
the
rush
of
a
great
river.
"I
must
see
my
cat
before
I
go
to
bed,"
said
my
host.
"A
high
wind
excites
him.
Will
you
come?"
"Certainly,"
said
I.
"Then
tread
softly
and
don't
speak,
for
everyone
is
asleep."
We
passed
quietly
down
the
lamp
lit
Persian
rugged
hall,
and
through
the
door
at
the
farther
end.
All
was
dark
in
the
stone
corridor,
but
a
stable
lantern
hung
on
a
hook,
and
my
host
took
it
down
and
lit
it.
There
was
no
grating
visible
in
the
passage,
so
I
knew
that
the
beast
was
in
its
cage.
"Come
in!"
said
my
relative,
and
opened
the
door.
A
deep
growling
as
we
entered
showed
that
the
storm
had
really
excited
the
creature.
In
the
flickering
light
of
the
lantern,
we
saw
it,
a
huge
black
mass
coiled
in
the
corner
of
its
den
and
throwing
a
squat,
uncouth
shadow
upon
the
whitewashed
wall.
Its
tail
switched
angrily
among
the
straw.
"Poor
Tommy
is
not
in
the
best
of
tempers,"
said
Everard
King,
holding
up
the
lantern
and
looking
in
at
him.
"What
a
black
devil
he
looks,
doesn't
he?
I
must
give
him
a
little
supper
to
put
him
in
a
better
humour.
Would
you
mind
holding
the
lantern
for
a
moment?"
I
took
it
from
his
hand
and
he
stepped
to
the
door.
"His
larder
is
just
outside
here,"
said
he.
"You
will
excuse
me
for
an
instant
won't
you?"
He
passed
out,
and
the
door
shut
with
a
sharp
metallic
click
behind
him.
That
hard
crisp
sound
made
my
heart
stand
still.
A
sudden
wave
of
terror
passed
over
me.
A
vague
perception
of
some
monstrous
treachery
turned
me
cold.
I
sprang
to
the
door,
but
there
was
no
handle
upon
the
inner
side.
"Here!"
I
cried.
"Let
me
out!"
"All
right!
Don't
make
a
row!"
said
my
host
from
the
passage.
"You've
got
the
light
all
right."
"Yes,
but
I
don't
care
about
being
locked
in
alone
like
this."
"Don't
you?"
I
heard
his
hearty,
chuckling
laugh.
"You
won't
be
alone
long."
"Let
me
out,
sir!"
I
repeated
angrily.
"I
tell
you
I
don't
allow
practical
jokes
of
this
sort."
"Practical
is
the
word,"
said
he,
with
another
hateful
chuckle.
And
then
suddenly
I
heard,
amidst
the
roar
of
the
storm,
the
creak
and
whine
of
the
winch
handle
turning
and
the
rattle
of
the
grating
as
it
passed
through
the
slot.
Great
God,
he
was
letting
loose
the
Brazilian
cat!
In
the
light
of
the
lantern
I
saw
the
bars
sliding
slowly
before
me.
Already
there
was
an
opening
a
foot
wide
at
the
