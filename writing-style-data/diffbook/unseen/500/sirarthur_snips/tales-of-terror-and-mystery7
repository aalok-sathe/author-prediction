Then
the
drift
swirled
inwards
again
and
the
great
solitude
was
unbroken.
"Just
after
ten
I
touched
the
lower
edge
of
the
upper
cloud
stratum.
It
consisted
of
fine
diaphanous
vapour
drifting
swiftly
from
the
westwards.
The
wind
had
been
steadily
rising
all
this
time
and
it
was
now
blowing
a
sharp
breeze
twenty
eight
an
hour
by
my
gauge.
Already
it
was
very
cold,
though
my
altimeter
only
marked
nine
thousand.
The
engines
were
working
beautifully,
and
we
went
droning
steadily
upwards.
The
cloud
bank
was
thicker
than
I
had
expected,
but
at
last
it
thinned
out
into
a
golden
mist
before
me,
and
then
in
an
instant
I
had
shot
out
from
it,
and
there
was
an
unclouded
sky
and
a
brilliant
sun
above
my
head
all
blue
and
gold
above,
all
shining
silver
below,
one
vast,
glimmering
plain
as
far
as
my
eyes
could
reach.
It
was
a
quarter
past
ten
o'clock,
and
the
barograph
needle
pointed
to
twelve
thousand
eight
hundred.
Up
I
went
and
up,
my
ears
concentrated
upon
the
deep
purring
of
my
motor,
my
eyes
busy
always
with
the
watch,
the
revolution
indicator,
the
petrol
lever,
and
the
oil
pump.
No
wonder
aviators
are
said
to
be
a
fearless
race.
With
so
many
things
to
think
of
there
is
no
time
to
trouble
about
oneself.
About
this
time
I
noted
how
unreliable
is
the
compass
when
above
a
certain
height
from
earth.
At
fifteen
thousand
feet
mine
was
pointing
east
and
a
point
south.
The
sun
and
the
wind
gave
me
my
true
bearings.
"I
had
hoped
to
reach
an
eternal
stillness
in
these
high
altitudes,
but
with
every
thousand
feet
of
ascent
the
gale
grew
stronger.
My
machine
groaned
and
trembled
in
every
joint
and
rivet
as
she
faced
it,
and
swept
away
like
a
sheet
of
paper
when
I
banked
her
on
the
turn,
skimming
down
wind
at
a
greater
pace,
perhaps,
than
ever
mortal
man
has
moved.
Yet
I
had
always
to
turn
again
and
tack
up
in
the
wind's
eye,
for
it
was
not
merely
a
height
record
that
I
was
after.
By
all
my
calculations
it
was
above
little
Wiltshire
that
my
air
jungle
lay,
and
all
my
labour
might
be
lost
if
I
struck
the
outer
layers
at
some
farther
point.
"When
I
reached
the
nineteen
thousand
foot
level,
which
was
about
midday,
the
wind
was
so
severe
that
I
looked
with
some
anxiety
to
the
stays
of
my
wings,
expecting
momentarily
to
see
them
snap
or
slacken.
I
even
cast
loose
the
parachute
behind
me,
and
fastened
its
hook
into
the
ring
of
my
leathern
belt,
so
as
to
be
ready
for
the
worst.
Now
was
the
time
when
a
bit
of
scamped
work
by
the
mechanic
is
paid
for
by
the
life
of
the
aeronaut.
But
she
held
together
bravely.
Every
cord
and
strut
was
humming
and
vibrating
like
so
many
harp
strings,
but
it
was
glorious
to
see
how,
for
all
the
beating
and
