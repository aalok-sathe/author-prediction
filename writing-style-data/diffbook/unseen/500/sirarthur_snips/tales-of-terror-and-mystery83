of
my
English
agent
who
is
a
man
with
a
considerable
future
before
him,
unless
some
complaint
of
the
throat
carries
him
off
before
his
time.
He
had
charge
of
all
arrangements
at
Liverpool,
whilst
I
was
stationed
at
the
inn
at
Kenyon,
where
I
awaited
a
cipher
signal
to
act.
When
the
special
was
arranged
for,
my
agent
instantly
telegraphed
to
me
and
warned
me
how
soon
I
should
have
everything
ready.
He
himself
under
the
name
of
Horace
Moore
applied
immediately
for
a
special
also,
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
sent
down
with
Monsieur
Caratal,
which
might
under
certain
circumstances
have
been
helpful
to
us.
If,
for
example,
our
great
coup
had
failed,
it
would
then
have
become
the
duty
of
my
agent
to
have
shot
them
both
and
destroyed
their
papers.
Caratal
was
on
his
guard,
however,
and
refused
to
admit
any
other
traveller.
My
agent
then
left
the
station,
returned
by
another
entrance,
entered
the
guard's
van
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
platform,
and
travelled
down
with
McPherson
the
guard.
"In
the
meantime
you
will
be
interested
to
know
what
my
movements
were.
Everything
had
been
prepared
for
days
before,
and
only
the
finishing
touches
were
needed.
The
side
line
which
we
had
chosen
had
once
joined
the
main
line,
but
it
had
been
disconnected.
We
had
only
to
replace
a
few
rails
to
connect
it
once
more.
These
rails
had
been
laid
down
as
far
as
could
be
done
without
danger
of
attracting
attention,
and
now
it
was
merely
a
case
of
completing
a
juncture
with
the
line,
and
arranging
the
points
as
they
had
been
before.
The
sleepers
had
never
been
removed,
and
the
rails,
fish
plates
and
rivets
were
all
ready,
for
we
had
taken
them
from
a
siding
on
the
abandoned
portion
of
the
line.
With
my
small
but
competent
band
of
workers,
we
had
everything
ready
long
before
the
special
arrived.
When
it
did
arrive,
it
ran
off
upon
the
small
side
line
so
easily
that
the
jolting
of
the
points
appears
to
have
been
entirely
unnoticed
by
the
two
travellers.
"Our
plan
had
been
that
Smith,
the
stoker,
should
chloroform
John
Slater,
the
driver,
so
that
he
should
vanish
with
the
others.
In
this
respect,
and
in
this
respect
only,
our
plans
miscarried
I
except
the
criminal
folly
of
McPherson
in
writing
home
to
his
wife.
Our
stoker
did
his
business
so
clumsily
that
Slater
in
his
struggles
fell
off
the
engine,
and
though
fortune
was
with
us
so
far
that
he
broke
his
neck
in
the
fall,
still
he
remained
as
a
blot
upon
that
which
would
otherwise
have
been
one
of
those
complete
masterpieces
which
are
only
to
be
contemplated
in
silent
admiration.
The
criminal
expert
will
find
in
John
Slater
the
one
flaw
in
all
our
admirable
combinations.
A
man
who
has
had
as
many
triumphs
as
I
can
afford
to
be
frank,
and
I
therefore
lay
my
finger
upon
John
Slater,
and
I
