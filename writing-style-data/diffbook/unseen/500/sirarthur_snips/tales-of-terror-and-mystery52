propped
up
in
bed,
six
weeks
after
my
last
entry
in
this
journal.
I
have
gone
through
a
terrible
shock
both
to
mind
and
body,
arising
from
such
an
experience
as
has
seldom
befallen
a
human
being
before.
But
I
have
attained
my
end.
The
danger
from
the
Terror
which
dwells
in
the
Blue
John
Gap
has
passed
never
to
return.
Thus
much
at
least
I,
a
broken
invalid,
have
done
for
the
common
good.
Let
me
now
recount
what
occurred
as
clearly
as
I
may.
The
night
of
Friday,
May
3rd,
was
dark
and
cloudy
the
very
night
for
the
monster
to
walk.
About
eleven
o'clock
I
went
from
the
farm
house
with
my
lantern
and
my
rifle,
having
first
left
a
note
upon
the
table
of
my
bedroom
in
which
I
said
that,
if
I
were
missing,
search
should
be
made
for
me
in
the
direction
of
the
Gap.
I
made
my
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
Roman
shaft,
and,
having
perched
myself
among
the
rocks
close
to
the
opening,
I
shut
off
my
lantern
and
waited
patiently
with
my
loaded
rifle
ready
to
my
hand.
It
was
a
melancholy
vigil.
All
down
the
winding
valley
I
could
see
the
scattered
lights
of
the
farm
houses,
and
the
church
clock
of
Chapel
le
Dale
tolling
the
hours
came
faintly
to
my
ears.
These
tokens
of
my
fellow
men
served
only
to
make
my
own
position
seem
the
more
lonely,
and
to
call
for
a
greater
effort
to
overcome
the
terror
which
tempted
me
continually
to
get
back
to
the
farm,
and
abandon
for
ever
this
dangerous
quest.
And
yet
there
lies
deep
in
every
man
a
rooted
self
respect
which
makes
it
hard
for
him
to
turn
back
from
that
which
he
has
once
undertaken.
This
feeling
of
personal
pride
was
my
salvation
now,
and
it
was
that
alone
which
held
me
fast
when
every
instinct
of
my
nature
was
dragging
me
away.
I
am
glad
now
that
I
had
the
strength.
In
spite
of
all
that
is
has
cost
me,
my
manhood
is
at
least
above
reproach.
Twelve
o'clock
struck
in
the
distant
church,
then
one,
then
two.
It
was
the
darkest
hour
of
the
night.
The
clouds
were
drifting
low,
and
there
was
not
a
star
in
the
sky.
An
owl
was
hooting
somewhere
among
the
rocks,
but
no
other
sound,
save
the
gentle
sough
of
the
wind,
came
to
my
ears.
And
then
suddenly
I
heard
it!
From
far
away
down
the
tunnel
came
those
muffled
steps,
so
soft
and
yet
so
ponderous.
I
heard
also
the
rattle
of
stones
as
they
gave
way
under
that
giant
tread.
They
drew
nearer.
They
were
close
upon
me.
I
heard
the
crashing
of
the
bushes
round
the
entrance,
and
then
dimly
through
the
darkness
I
was
conscious
of
the
loom
of
some
enormous
shape,
some
monstrous
inchoate
creature,
passing
swiftly
and
very
silently
out
from
the
tunnel.
I
was
paralysed
with
fear
and
amazement.
Long
as
