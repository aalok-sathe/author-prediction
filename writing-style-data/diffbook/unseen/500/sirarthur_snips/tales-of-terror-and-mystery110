everything
to
touch
his
heart,
but
all
to
no
purpose.
He
sat
there
with
a
fixed
sneer
upon
his
handsome
face,
while
every
now
and
then
Sparrow
MacCoy
would
throw
in
a
taunt
at
me,
or
some
word
of
encouragement
to
hold
my
brother
to
his
resolutions.
"'Why
don't
you
run
a
Sunday
school?'
he
would
say
to
me,
and
then,
in
the
same
breath:
'He
thinks
you
have
no
will
of
your
own.
He
thinks
you
are
just
the
baby
brother
and
that
he
can
lead
you
where
he
likes.
He's
only
just
finding
out
that
you
are
a
man
as
well
as
he.'
"It
was
those
words
of
his
which
set
me
talking
bitterly.
We
had
left
Willesden,
you
understand,
for
all
this
took
some
time.
My
temper
got
the
better
of
me,
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
let
my
brother
see
the
rough
side
of
me.
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
had
I
done
so
earlier
and
more
often.
"'A
man!'
said
I.
'Well,
I'm
glad
to
have
your
friend's
assurance
of
it,
for
no
one
would
suspect
it
to
see
you
like
a
boarding
school
missy.
I
don't
suppose
in
all
this
country
there
is
a
more
contemptible
looking
creature
than
you
are
as
you
sit
there
with
that
Dolly
pinafore
upon
you.'
He
coloured
up
at
that,
for
he
was
a
vain
man,
and
he
winced
from
ridicule.
"'It's
only
a
dust
cloak,'
said
he,
and
he
slipped
it
off.
'One
has
to
throw
the
coppers
off
one's
scent,
and
I
had
no
other
way
to
do
it.'
He
took
his
toque
off
with
the
veil
attached,
and
he
put
both
it
and
the
cloak
into
his
brown
bag.
'Anyway,
I
don't
need
to
wear
it
until
the
conductor
comes
round,'
said
he.
"'Nor
then,
either,'
said
I,
and
taking
the
bag
I
slung
it
with
all
my
force
out
of
the
window.
'Now,'
said
I,
'you'll
never
make
a
Mary
Jane
of
yourself
while
I
can
help
it.
If
nothing
but
that
disguise
stands
between
you
and
a
gaol,
then
to
gaol
you
shall
go.'
"That
was
the
way
to
manage
him.
I
felt
my
advantage
at
once.
His
supple
nature
was
one
which
yielded
to
roughness
far
more
readily
than
to
entreaty.
He
flushed
with
shame,
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears.
But
MacCoy
saw
my
advantage
also,
and
was
determined
that
I
should
not
pursue
it.
"'He's
my
pard,
and
you
shall
not
bully
him,'
he
cried.
"'He's
my
brother,
and
you
shall
not
ruin
him,'
said
I.
'I
believe
a
spell
of
prison
is
the
very
best
way
of
keeping
you
apart,
and
you
shall
have
it,
or
it
will
be
no
fault
of
mine.'
"'Oh,
you
would
squeal,
would
you?'
he
cried,
and
in
an
instant
he
whipped
out
his
revolver.
I
sprang
for
his
hand,
but
saw
that
I
was
too
late,
and
jumped
aside.
At
the
same
instant
he
fired,
and
the
bullet
