desperate,
which
would
put
a
few
honest
sovereigns
into
my
pocket.
The
man
fears
to
fail
who
has
to
pay
for
his
failure,
but
there
was
no
penalty
which
Fortune
could
exact
from
me.
I
was
like
the
gambler
with
empty
pockets,
who
is
still
allowed
to
try
his
luck
with
the
others.
No.
77B,
Brook
Street,
was
one
of
those
dingy
and
yet
imposing
houses,
dun
coloured
and
flat
faced,
with
the
intensely
respectable
and
solid
air
which
marks
the
Georgian
builder.
As
I
alighted
from
the
cab,
a
young
man
came
out
of
the
door
and
walked
swiftly
down
the
street.
In
passing
me,
I
noticed
that
he
cast
an
inquisitive
and
somewhat
malevolent
glance
at
me,
and
I
took
the
incident
as
a
good
omen,
for
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
rejected
candidate,
and
if
he
resented
my
application
it
meant
that
the
vacancy
was
not
yet
filled
up.
Full
of
hope,
I
ascended
the
broad
steps
and
rapped
with
the
heavy
knocker.
A
footman
in
powder
and
livery
opened
the
door.
Clearly
I
was
in
touch
with
the
people
of
wealth
and
fashion.
"Yes,
sir?"
said
the
footman.
"I
came
in
answer
to
"
"Quite
so,
sir,"
said
the
footman.
"Lord
Linchmere
will
see
you
at
once
in
the
library."
Lord
Linchmere!
I
had
vaguely
heard
the
name,
but
could
not
for
the
instant
recall
anything
about
him.
Following
the
footman,
I
was
shown
into
a
large,
book
lined
room
in
which
there
was
seated
behind
a
writing
desk
a
small
man
with
a
pleasant,
clean
shaven,
mobile
face,
and
long
hair
shot
with
grey,
brushed
back
from
his
forehead.
He
looked
me
up
and
down
with
a
very
shrewd,
penetrating
glance,
holding
the
card
which
the
footman
had
given
him
in
his
right
hand.
Then
he
smiled
pleasantly,
and
I
felt
that
externally
at
any
rate
I
possessed
the
qualifications
which
he
desired.
"You
have
come
in
answer
to
my
advertisement,
Dr.
Hamilton?"
he
asked.
"Yes,
sir."
"Do
you
fulfil
the
conditions
which
are
there
laid
down?"
"I
believe
that
I
do."
"You
are
a
powerful
man,
or
so
I
should
judge
from
your
appearance.
"I
think
that
I
am
fairly
strong."
"And
resolute?"
"I
believe
so."
"Have
you
ever
known
what
it
was
to
be
exposed
to
imminent
danger?"
"No,
I
don't
know
that
I
ever
have."
"But
you
think
you
would
be
prompt
and
cool
at
such
a
time?"
"I
hope
so."
"Well,
I
believe
that
you
would.
I
have
the
more
confidence
in
you
because
you
do
not
pretend
to
be
certain
as
to
what
you
would
do
in
a
position
that
was
new
to
you.
My
impression
is
that,
so
far
as
personal
qualities
go,
you
are
the
very
man
of
whom
I
am
in
search.
That
being
settled,
we
may
pass
on
to
the
next
point."
"Which
is?"
"To
talk
to
me
about
beetles."
I
looked
across
to
see
if
he
was
joking,
but,
on
the
contrary,
he
was
