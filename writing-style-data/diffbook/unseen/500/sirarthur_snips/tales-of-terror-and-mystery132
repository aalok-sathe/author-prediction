have
brought
them
to
an
end.
Mr.
Humphrey.
Can
you
explain
this,
Miss
Morton?
Miss
Morton:
Dr.
Lana
desired
his
secret
to
be
preserved.
Mr.
Porlock
Carr:
Then
why
have
you
made
this
public?
Miss
Morton:
To
save
my
brother.
A
murmur
of
sympathy
broke
out
in
court,
which
was
instantly
suppressed
by
the
Judge.
The
Judge:
Admitting
this
line
of
defence,
it
lies
with
you,
Mr.
Humphrey,
to
throw
a
light
upon
who
this
man
is
whose
body
has
been
recognized
by
so
many
friends
and
patients
of
Dr.
Lana
as
being
that
of
the
doctor
himself.
A
Juryman:
Has
anyone
up
to
now
expressed
any
doubt
about
the
matter?
Mr.
Porlock
Carr:
Not
to
my
knowledge.
Mr.
Humphrey:
We
hope
to
make
the
matter
clear.
The
Judge:
Then
the
court
adjourns
until
tomorrow.
This
new
development
of
the
case
excited
the
utmost
interest
among
the
general
public.
Press
comment
was
prevented
by
the
fact
that
the
trial
was
still
undecided,
but
the
question
was
everywhere
argued
as
to
how
far
there
could
be
truth
in
Miss
Morton's
declaration,
and
how
far
it
might
be
a
daring
ruse
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
brother.
The
obvious
dilemma
in
which
the
missing
doctor
stood
was
that
if
by
any
extraordinary
chance
he
was
not
dead,
then
he
must
be
held
responsible
for
the
death
of
this
unknown
man,
who
resembled
him
so
exactly,
and
who
was
found
in
his
study.
This
letter
which
Miss
Morton
refused
to
produce
was
possibly
a
confession
of
guilt,
and
she
might
find
herself
in
the
terrible
position
of
only
being
able
to
save
her
brother
from
the
gallows
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
former
lover.
The
court
next
morning
was
crammed
to
overflowing,
and
a
murmur
of
excitement
passed
over
it
when
Mr.
Humphrey
was
observed
to
enter
in
a
state
of
emotion,
which
even
his
trained
nerves
could
not
conceal,
and
to
confer
with
the
opposing
counsel.
A
few
hurried
words
words
which
left
a
look
of
amazement
upon
Mr.
Porlock
Carr's
face
passed
between
them,
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
defence,
addressing
the
Judge,
announced
that,
with
the
consent
of
the
prosecution,
the
young
lady
who
had
given
evidence
upon
the
sitting
before
would
not
be
recalled.
The
Judge:
But
you
appear,
Mr.
Humphrey,
to
have
left
matters
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
state.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Perhaps,
my
lord,
my
next
witness
may
help
to
clear
them
up.
The
Judge:
Then
call
your
next
witness.
Mr.
Humphrey:
I
call
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana.
The
learned
counsel
has
made
many
telling
remarks
in
his
day,
but
he
has
certainly
never
produced
such
a
sensation
with
so
short
a
sentence.
The
court
was
simply
stunned
with
amazement
as
the
very
man
whose
fate
had
been
the
subject
of
so
much
contention
appeared
bodily
before
them
in
the
witness
box.
Those
among
the
spectators
who
had
known
him
at
Bishop's
Crossing
saw
him
now,
gaunt
and
thin,
with
deep
lines
of
care
upon
his
face.
