time,
and
she
had
three
medical
students
and
one
engineer
as
lodgers.
I
occupied
the
top
room,
which
was
the
cheapest,
but
cheap
as
it
was
it
was
more
than
I
could
afford.
My
small
resources
were
dwindling
away,
and
every
week
it
became
more
necessary
that
I
should
find
something
to
do.
Yet
I
was
very
unwilling
to
go
into
general
practice,
for
my
tastes
were
all
in
the
direction
of
science,
and
especially
of
zoology,
towards
which
I
had
always
a
strong
leaning.
I
had
almost
given
the
fight
up
and
resigned
myself
to
being
a
medical
drudge
for
life,
when
the
turning
point
of
my
struggles
came
in
a
very
extraordinary
way.
One
morning
I
had
picked
up
the
Standard
and
was
glancing
over
its
contents.
There
was
a
complete
absence
of
news,
and
I
was
about
to
toss
the
paper
down
again,
when
my
eyes
were
caught
by
an
advertisement
at
the
head
of
the
personal
column.
It
was
worded
in
this
way:
"Wanted
for
one
or
more
days
the
services
of
a
medical
man.
It
is
essential
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
strong
physique,
of
steady
nerves,
and
of
a
resolute
nature.
Must
be
an
entomologist
coleopterist
preferred.
Apply,
in
person,
at
77B,
Brook
Street.
Application
must
be
made
before
twelve
o'clock
today."
Now,
I
have
already
said
that
I
was
devoted
to
zoology.
Of
all
branches
of
zoology,
the
study
of
insects
was
the
most
attractive
to
me,
and
of
all
insects
beetles
were
the
species
with
which
I
was
most
familiar.
Butterfly
collectors
are
numerous,
but
beetles
are
far
more
varied,
and
more
accessible
in
these
islands
than
are
butterflies.
It
was
this
fact
which
had
attracted
my
attention
to
them,
and
I
had
myself
made
a
collection
which
numbered
some
hundred
varieties.
As
to
the
other
requisites
of
the
advertisement,
I
knew
that
my
nerves
could
be
depended
upon,
and
I
had
won
the
weight
throwing
competition
at
the
inter
hospital
sports.
Clearly,
I
was
the
very
man
for
the
vacancy.
Within
five
minutes
of
my
having
read
the
advertisement
I
was
in
a
cab
and
on
my
was
to
Brook
Street.
As
I
drove,
I
kept
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
head
and
trying
to
make
a
guess
as
to
what
sort
of
employment
it
could
be
which
needed
such
curious
qualifications.
A
strong
physique,
a
resolute
nature,
a
medical
training,
and
a
knowledge
of
beetles
what
connection
could
there
be
between
these
various
requisites?
And
then
there
was
the
disheartening
fact
that
the
situation
was
not
a
permanent
one,
but
terminable
from
day
to
day,
according
to
the
terms
of
the
advertisement.
The
more
I
pondered
over
it
the
more
unintelligible
did
it
become;
but
at
the
end
of
my
meditations
I
always
came
back
to
the
ground
fact
that,
come
what
might,
I
had
nothing
to
lose,
that
I
was
completely
at
the
end
of
my
resources,
and
that
I
was
ready
for
any
adventure,
however
