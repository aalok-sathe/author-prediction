it
into
malignant
life
once
more.
But
at
least
I
was
able
to
think
clearly
now
that
the
baleful
eyes
were
off
me.
Here
I
was
shut
up
for
the
night
with
the
ferocious
beast.
My
own
instincts,
to
say
nothing
of
the
words
of
the
plausible
villain
who
laid
this
trap
for
me,
warned
me
that
the
animal
was
as
savage
as
its
master.
How
could
I
stave
it
off
until
morning?
The
door
was
hopeless,
and
so
were
the
narrow,
barred
windows.
There
was
no
shelter
anywhere
in
the
bare,
stone
flagged
room.
To
cry
for
assistance
was
absurd.
I
knew
that
this
den
was
an
outhouse,
and
that
the
corridor
which
connected
it
with
the
house
was
at
least
a
hundred
feet
long.
Besides,
with
the
gale
thundering
outside,
my
cries
were
not
likely
to
be
heard.
I
had
only
my
own
courage
and
my
own
wits
to
trust
to.
And
then,
with
a
fresh
wave
of
horror,
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
lantern.
The
candle
had
burned
low,
and
was
already
beginning
to
gutter.
In
ten
minutes
it
would
be
out.
I
had
only
ten
minutes
then
in
which
to
do
something,
for
I
felt
that
if
I
were
once
left
in
the
dark
with
that
fearful
beast
I
should
be
incapable
of
action.
The
very
thought
of
it
paralysed
me.
I
cast
my
despairing
eyes
round
this
chamber
of
death,
and
they
rested
upon
one
spot
which
seemed
to
promise
I
will
not
say
safety,
but
less
immediate
and
imminent
danger
than
the
open
floor.
I
have
said
that
the
cage
had
a
top
as
well
as
a
front,
and
this
top
was
left
standing
when
the
front
was
wound
through
the
slot
in
the
wall.
It
consisted
of
bars
at
a
few
inches'
interval,
with
stout
wire
netting
between,
and
it
rested
upon
a
strong
stanchion
at
each
end.
It
stood
now
as
a
great
barred
canopy
over
the
crouching
figure
in
the
corner.
The
space
between
this
iron
shelf
and
the
roof
may
have
been
from
two
or
three
feet.
If
I
could
only
get
up
there,
squeezed
in
between
bars
and
ceiling,
I
should
have
only
one
vulnerable
side.
I
should
be
safe
from
below,
from
behind,
and
from
each
side.
Only
on
the
open
face
of
it
could
I
be
attacked.
There,
it
is
true,
I
had
no
protection
whatever;
but
at
least,
I
should
be
out
of
the
brute's
path
when
he
began
to
pace
about
his
den.
He
would
have
to
come
out
of
his
way
to
reach
me.
It
was
now
or
never,
for
if
once
the
light
were
out
it
would
be
impossible.
With
a
gulp
in
my
throat
I
sprang
up,
seized
the
iron
edge
of
the
top,
and
swung
myself
panting
on
to
it.
I
writhed
in
face
downwards,
and
found
myself
looking
straight
into
the
terrible
eyes
and
yawning
jaws
of
the
cat.
Its
fetid
breath
came
up
into
my
face
like
the
steam
