woman.
It
was
low
so
low
that
it
was
only
in
that
still
night
air
that
we
could
have
heard
it,
but,
hushed
as
it
was,
there
was
no
mistaking
its
feminine
timbre.
It
spoke
hurriedly,
gaspingly
for
a
few
sentences,
and
then
was
silent
a
piteous,
breathless,
imploring
sort
of
voice.
Miss
Witherton
and
I
stood
for
an
instant
staring
at
each
other.
Then
we
walked
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
door.
"It
came
through
the
window,"
I
said.
"We
must
not
play
the
part
of
eavesdroppers,"
she
answered.
"We
must
forget
that
we
have
ever
heard
it."
There
was
an
absence
of
surprise
in
her
manner
which
suggested
a
new
idea
to
me.
"You
have
heard
it
before,"
I
cried.
"I
could
not
help
it.
My
own
room
is
higher
up
on
the
same
turret.
It
has
happened
frequently."
"Who
can
the
woman
be?"
"I
have
no
idea.
I
had
rather
not
discuss
it."
Her
voice
was
enough
to
show
me
what
she
thought.
But
granting
that
our
employer
led
a
double
and
dubious
life,
who
could
she
be,
this
mysterious
woman
who
kept
him
company
in
the
old
tower?
I
knew
from
my
own
inspection
how
bleak
and
bare
a
room
it
was.
She
certainly
did
not
live
there.
But
in
that
case
where
did
she
come
from?
It
could
not
be
anyone
of
the
household.
They
were
all
under
the
vigilant
eyes
of
Mrs.
Stevens.
The
visitor
must
come
from
without.
But
how?
And
then
suddenly
I
remembered
how
ancient
this
building
was,
and
how
probable
that
some
mediaeval
passage
existed
in
it.
There
is
hardly
an
old
castle
without
one.
The
mysterious
room
was
the
basement
of
the
turret,
so
that
if
there
were
anything
of
the
sort
it
would
open
through
the
floor.
There
were
numerous
cottages
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
The
other
end
of
the
secret
passage
might
lie
among
some
tangle
of
bramble
in
the
neighbouring
copse.
I
said
nothing
to
anyone,
but
I
felt
that
the
secret
of
my
employer
lay
within
my
power.
And
the
more
convinced
I
was
of
this
the
more
I
marvelled
at
the
manner
in
which
he
concealed
his
true
nature.
Often
as
I
watched
his
austere
figure,
I
asked
myself
if
it
were
indeed
possible
that
such
a
man
should
be
living
this
double
life,
and
I
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
my
suspicions
might
after
all
prove
to
be
ill
founded.
But
there
was
the
female
voice,
there
was
the
secret
nightly
rendezvous
in
the
turret
chamber
how
could
such
facts
admit
of
an
innocent
interpretation.
I
conceived
a
horror
of
the
man.
I
was
filled
with
loathing
at
his
deep,
consistent
hypocrisy.
Only
once
during
all
those
months
did
I
ever
see
him
without
that
sad
but
impassive
mask
which
he
usually
presented
towards
his
fellow
man.
For
an
instant
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
those
volcanic
fires
which
he
had
damped
down
so
long.
The
occasion
was
an
unworthy
one,
