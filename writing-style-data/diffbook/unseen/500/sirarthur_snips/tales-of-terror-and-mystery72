creditors;
but
it
was
Summers,
my
lawyer,
who
first
took
advantage
of
it.
"I
am
very
glad
to
see
that
your
lordship
is
so
much
better,"
said
he.
"I
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
offer
my
congratulations."
"What
do
you
mean,
Summers?
This
is
no
time
for
joking."
"I
mean
what
I
say,"
he
answered.
"You
have
been
Lord
Southerton
for
the
last
six
weeks,
but
we
feared
that
it
would
retard
your
recovery
if
you
were
to
learn
it."
Lord
Southerton!
One
of
the
richest
peers
in
England!
I
could
not
believe
my
ears.
And
then
suddenly
I
thought
of
the
time
which
had
elapsed,
and
how
it
coincided
with
my
injuries.
"Then
Lord
Southerton
must
have
died
about
the
same
time
that
I
was
hurt?"
"His
death
occurred
upon
that
very
day."
Summers
looked
hard
at
me
as
I
spoke,
and
I
am
convinced
for
he
was
a
very
shrewd
fellow
that
he
had
guessed
the
true
state
of
the
case.
He
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
awaiting
a
confidence
from
me,
but
I
could
not
see
what
was
to
be
gained
by
exposing
such
a
family
scandal.
"Yes,
a
very
curious
coincidence,"
he
continued,
with
the
same
knowing
look.
"Of
course,
you
are
aware
that
your
cousin
Everard
King
was
the
next
heir
to
the
estates.
Now,
if
it
had
been
you
instead
of
him
who
had
been
torn
to
pieces
by
this
tiger,
or
whatever
it
was,
then
of
course
he
would
have
been
Lord
Southerton
at
the
present
moment."
"No
doubt,"
said
I.
"And
he
took
such
an
interest
in
it,"
said
Summers.
"I
happen
to
know
that
the
late
Lord
Southerton's
valet
was
in
his
pay,
and
that
he
used
to
have
telegrams
from
him
every
few
hours
to
tell
him
how
he
was
getting
on.
That
would
be
about
the
time
when
you
were
down
there.
Was
it
not
strange
that
he
should
wish
to
be
so
well
informed,
since
he
knew
that
he
was
not
the
direct
heir?"
"Very
strange,"
said
I.
"And
now,
Summers,
if
you
will
bring
me
my
bills
and
a
new
cheque
book,
we
will
begin
to
get
things
into
order."
Tales
of
Mystery
The
Lost
Special
The
confession
of
Herbert
de
Lernac,
now
lying
under
sentence
of
death
at
Marseilles,
has
thrown
a
light
upon
one
of
the
most
inexplicable
crimes
of
the
century
an
incident
which
is,
I
believe,
absolutely
unprecedented
in
the
criminal
annals
of
any
country:
Although
there
is
a
reluctance
to
discuss
the
matter
in
official
circles,
and
little
information
has
been
given
to
the
Press,
there
are
still
indications
that
the
statement
of
this
arch
criminal
is
corroborated
by
the
facts,
and
that
we
have
at
last
found
a
solution
for
a
most
astounding
business.
As
the
matter
is
eight
years
old,
and
as
its
importance
was
somewhat
obscured
by
a
political
crisis
which
was
engaging
the
public
attention
at
the
time,
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
