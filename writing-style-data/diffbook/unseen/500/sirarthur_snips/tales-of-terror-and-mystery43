ranks
himself,
and
I
believe
that
in
his
youth
he
was
not
above
scaring
crows
in
these
very
fields.
It
is
a
most
lonely
spot,
and
the
walks
are
picturesque
in
the
extreme.
The
farm
consists
of
grazing
land
lying
at
the
bottom
of
an
irregular
valley.
On
each
side
are
the
fantastic
limestone
hills,
formed
of
rock
so
soft
that
you
can
break
it
away
with
your
hands.
All
this
country
is
hollow.
Could
you
strike
it
with
some
gigantic
hammer
it
would
boom
like
a
drum,
or
possibly
cave
in
altogether
and
expose
some
huge
subterranean
sea.
A
great
sea
there
must
surely
be,
for
on
all
sides
the
streams
run
into
the
mountain
itself,
never
to
reappear.
There
are
gaps
everywhere
amid
the
rocks,
and
when
you
pass
through
them
you
find
yourself
in
great
caverns,
which
wind
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth.
I
have
a
small
bicycle
lamp,
and
it
is
a
perpetual
joy
to
me
to
carry
it
into
these
weird
solitudes,
and
to
see
the
wonderful
silver
and
black
effect
when
I
throw
its
light
upon
the
stalactites
which
drape
the
lofty
roofs.
Shut
off
the
lamp,
and
you
are
in
the
blackest
darkness.
Turn
it
on,
and
it
is
a
scene
from
the
Arabian
Nights.
But
there
is
one
of
these
strange
openings
in
the
earth
which
has
a
special
interest,
for
it
is
the
handiwork,
not
of
nature,
but
of
man.
I
had
never
heard
of
Blue
John
when
I
came
to
these
parts.
It
is
the
name
given
to
a
peculiar
mineral
of
a
beautiful
purple
shade,
which
is
only
found
at
one
or
two
places
in
the
world.
It
is
so
rare
that
an
ordinary
vase
of
Blue
John
would
be
valued
at
a
great
price.
The
Romans,
with
that
extraordinary
instinct
of
theirs,
discovered
that
it
was
to
be
found
in
this
valley,
and
sank
a
horizontal
shaft
deep
into
the
mountain
side.
The
opening
of
their
mine
has
been
called
Blue
John
Gap,
a
clean
cut
arch
in
the
rock,
the
mouth
all
overgrown
with
bushes.
It
is
a
goodly
passage
which
the
Roman
miners
have
cut,
and
it
intersects
some
of
the
great
water
worn
caves,
so
that
if
you
enter
Blue
John
Gap
you
would
do
well
to
mark
your
steps
and
to
have
a
good
store
of
candles,
or
you
may
never
make
your
way
back
to
the
daylight
again.
I
have
not
yet
gone
deeply
into
it,
but
this
very
day
I
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
arched
tunnel,
and
peering
down
into
the
black
recesses
beyond,
I
vowed
that
when
my
health
returned
I
would
devote
some
holiday
to
exploring
those
mysterious
depths
and
finding
out
for
myself
how
far
the
Roman
had
penetrated
into
the
Derbyshire
hills.
Strange
how
superstitious
these
countrymen
are!
I
should
have
thought
better
of
young
Armitage,
for
he
is
a
man
of
some
education
and
character,
and
a
very
fine
fellow
for
his
station
