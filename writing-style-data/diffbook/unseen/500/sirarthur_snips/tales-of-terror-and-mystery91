thicker
and
heavier
the
better."
You
may
imagine
that
I
had
plenty
to
think
of
from
the
time
that
I
left
Brook
Street
until
I
set
out
to
meet
Lord
Linchmere
at
Paddington.
The
whole
fantastic
business
kept
arranging
and
rearranging
itself
in
kaleidoscopic
forms
inside
my
brain,
until
I
had
thought
out
a
dozen
explanations,
each
of
them
more
grotesquely
improbable
than
the
last.
And
yet
I
felt
that
the
truth
must
be
something
grotesquely
improbable
also.
At
last
I
gave
up
all
attempts
at
finding
a
solution,
and
contented
myself
with
exactly
carrying
out
the
instructions
which
I
had
received.
With
a
hand
valise,
specimen
case,
and
a
loaded
cane,
I
was
waiting
at
the
Paddington
bookstall
when
Lord
Linchmere
arrived.
He
was
an
even
smaller
man
than
I
had
thought
frail
and
peaky,
with
a
manner
which
was
more
nervous
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning.
He
wore
a
long,
thick
travelling
ulster,
and
I
observed
that
he
carried
a
heavy
blackthorn
cudgel
in
his
hand.
"I
have
the
tickets,"
said
he,
leading
the
way
up
the
platform.
"This
is
our
train.
I
have
engaged
a
carriage,
for
I
am
particularly
anxious
to
impress
one
or
two
things
upon
you
while
we
travel
down."
And
yet
all
that
he
had
to
impress
upon
me
might
have
been
said
in
a
sentence,
for
it
was
that
I
was
to
remember
that
I
was
there
as
a
protection
to
himself,
and
that
I
was
not
on
any
consideration
to
leave
him
for
an
instant.
This
he
repeated
again
and
again
as
our
journey
drew
to
a
close,
with
an
insistence
which
showed
that
his
nerves
were
thoroughly
shaken.
"Yes,"
he
said
at
last,
in
answer
to
my
looks
rather
than
to
my
words,
"I
AM
nervous,
Dr.
Hamilton.
I
have
always
been
a
timid
man,
and
my
timidity
depends
upon
my
frail
physical
health.
But
my
soul
is
firm,
and
I
can
bring
myself
up
to
face
a
danger
which
a
less
nervous
man
might
shrink
from.
What
I
am
doing
now
is
done
from
no
compulsion,
but
entirely
from
a
sense
of
duty,
and
yet
it
is,
beyond
doubt,
a
desperate
risk.
If
things
should
go
wrong,
I
will
have
some
claims
to
the
title
of
martyr."
This
eternal
reading
of
riddles
was
too
much
for
me.
I
felt
that
I
must
put
a
term
to
it.
"I
think
it
would
very
much
better,
sir,
if
you
were
to
trust
me
entirely,"
said
I.
"It
is
impossible
for
me
to
act
effectively,
when
I
do
not
know
what
are
the
objects
which
we
have
in
view,
or
even
where
we
are
going."
"Oh,
as
to
where
we
are
going,
there
need
be
no
mystery
about
that,"
said
he;
"we
are
going
to
Delamere
Court,
the
residence
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
with
whose
work
you
are
so
conversant.
As
to
the
exact
object
of
our
visit,
I
do
not
know
that
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
anything
