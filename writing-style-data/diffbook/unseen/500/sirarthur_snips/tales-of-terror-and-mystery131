not
feel
that
she
had
any
grievance
whatever
against
Dr.
Lana,
and
that
in
her
opinion
he
had
acted
in
a
perfectly
honourable
manner.
Her
brother,
on
an
insufficient
knowledge
of
the
facts,
had
taken
another
view,
and
she
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that,
in
spite
of
her
entreaties,
he
had
uttered
threats
of
personal
violence
against
the
doctor,
and
had,
upon
the
evening
of
the
tragedy,
announced
his
intention
of
"having
it
out
with
him."
She
had
done
her
best
to
bring
him
to
a
more
reasonable
frame
of
mind,
but
he
was
very
headstrong
where
his
emotions
or
prejudices
were
concerned.
Up
to
this
point
the
young
lady's
evidence
had
appeared
to
make
against
the
prisoner
rather
than
in
his
favour.
The
questions
of
her
counsel,
however,
soon
put
a
very
different
light
upon
the
matter,
and
disclosed
an
unexpected
line
of
defence.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Do
you
believe
your
brother
to
be
guilty
of
this
crime?
The
Judge:
I
cannot
permit
that
question,
Mr.
Humphrey.
We
are
here
to
decide
upon
questions
of
fact
not
of
belief.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Do
you
know
that
your
brother
is
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
Doctor
Lana?
Miss
Morton:
Yes.
Mr.
Humphrey:
How
do
you
know
it?
Miss
Morton:
Because
Dr.
Lana
is
not
dead.
There
followed
a
prolonged
sensation
in
court,
which
interrupted
the
examination
of
the
witness.
Mr.
Humphrey:
And
how
do
you
know,
Miss
Morton,
that
Dr.
Lana
is
not
dead?
Miss
Morton:
Because
I
have
received
a
letter
from
him
since
the
date
of
his
supposed
death.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Have
you
this
letter?
Miss
Morton:
Yes,
but
I
should
prefer
not
to
show
it.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Have
you
the
envelope?
Miss
Morton:
Yes,
it
is
here.
Mr.
Humphrey:
What
is
the
post
mark?
Miss
Morton:
Liverpool.
Mr.
Humphrey:
And
the
date?
Miss
Morton:
June
the
22nd.
Mr.
Humphrey:
That
being
the
day
after
his
alleged
death.
Are
you
prepared
to
swear
to
this
handwriting,
Miss
Morton?
Miss
Morton:
Certainly.
Mr.
Humphrey:
I
am
prepared
to
call
six
other
witnesses,
my
lord,
to
testify
that
this
letter
is
in
the
writing
of
Doctor
Lana.
The
Judge:
Then
you
must
call
them
tomorrow.
Mr.
Porlock
Carr
(counsel
for
the
prosecution):
In
the
meantime,
my
lord,
we
claim
possession
of
this
document,
so
that
we
may
obtain
expert
evidence
as
to
how
far
it
is
an
imitation
of
the
handwriting
of
the
gentleman
whom
we
still
confidently
assert
to
be
deceased.
I
need
not
point
out
that
the
theory
so
unexpectedly
sprung
upon
us
may
prove
to
be
a
very
obvious
device
adopted
by
the
friends
of
the
prisoner
in
order
to
divert
this
inquiry.
I
would
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
young
lady
must,
according
to
her
own
account,
have
possessed
this
letter
during
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
and
at
the
police
court.
She
desires
us
to
believe
that
she
permitted
these
to
proceed,
although
she
held
in
her
pocket
evidence
which
would
at
any
moment
