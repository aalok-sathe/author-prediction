his
wife,
from
which
she
escaped
with
injuries
that
you
may
have
observed
when
you
met
her
in
London.
You
understand
that
he
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
when
he
is
in
his
sound
senses,
and
would
ridicule
the
suggestion
that
he
could
under
any
circumstances
injure
those
whom
he
loves
so
dearly.
It
is
often,
as
you
know,
a
characteristic
of
such
maladies
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
convince
the
man
who
suffers
from
them
of
their
existence.
"Our
great
object
was,
of
course,
to
get
him
under
restraint
before
he
could
stain
his
hands
with
blood,
but
the
matter
was
full
of
difficulty.
He
is
a
recluse
in
his
habits,
and
would
not
see
any
medical
man.
Besides,
it
was
necessary
for
our
purpose
that
the
medical
man
should
convince
himself
of
his
insanity;
and
he
is
sane
as
you
or
I,
save
on
these
very
rare
occasions.
But,
fortunately,
before
he
has
these
attacks
he
always
shows
certain
premonitory
symptoms,
which
are
providential
danger
signals,
warning
us
to
be
upon
our
guard.
The
chief
of
these
is
that
nervous
contortion
of
the
forehead
which
you
must
have
observed.
This
is
a
phenomenon
which
always
appears
from
three
to
four
days
before
his
attacks
of
frenzy.
The
moment
it
showed
itself
his
wife
came
into
town
on
some
pretext,
and
took
refuge
in
my
house
in
Brook
Street.
"It
remained
for
me
to
convince
a
medical
man
of
Sir
Thomas's
insanity,
without
which
it
was
impossible
to
put
him
where
he
could
do
no
harm.
The
first
problem
was
how
to
get
a
medical
man
into
his
house.
I
bethought
me
of
his
interest
in
beetles,
and
his
love
for
anyone
who
shared
his
tastes.
I
advertised,
therefore,
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
in
you
the
very
man
I
wanted.
A
stout
companion
was
necessary,
for
I
knew
that
the
lunacy
could
only
be
proved
by
a
murderous
assault,
and
I
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
that
assault
would
be
made
upon
myself,
since
he
had
the
warmest
regard
for
me
in
his
moments
of
sanity.
I
think
your
intelligence
will
supply
all
the
rest.
I
did
not
know
that
the
attack
would
come
by
night,
but
I
thought
it
very
probable,
for
the
crises
of
such
cases
usually
do
occur
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning.
I
am
a
very
nervous
man
myself,
but
I
saw
no
other
way
in
which
I
could
remove
this
terrible
danger
from
my
sister's
life.
I
need
not
ask
you
whether
you
are
willing
to
sign
the
lunacy
papers."
"Undoubtedly.
But
TWO
signatures
are
necessary."
"You
forget
that
I
am
myself
a
holder
of
a
medical
degree.
I
have
the
papers
on
a
side
table
here,
so
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
sign
them
now,
we
can
have
the
patient
removed
in
the
morning."
So
that
was
my
visit
to
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
the
famous
beetle
hunter,
and
that
was
also
my
first
step
upon
