his
actual
engagement
to
Elise,
there
was
hardly
an
evening
which
he
did
not
pass
with
us,
and
an
hour
or
two
were
generally
devoted
to
the
museum.
He
had
the
free
run
of
the
place,
and
when
I
have
been
away
for
the
evening
I
had
no
objection
to
his
doing
whatever
he
wished
here.
This
state
of
things
was
only
terminated
by
the
fact
of
my
resignation
of
my
official
duties
and
my
retirement
to
Norwood,
where
I
hoped
to
have
the
leisure
to
write
a
considerable
work
which
I
had
planned.
"It
was
immediately
after
this
within
a
week
or
so
that
I
first
realized
the
true
nature
and
character
of
the
man
whom
I
had
so
imprudently
introduced
into
my
family.
The
discovery
came
to
me
through
letters
from
my
friends
abroad,
which
showed
me
that
his
introductions
to
me
had
been
forgeries.
Aghast
at
the
revelation,
I
asked
myself
what
motive
this
man
could
originally
have
had
in
practising
this
elaborate
deception
upon
me.
I
was
too
poor
a
man
for
any
fortune
hunter
to
have
marked
me
down.
Why,
then,
had
he
come?
I
remembered
that
some
of
the
most
precious
gems
in
Europe
had
been
under
my
charge,
and
I
remembered
also
the
ingenious
excuses
by
which
this
man
had
made
himself
familiar
with
the
cases
in
which
they
were
kept.
He
was
a
rascal
who
was
planning
some
gigantic
robbery.
How
could
I,
without
striking
my
own
daughter,
who
was
infatuated
about
him,
prevent
him
from
carrying
out
any
plan
which
he
might
have
formed?
My
device
was
a
clumsy
one,
and
yet
I
could
think
of
nothing
more
effective.
If
I
had
written
a
letter
under
my
own
name,
you
would
naturally
have
turned
to
me
for
details
which
I
did
not
wish
to
give.
I
resorted
to
an
anonymous
letter,
begging
you
to
be
upon
your
guard.
"I
may
tell
you
that
my
change
from
Belmore
Street
to
Norwood
had
not
affected
the
visits
of
this
man,
who
had,
I
believe,
a
real
and
overpowering
affection
for
my
daughter.
As
to
her,
I
could
not
have
believed
that
any
woman
could
be
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
a
man
as
she
was.
His
stronger
nature
seemed
to
entirely
dominate
her.
I
had
not
realized
how
far
this
was
the
case,
or
the
extent
of
the
confidence
which
existed
between
them,
until
that
very
evening
when
his
true
character
for
the
first
time
was
made
clear
to
me.
I
had
given
orders
that
when
he
called
he
should
be
shown
into
my
study
instead
of
to
the
drawing
room.
There
I
told
him
bluntly
that
I
knew
all
about
him,
that
I
had
taken
steps
to
defeat
his
designs,
and
that
neither
I
nor
my
daughter
desired
ever
to
see
him
again.
I
added
that
I
thanked
God
that
I
had
found
him
out
before
he
had
time
to
harm
those
precious
objects
which
it
had
been
the
work
of
