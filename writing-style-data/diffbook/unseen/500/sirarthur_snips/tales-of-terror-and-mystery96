at
my
elbow,
throwing
a
circle
of
light
round
my
chair,
but
leaving
the
corners
of
the
room
draped
in
shadow.
On
the
bed
Lord
Linchmere
was
breathing
peacefully.
I
envied
him
his
quiet
sleep,
and
again
and
again
my
own
eyelids
drooped,
but
every
time
my
sense
of
duty
came
to
my
help,
and
I
sat
up,
rubbing
my
eyes
and
pinching
myself
with
a
determination
to
see
my
irrational
watch
to
an
end.
And
I
did
so.
From
down
the
passage
came
the
chimes
of
two
o'clock,
and
I
laid
my
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
sleeper.
Instantly
he
was
sitting
up,
with
an
expression
of
the
keenest
interest
upon
his
face.
"You
have
heard
something?"
"No,
sir.
It
is
two
o'clock."
"Very
good.
I
will
watch.
You
can
go
to
sleep."
I
lay
down
under
the
coverlet
as
he
had
done
and
was
soon
unconscious.
My
last
recollection
was
of
that
circle
of
lamplight,
and
of
the
small,
hunched
up
figure
and
strained,
anxious
face
of
Lord
Linchmere
in
the
centre
of
it.
How
long
I
slept
I
do
not
know;
but
I
was
suddenly
aroused
by
a
sharp
tug
at
my
sleeve.
The
room
was
in
darkness,
but
a
hot
smell
of
oil
told
me
that
the
lamp
had
only
that
instant
been
extinguished.
"Quick!
Quick!"
said
Lord
Linchmere's
voice
in
my
ear.
I
sprang
out
of
bed,
he
still
dragging
at
my
arm.
"Over
here!"
he
whispered,
and
pulled
me
into
a
corner
of
the
room.
"Hush!
Listen!"
In
the
silence
of
the
night
I
could
distinctly
hear
that
someone
was
coming
down
the
corridor.
It
was
a
stealthy
step,
faint
and
intermittent,
as
of
a
man
who
paused
cautiously
after
every
stride.
Sometimes
for
half
a
minute
there
was
no
sound,
and
then
came
the
shuffle
and
creak
which
told
of
a
fresh
advance.
My
companion
was
trembling
with
excitement.
His
hand,
which
still
held
my
sleeve,
twitched
like
a
branch
in
the
wind.
"What
is
it?"
I
whispered.
"It's
he!"
"Sir
Thomas?"
"Yes."
"What
does
he
want?"
"Hush!
Do
nothing
until
I
tell
you."
I
was
conscious
now
that
someone
was
trying
the
door.
There
was
the
faintest
little
rattle
from
the
handle,
and
then
I
dimly
saw
a
thin
slit
of
subdued
light.
There
was
a
lamp
burning
somewhere
far
down
the
passage,
and
it
just
sufficed
to
make
the
outside
visible
from
the
darkness
of
our
room.
The
greyish
slit
grew
broader
and
broader,
very
gradually,
very
gently,
and
then
outlined
against
it
I
saw
the
dark
figure
of
a
man.
He
was
squat
and
crouching,
with
the
silhouette
of
a
bulky
and
misshapen
dwarf.
Slowly
the
door
swung
open
with
this
ominous
shape
framed
in
the
centre
of
it.
And
then,
in
an
instant,
the
crouching
figure
shot
up,
there
was
a
tiger
spring
across
the
room
and
thud,
thud,
thud,
came
three
tremendous
blows
from
some
heavy
object
upon
the
bed.
I
was
so
paralysed
with
amazement
that
