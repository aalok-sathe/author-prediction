proclaim
him
to
be
a
flaw.
"But
now
I
have
got
our
special
train
upon
the
small
line
two
kilometres,
or
rather
more
than
one
mile,
in
length,
which
leads,
or
rather
used
to
lead,
to
the
abandoned
Heartsease
mine,
once
one
of
the
largest
coal
mines
in
England.
You
will
ask
how
it
is
that
no
one
saw
the
train
upon
this
unused
line.
I
answer
that
along
its
entire
length
it
runs
through
a
deep
cutting,
and
that,
unless
someone
had
been
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting,
he
could
not
have
seen
it.
There
WAS
someone
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting.
I
was
there.
And
now
I
will
tell
you
what
I
saw.
"My
assistant
had
remained
at
the
points
in
order
that
he
might
superintend
the
switching
off
of
the
train.
He
had
four
armed
men
with
him,
so
that
if
the
train
ran
off
the
line
we
thought
it
probable,
because
the
points
were
very
rusty
we
might
still
have
resources
to
fall
back
upon.
Having
once
seen
it
safely
on
the
side
line,
he
handed
over
the
responsibility
to
me.
I
was
waiting
at
a
point
which
overlooks
the
mouth
of
the
mine,
and
I
was
also
armed,
as
were
my
two
companions.
Come
what
might,
you
see,
I
was
always
ready.
"The
moment
that
the
train
was
fairly
on
the
side
line,
Smith,
the
stoker,
slowed
down
the
engine,
and
then,
having
turned
it
on
to
the
fullest
speed
again,
he
and
McPherson,
with
my
English
lieutenant,
sprang
off
before
it
was
too
late.
It
may
be
that
it
was
this
slowing
down
which
first
attracted
the
attention
of
the
travellers,
but
the
train
was
running
at
full
speed
again
before
their
heads
appeared
at
the
open
window.
It
makes
me
smile
to
think
how
bewildered
they
must
have
been.
Picture
to
yourself
your
own
feelings
if,
on
looking
out
of
your
luxurious
carriage,
you
suddenly
perceived
that
the
lines
upon
which
you
ran
were
rusted
and
corroded,
red
and
yellow
with
disuse
and
decay!
What
a
catch
must
have
come
in
their
breath
as
in
a
second
it
flashed
upon
them
that
it
was
not
Manchester
but
Death
which
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
end
of
that
sinister
line.
But
the
train
was
running
with
frantic
speed,
rolling
and
rocking
over
the
rotten
line,
while
the
wheels
made
a
frightful
screaming
sound
upon
the
rusted
surface.
I
was
close
to
them,
and
could
see
their
faces.
Caratal
was
praying,
I
think
there
was
something
like
a
rosary
dangling
out
of
his
hand.
The
other
roared
like
a
bull
who
smells
the
blood
of
the
slaughter
house.
He
saw
us
standing
on
the
bank,
and
he
beckoned
to
us
like
a
madman.
Then
he
tore
at
his
wrist
and
threw
his
dispatch
box
out
of
the
window
in
our
direction.
Of
course,
his
meaning
was
obvious.
Here
was
the
evidence,
and
they
would
promise
to
be
silent
if
their
lives
were
