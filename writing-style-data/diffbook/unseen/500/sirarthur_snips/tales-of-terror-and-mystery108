that
he
had
left.
In
an
instant
I
had
resolved
to
go
also,
and
to
pit
my
influence
against
MacCoy's.
I
knew
it
was
a
losing
fight,
but
I
thought,
and
my
mother
thought,
that
it
was
my
duty.
We
passed
the
last
night
together
in
prayer
for
my
success,
and
she
gave
me
her
own
Testament
that
my
father
had
given
her
on
the
day
of
their
marriage
in
the
Old
Country,
so
that
I
might
always
wear
it
next
my
heart.
"I
was
a
fellow
traveller,
on
the
steamship,
with
Sparrow
MacCoy,
and
at
least
I
had
the
satisfaction
of
spoiling
his
little
game
for
the
voyage.
The
very
first
night
I
went
into
the
smoking
room,
and
found
him
at
the
head
of
a
card
table,
with
a
half
a
dozen
young
fellows
who
were
carrying
their
full
purses
and
their
empty
skulls
over
to
Europe.
He
was
settling
down
for
his
harvest,
and
a
rich
one
it
would
have
been.
But
I
soon
changed
all
that.
"'Gentlemen,'
said
I,
'are
you
aware
whom
you
are
playing
with?'
"'What's
that
to
you?
You
mind
your
own
business!'
said
he,
with
an
oath.
"'Who
is
it,
anyway?'
asked
one
of
the
dudes.
"'He's
Sparrow
MacCoy,
the
most
notorious
card
sharper
in
the
States.'
"Up
he
jumped
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand,
but
he
remembered
that
he
was
under
the
flag
of
the
effete
Old
Country,
where
law
and
order
run,
and
Tammany
has
no
pull.
Gaol
and
the
gallows
wait
for
violence
and
murder,
and
there's
no
slipping
out
by
the
back
door
on
board
an
ocean
liner.
"'Prove
your
words,
you
!'
said
he.
"'I
will!'
said
I.
'If
you
will
turn
up
your
right
shirt
sleeve
to
the
shoulder,
I
will
either
prove
my
words
or
I
will
eat
them.'
"He
turned
white
and
said
not
a
word.
You
see,
I
knew
something
of
his
ways,
and
I
was
aware
of
that
part
of
the
mechanism
which
he
and
all
such
sharpers
use
consists
of
an
elastic
down
the
arm
with
a
clip
just
above
the
wrist.
It
is
by
means
of
this
clip
that
they
withdraw
from
their
hands
the
cards
which
they
do
not
want,
while
they
substitute
other
cards
from
another
hiding
place.
I
reckoned
on
it
being
there,
and
it
was.
He
cursed
me,
slunk
out
of
the
saloon,
and
was
hardly
seen
again
during
the
voyage.
For
once,
at
any
rate,
I
got
level
with
Mister
Sparrow
MacCoy.
"But
he
soon
had
his
revenge
upon
me,
for
when
it
came
to
influencing
my
brother
he
outweighed
me
every
time.
Edward
had
kept
himself
straight
in
London
for
the
first
few
weeks,
and
had
done
some
business
with
his
American
watches,
until
this
villain
came
across
his
path
once
more.
I
did
my
best,
but
the
best
was
little
enough.
The
next
thing
I
heard
there
had
been
a
scandal
at
one
of
the
Northumberland
Avenue
hotels:
a
traveller
had
been
