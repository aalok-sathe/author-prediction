from
some
foul
pot.
It
appeared,
however,
to
be
rather
curious
than
angry.
With
a
sleek
ripple
of
its
long,
black
back
it
rose,
stretched
itself,
and
then
rearing
itself
on
its
hind
legs,
with
one
forepaw
against
the
wall,
it
raised
the
other,
and
drew
its
claws
across
the
wire
meshes
beneath
me.
One
sharp,
white
hook
tore
through
my
trousers
for
I
may
mention
that
I
was
still
in
evening
dress
and
dug
a
furrow
in
my
knee.
It
was
not
meant
as
an
attack,
but
rather
as
an
experiment,
for
upon
my
giving
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
he
dropped
down
again,
and
springing
lightly
into
the
room,
he
began
walking
swiftly
round
it,
looking
up
every
now
and
again
in
my
direction.
For
my
part
I
shuffled
backwards
until
I
lay
with
my
back
against
the
wall,
screwing
myself
into
the
smallest
space
possible.
The
farther
I
got
the
more
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
attack
me.
He
seemed
more
excited
now
that
he
had
begun
to
move
about,
and
he
ran
swiftly
and
noiselessly
round
and
round
the
den,
passing
continually
underneath
the
iron
couch
upon
which
I
lay.
It
was
wonderful
to
see
so
great
a
bulk
passing
like
a
shadow,
with
hardly
the
softest
thudding
of
velvety
pads.
The
candle
was
burning
low
so
low
that
I
could
hardly
see
the
creature.
And
then,
with
a
last
flare
and
splutter
it
went
out
altogether.
I
was
alone
with
the
cat
in
the
dark!
It
helps
one
to
face
a
danger
when
one
knows
that
one
has
done
all
that
possibly
can
be
done.
There
is
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
quietly
await
the
result.
In
this
case,
there
was
no
chance
of
safety
anywhere
except
the
precise
spot
where
I
was.
I
stretched
myself
out,
therefore,
and
lay
silently,
almost
breathlessly,
hoping
that
the
beast
might
forget
my
presence
if
I
did
nothing
to
remind
him.
I
reckoned
that
it
must
already
be
two
o'clock.
At
four
it
would
be
full
dawn.
I
had
not
more
than
two
hours
to
wait
for
daylight.
Outside,
the
storm
was
still
raging,
and
the
rain
lashed
continually
against
the
little
windows.
Inside,
the
poisonous
and
fetid
air
was
overpowering.
I
could
neither
hear
nor
see
the
cat.
I
tried
to
think
about
other
things
but
only
one
had
power
enough
to
draw
my
mind
from
my
terrible
position.
That
was
the
contemplation
of
my
cousin's
villainy,
his
unparalleled
hypocrisy,
his
malignant
hatred
of
me.
Beneath
that
cheerful
face
there
lurked
the
spirit
of
a
mediaeval
assassin.
And
as
I
thought
of
it
I
saw
more
clearly
how
cunningly
the
thing
had
been
arranged.
He
had
apparently
gone
to
bed
with
the
others.
No
doubt
he
had
his
witness
to
prove
it.
Then,
unknown
to
them,
he
had
slipped
down,
had
lured
me
into
his
den
and
abandoned
me.
His
story
would
be
so
simple.
He
had
left
me
to
finish
my
cigar
in
the
