police
could
identify
him
or
learn
how
he
had
got
there.
His
ticket
was
in
MacCoy's
pocket,
and
so
was
the
ticket
for
some
baggage
which
they
had
left
at
the
depot.
Like
most
Americans,
he
had
found
it
cheaper
and
easier
to
buy
an
outfit
in
London
than
to
bring
one
from
New
York,
so
that
all
his
linen
and
clothes
were
new
and
unmarked.
The
bag,
containing
the
dust
cloak,
which
I
had
thrown
out
of
the
window,
may
have
fallen
among
some
bramble
patch
where
it
is
still
concealed,
or
may
have
been
carried
off
by
some
tramp,
or
may
have
come
into
the
possession
of
the
police,
who
kept
the
incident
to
themselves.
Anyhow,
I
have
seen
nothing
about
it
in
the
London
papers.
As
to
the
watches,
they
were
a
selection
from
those
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
for
business
purposes.
It
may
have
been
for
the
same
business
purposes
that
he
was
taking
them
to
Manchester,
but
well,
it's
too
late
to
enter
into
that.
"I
don't
blame
the
police
for
being
at
fault.
I
don't
see
how
it
could
have
been
otherwise.
There
was
just
one
little
clue
that
they
might
have
followed
up,
but
it
was
a
small
one.
I
mean
that
small,
circular
mirror
which
was
found
in
my
brother's
pocket.
It
isn't
a
very
common
thing
for
a
young
man
to
carry
about
with
him,
is
it?
But
a
gambler
might
have
told
you
what
such
a
mirror
may
mean
to
a
card
sharper.
If
you
sit
back
a
little
from
the
table,
and
lay
the
mirror,
face
upwards,
upon
your
lap,
you
can
see,
as
you
deal,
every
card
that
you
give
to
your
adversary.
It
is
not
hard
to
say
whether
you
see
a
man
or
raise
him
when
you
know
his
cards
as
well
as
your
own.
It
was
as
much
a
part
of
a
sharper's
outfit
as
the
elastic
clip
upon
Sparrow
MacCoy's
arm.
Taking
that,
in
connection
with
the
recent
frauds
at
the
hotels,
the
police
might
have
got
hold
of
one
end
of
the
string.
"I
don't
think
there
is
much
more
for
me
to
explain.
We
got
to
a
village
called
Amersham
that
night
in
the
character
of
two
gentlemen
upon
a
walking
tour,
and
afterwards
we
made
our
way
quietly
to
London,
whence
MacCoy
went
on
to
Cairo
and
I
returned
to
New
York.
My
mother
died
six
months
afterwards,
and
I
am
glad
to
say
that
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
never
knew
what
happened.
She
was
always
under
the
delusion
that
Edward
was
earning
an
honest
living
in
London,
and
I
never
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
the
truth.
He
never
wrote;
but,
then,
he
never
did
write
at
any
time,
so
that
made
no
difference.
His
name
was
the
last
upon
her
lips.
"There's
just
one
other
thing
that
I
have
to
ask
you,
sir,
and
I
should
take
it
as
a
kind
return
for
