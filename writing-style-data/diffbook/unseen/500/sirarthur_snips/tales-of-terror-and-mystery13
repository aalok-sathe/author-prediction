the
deadly
jungle
of
the
outer
air.
"Once
out
of
danger
I
throttled
my
engine,
for
nothing
tears
a
machine
to
pieces
quicker
than
running
on
full
power
from
a
height.
It
was
a
glorious,
spiral
vol
plane
from
nearly
eight
miles
of
altitude
first,
to
the
level
of
the
silver
cloud
bank,
then
to
that
of
the
storm
cloud
beneath
it,
and
finally,
in
beating
rain,
to
the
surface
of
the
earth.
I
saw
the
Bristol
Channel
beneath
me
as
I
broke
from
the
clouds,
but,
having
still
some
petrol
in
my
tank,
I
got
twenty
miles
inland
before
I
found
myself
stranded
in
a
field
half
a
mile
from
the
village
of
Ashcombe.
There
I
got
three
tins
of
petrol
from
a
passing
motor
car,
and
at
ten
minutes
past
six
that
evening
I
alighted
gently
in
my
own
home
meadow
at
Devizes,
after
such
a
journey
as
no
mortal
upon
earth
has
ever
yet
taken
and
lived
to
tell
the
tale.
I
have
seen
the
beauty
and
I
have
seen
the
horror
of
the
heights
and
greater
beauty
or
greater
horror
than
that
is
not
within
the
ken
of
man.
"And
now
it
is
my
plan
to
go
once
again
before
I
give
my
results
to
the
world.
My
reason
for
this
is
that
I
must
surely
have
something
to
show
by
way
of
proof
before
I
lay
such
a
tale
before
my
fellow
men.
It
is
true
that
others
will
soon
follow
and
will
confirm
what
I
have
said,
and
yet
I
should
wish
to
carry
conviction
from
the
first.
Those
lovely
iridescent
bubbles
of
the
air
should
not
be
hard
to
capture.
They
drift
slowly
upon
their
way,
and
the
swift
monoplane
could
intercept
their
leisurely
course.
It
is
likely
enough
that
they
would
dissolve
in
the
heavier
layers
of
the
atmosphere,
and
that
some
small
heap
of
amorphous
jelly
might
be
all
that
I
should
bring
to
earth
with
me.
And
yet
something
there
would
surely
be
by
which
I
could
substantiate
my
story.
Yes,
I
will
go,
even
if
I
run
a
risk
by
doing
so.
These
purple
horrors
would
not
seem
to
be
numerous.
It
is
probable
that
I
shall
not
see
one.
If
I
do
I
shall
dive
at
once.
At
the
worst
there
is
always
the
shot
gun
and
my
knowledge
of

a

On
the

is
written,
in
large,
straggling
writing:
"Forty
three
thousand
feet.
I
shall
never
see
earth
again.
They
are
beneath
me,
three
of
them.
God
help
me;
it
is
a
dreadful
death
to
die!"
Such
in
its
entirety
is
the
Joyce
Armstrong
Statement.
Of
the
man
nothing
has
since
been
seen.
Pieces
of
his
shattered
monoplane

been
picked
up
in
the
preserves
of
Mr.

Lushington
upon
the

Kent
and
Sussex,
within
a
few
miles
of
the
spot
where
the
note
book
was
discovered.
If
the
unfortunate
aviator's
theory
is
correct
