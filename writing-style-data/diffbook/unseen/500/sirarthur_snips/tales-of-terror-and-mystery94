said
Lord
Linchmere.
"You
know
how
ladies'
social
duties
accumulate
if
they
have
been
for
some
time
in
the
country.
My
sister
has
many
old
friends
in
London
at
present."
"Well,
she
is
her
own
mistress,
and
I
should
not
wish
to
alter
her
plans,
but
I
shall
be
glad
when
I
see
her
again.
It
is
very
lonely
here
without
her
company."
"I
was
afraid
that
you
might
find
it
so,
and
that
was
partly
why
I
ran
down.
My
young
friend,
Dr.
Hamilton,
is
so
much
interested
in
the
subject
which
you
have
made
your
own,
that
I
thought
you
would
not
mind
his
accompanying
me."
"I
lead
a
retired
life,
Dr.
Hamilton,
and
my
aversion
to
strangers
grows
upon
me,"
said
our
host.
"I
have
sometimes
thought
that
my
nerves
are
not
so
good
as
they
were.
My
travels
in
search
of
beetles
in
my
younger
days
took
me
into
many
malarious
and
unhealthy
places.
But
a
brother
coleopterist
like
yourself
is
always
a
welcome
guest,
and
I
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
look
over
my
collection,
which
I
think
that
I
may
without
exaggeration
describe
as
the
best
in
Europe."
And
so
no
doubt
it
was.
He
had
a
huge,
oaken
cabinet
arranged
in
shallow
drawers,
and
here,
neatly
ticketed
and
classified,
were
beetles
from
every
corner
of
the
earth,
black,
brown,
blue,
green,
and
mottled.
Every
now
and
then
as
he
swept
his
hand
over
the
lines
and
lines
of
impaled
insects
he
would
catch
up
some
rare
specimen,
and,
handling
it
with
as
much
delicacy
and
reverence
as
if
it
were
a
precious
relic,
he
would
hold
forth
upon
its
peculiarities
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
came
into
his
possession.
It
was
evidently
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
meet
with
a
sympathetic
listener,
and
he
talked
and
talked
until
the
spring
evening
had
deepened
into
night,
and
the
gong
announced
that
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner.
All
the
time
Lord
Linchmere
said
nothing,
but
he
stood
at
his
brother
in
law's
elbow,
and
I
caught
him
continually
shooting
curious
little,
questioning
glances
into
his
face.
And
his
own
features
expressed
some
strong
emotion,
apprehension,
sympathy,
expectation:
I
seemed
to
read
them
all.
I
was
sure
that
Lord
Linchmere
was
fearing
something
and
awaiting
something,
but
what
that
something
might
be
I
could
not
imagine.
The
evening
passed
quietly
but
pleasantly,
and
I
should
have
been
entirely
at
my
ease
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
continual
sense
of
tension
upon
the
part
of
Lord
Linchmere.
As
to
our
host,
I
found
that
he
improved
upon
acquaintance.
He
spoke
constantly
with
affection
of
his
absent
wife,
and
also
of
his
little
son,
who
had
recently
been
sent
to
school.
The
house,
he
said,
was
not
the
same
without
them.
If
it
were
not
for
his
scientific
studies,
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
get
through
the
days.
After
dinner
we
smoked
for
some
time
in
the
billiard
room,
