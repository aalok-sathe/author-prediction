real
work
is
to
be
done.
Beaumont
found
that
out
in
very
early
days.
For
one
thing
it
doesn't
mind
damp,
and
the
weather
looks
as
if
we
should
be
in
the
clouds
all
the
time.
It's
a
bonny
little
model
and
answers
my
hand
like
a
tender
mouthed
horse.
The
engine
is
a
ten
cylinder
rotary
Robur
working
up
to
one
hundred
and
seventy
five.
It
has
all
the
modern
improvements
enclosed
fuselage,
high
curved
landing
skids,
brakes,
gyroscopic
steadiers,
and
three
speeds,
worked
by
an
alteration
of
the
angle
of
the
planes
upon
the
Venetian
blind
principle.
I
took
a
shot
gun
with
me
and
a
dozen
cartridges
filled
with
buck
shot.
You
should
have
seen
the
face
of
Perkins,
my
old
mechanic,
when
I
directed
him
to
put
them
in.
I
was
dressed
like
an
Arctic
explorer,
with
two
jerseys
under
my
overalls,
thick
socks
inside
my
padded
boots,
a
storm
cap
with
flaps,
and
my
talc
goggles.
It
was
stifling
outside
the
hangars,
but
I
was
going
for
the
summit
of
the
Himalayas,
and
had
to
dress
for
the
part.
Perkins
knew
there
was
something
on
and
implored
me
to
take
him
with
me.
Perhaps
I
should
if
I
were
using
the
biplane,
but
a
monoplane
is
a
one
man
show
if
you
want
to
get
the
last
foot
of
life
out
of
it.
Of
course,
I
took
an
oxygen
bag;
the
man
who
goes
for
the
altitude
record
without
one
will
either
be
frozen
or
smothered
or
both.
"I
had
a
good
look
at
the
planes,
the
rudder
bar,
and
the
elevating
lever
before
I
got
in.
Everything
was
in
order
so
far
as
I
could
see.
Then
I
switched
on
my
engine
and
found
that
she
was
running
sweetly.
When
they
let
her
go
she
rose
almost
at
once
upon
the
lowest
speed.
I
circled
my
home
field
once
or
twice
just
to
warm
her
up,
and
then
with
a
wave
to
Perkins
and
the
others,
I
flattened
out
my
planes
and
put
her
on
her
highest.
She
skimmed
like
a
swallow
down
wind
for
eight
or
ten
miles
until
I
turned
her
nose
up
a
little
and
she
began
to
climb
in
a
great
spiral
for
the
cloud
bank
above
me.
It's
all
important
to
rise
slowly
and
adapt
yourself
to
the
pressure
as
you
go.
"It
was
a
close,
warm
day
for
an
English
September,
and
there
was
the
hush
and
heaviness
of
impending
rain.
Now
and
then
there
came
sudden
puffs
of
wind
from
the
south
west
one
of
them
so
gusty
and
unexpected
that
it
caught
me
napping
and
turned
me
half
round
for
an
instant.
I
remember
the
time
when
gusts
and
whirls
and
air
pockets
used
to
be
things
of
danger
before
we
learned
to
put
an
overmastering
power
into
our
engines.
Just
as
I
reached
the
cloud
banks,
with
the
altimeter
marking
three
thousand,
down
came
the
rain.
My
word,
how
it
poured!
It
drummed
upon
my
