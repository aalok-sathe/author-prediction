had
occurred,
when,
drawn
by
the
death
cries
of
their
master,
they
found
me
behind
the
bars,
and
his
remains
or
what
they
afterwards
discovered
to
be
his
remains
in
the
clutch
of
the
creature
which
he
had
reared.
They
stalled
him
off
with
hot
irons,
and
afterwards
shot
him
through
the
loophole
of
the
door
before
they
could
finally
extricate
me.
I
was
carried
to
my
bedroom,
and
there,
under
the
roof
of
my
would
be
murderer,
I
remained
between
life
and
death
for
several
weeks.
They
had
sent
for
a
surgeon
from
Clipton
and
a
nurse
from
London,
and
in
a
month
I
was
able
to
be
carried
to
the
station,
and
so
conveyed
back
once
more
to
Grosvenor
Mansions.
I
have
one
remembrance
of
that
illness,
which
might
have
been
part
of
the
ever
changing
panorama
conjured
up
by
a
delirious
brain
were
it
not
so
definitely
fixed
in
my
memory.
One
night,
when
the
nurse
was
absent,
the
door
of
my
chamber
opened,
and
a
tall
woman
in
blackest
mourning
slipped
into
the
room.
She
came
across
to
me,
and
as
she
bent
her
sallow
face
I
saw
by
the
faint
gleam
of
the
night
light
that
it
was
the
Brazilian
woman
whom
my
cousin
had
married.
She
stared
intently
into
my
face,
and
her
expression
was
more
kindly
than
I
had
ever
seen
it.
"Are
you
conscious?"
she
asked.
I
feebly
nodded
for
I
was
still
very
weak.
"Well;
then,
I
only
wished
to
say
to
you
that
you
have
yourself
to
blame.
Did
I
not
do
all
I
could
for
you?
From
the
beginning
I
tried
to
drive
you
from
the
house.
By
every
means,
short
of
betraying
my
husband,
I
tried
to
save
you
from
him.
I
knew
that
he
had
a
reason
for
bringing
you
here.
I
knew
that
he
would
never
let
you
get
away
again.
No
one
knew
him
as
I
knew
him,
who
had
suffered
from
him
so
often.
I
did
not
dare
to
tell
you
all
this.
He
would
have
killed
me.
But
I
did
my
best
for
you.
As
things
have
turned
out,
you
have
been
the
best
friend
that
I
have
ever
had.
You
have
set
me
free,
and
I
fancied
that
nothing
but
death
would
do
that.
I
am
sorry
if
you
are
hurt,
but
I
cannot
reproach
myself.
I
told
you
that
you
were
a
fool
and
a
fool
you
have
been."
She
crept
out
of
the
room,
the
bitter,
singular
woman,
and
I
was
never
destined
to
see
her
again.
With
what
remained
from
her
husband's
property
she
went
back
to
her
native
land,
and
I
have
heard
that
she
afterwards
took
the
veil
at
Pernambuco.
It
was
not
until
I
had
been
back
in
London
for
some
time
that
the
doctors
pronounced
me
to
be
well
enough
to
do
business.
It
was
not
a
very
welcome
permission
to
me,
for
I
feared
that
it
would
be
the
signal
for
an
inrush
of
