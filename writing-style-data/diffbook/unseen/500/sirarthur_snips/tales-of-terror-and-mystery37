knocker.
An
instant
later
there
was
the
shuffling
of
feet
in
the
hall,
and
the
sharp
closing
of
a
door.
"A
patient
to
see
you,
sir,
in
the
consulting
room,"
said
the
butler.
"About
himself?"
"No,
sir;
I
think
he
wants
you
to
go
out."
"It
is
too
late,"
cried
Douglas
Stone
peevishly.
"I
won't
go."
"This
is
his
card,
sir."
The
butler
presented
it
upon
the
gold
salver
which
had
been
given
to
his
master
by
the
wife
of
a
Prime
Minister.
"'Hamil
Ali,
Smyrna.'
Hum!
The
fellow
is
a
Turk,
I
suppose."
"Yes,
sir.
He
seems
as
if
he
came
from
abroad,
sir.
And
he's
in
a
terrible
way."
"Tut,
tut!
I
have
an
engagement.
I
must
go
somewhere
else.
But
I'll
see
him.
Show
him
in
here,
Pim."
A
few
moments
later
the
butler
swung
open
the
door
and
ushered
in
a
small
and
decrepit
man,
who
walked
with
a
bent
back
and
with
the
forward
push
of
the
face
and
blink
of
the
eyes
which
goes
with
extreme
short
sight.
His
face
was
swarthy,
and
his
hair
and
beard
of
the
deepest
black.
In
one
hand
he
held
a
turban
of
white
muslin
striped
with
red,
in
the
other
a
small
chamois
leather
bag.
"Good
evening,"
said
Douglas
Stone,
when
the
butler
had
closed
the
door.
"You
speak
English,
I
presume?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
am
from
Asia
Minor,
but
I
speak
English
when
I
speak
slow."
"You
wanted
me
to
go
out,
I
understand?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
wanted
very
much
that
you
should
see
my
wife."
"I
could
come
in
the
morning,
but
I
have
an
engagement
which
prevents
me
from
seeing
your
wife
tonight."
The
Turk's
answer
was
a
singular
one.
He
pulled
the
string
which
closed
the
mouth
of
the
chamois
leather
bag,
and
poured
a
flood
of
gold
on
to
the
table.
"There
are
one
hundred
pounds
there,"
said
he,
"and
I
promise
you
that
it
will
not
take
you
an
hour.
I
have
a
cab
ready
at
the
door."
Douglas
Stone
glanced
at
his
watch.
An
hour
would
not
make
it
too
late
to
visit
Lady
Sannox.
He
had
been
there
later.
And
the
fee
was
an
extraordinarily
high
one.
He
had
been
pressed
by
his
creditors
lately,
and
he
could
not
afford
to
let
such
a
chance
pass.
He
would
go.
"What
is
the
case?"
he
asked.
"Oh,
it
is
so
sad
a
one!
So
sad
a
one!
You
have
not,
perhaps
heard
of
the
daggers
of
the
Almohades?"
"Never."
"Ah,
they
are
Eastern
daggers
of
a
great
age
and
of
a
singular
shape,
with
the
hilt
like
what
you
call
a
stirrup.
I
am
a
curiosity
dealer,
you
understand,
and
that
is
why
I
have
come
to
England
from
Smyrna,
but
next
week
I
go
back
once
more.
Many
things
I
brought
with
me,
and
I
have
a
few
things
left,
but
among
them,
to
my
sorrow,
is
one
of
these
daggers."
"You
will
remember
that
I
have
an
appointment,
