seem,
nothing
has
transpired
during
these
eight
years
which
has
shed
the
least
light
upon
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
the
special
train
which
contained
Monsieur
Caratal
and
his
companion.
Careful
inquiries
into
the
antecedents
of
the
two
travellers
have
only
established
the
fact
that
Monsieur
Caratal
was
well
known
as
a
financier
and
political
agent
in
Central
America,
and
that
during
his
voyage
to
Europe
he
had
betrayed
extraordinary
anxiety
to
reach
Paris.
His
companion,
whose
name
was
entered
upon
the
passenger
lists
as
Eduardo
Gomez,
was
a
man
whose
record
was
a
violent
one,
and
whose
reputation
was
that
of
a
bravo
and
a
bully.
There
was
evidence
to
show,
however,
that
he
was
honestly
devoted
to
the
interests
of
Monsieur
Caratal,
and
that
the
latter,
being
a
man
of
puny
physique,
employed
the
other
as
a
guard
and
protector.
It
may
be
added
that
no
information
came
from
Paris
as
to
what
the
objects
of
Monsieur
Caratal's
hurried
journey
may
have
been.
This
comprises
all
the
facts
of
the
case
up
to
the
publication
in
the
Marseilles
papers
of
the
recent
confession
of
Herbert
de
Lernac,
now
under
sentence
of
death
for
the
murder
of
a
merchant
named
Bonvalot.
This
statement
may
be
literally
translated
as
follows:
"It
is
not
out
of
mere
pride
or
boasting
that
I
give
this
information,
for,
if
that
were
my
object,
I
could
tell
a
dozen
actions
of
mine
which
are
quite
as
splendid;
but
I
do
it
in
order
that
certain
gentlemen
in
Paris
may
understand
that
I,
who
am
able
here
to
tell
about
the
fate
of
Monsieur
Caratal,
can
also
tell
in
whose
interest
and
at
whose
request
the
deed
was
done,
unless
the
reprieve
which
I
am
awaiting
comes
to
me
very
quickly.
Take
warning,
messieurs,
before
it
is
too
late!
You
know
Herbert
de
Lernac,
and
you
are
aware
that
his
deeds
are
as
ready
as
his
words.
Hasten
then,
or
you
are
lost!
"At
present
I
shall
mention
no
names
if
you
only
heard
the
names,
what
would
you
not
think!
but
I
shall
merely
tell
you
how
cleverly
I
did
it.
I
was
true
to
my
employers
then,
and
no
doubt
they
will
be
true
to
me
now.
I
hope
so,
and
until
I
am
convinced
that
they
have
betrayed
me,
these
names,
which
would
convulse
Europe,
shall
not
be
divulged.
But
on
that
day
...
well,
I
say
no
more!
"In
a
word,
then,
there
was
a
famous
trial
in
Paris,
in
the
year
1890,
in
connection
with
a
monstrous
scandal
in
politics
and
finance.
How
monstrous
that
scandal
was
can
never
be
known
save
by
such
confidential
agents
as
myself.
The
honour
and
careers
of
many
of
the
chief
men
in
France
were
at
stake.
You
have
seen
a
group
of
ninepins
standing,
all
so
rigid,
and
prim,
and
unbending.
Then
there
comes
the
ball
from
far
away
and
pop,
pop,
pop
there
are
your
ninepins
on
the
floor.
Well,
imagine
some
of
