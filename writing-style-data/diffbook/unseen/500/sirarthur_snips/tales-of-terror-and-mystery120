henceforward,
it
was
locked
within
his
bureau.
Sir
John
took
no
steps
to
repair
the
damage,
and
I
never
had
an
opportunity
of
searching
for
that
secret
passage,
the
existence
of
which
I
had
surmised.
As
to
the
lady,
I
had
thought
that
this
would
have
brought
her
visits
to
an
end,
had
I
not
one
evening
heard
Mr.
Richards
asking
Mrs.
Stevens
who
the
woman
was
whom
he
had
overheard
talking
to
Sir
John
in
the
library.
I
could
not
catch
her
reply,
but
I
saw
from
her
manner
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
had
to
answer
or
avoid
the
same
question.
"You've
heard
the
voice,
Colmore?"
said
the
agent.
I
confessed
that
I
had.
"And
what
do
YOU
think
of
it?"
I
shrugged
my
shoulders,
and
remarked
that
it
was
no
business
of
mine.
"Come,
come,
you
are
just
as
curious
as
any
of
us.
Is
it
a
woman
or
not?"
"It
is
certainly
a
woman."
"Which
room
did
you
hear
it
from?"
"From
the
turret
room,
before
the
ceiling
fell."
"But
I
heard
it
from
the
library
only
last
night.
I
passed
the
doors
as
I
was
going
to
bed,
and
I
heard
something
wailing
and
praying
just
as
plainly
as
I
hear
you.
It
may
be
a
woman
"
"Why,
what
else
COULD
it
be?"
He
looked
at
me
hard.
"There
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth,"
said
he.
"If
it
is
a
woman,
how
does
she
get
there?"
"I
don't
know."
"No,
nor
I.
But
if
it
is
the
other
thing
but
there,
for
a
practical
business
man
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
is
rather
a
ridiculous
line
of
conversation."
He
turned
away,
but
I
saw
that
he
felt
even
more
than
he
had
said.
To
all
the
old
ghost
stories
of
Thorpe
Place
a
new
one
was
being
added
before
our
very
eyes.
It
may
by
this
time
have
taken
its
permanent
place,
for
though
an
explanation
came
to
me,
it
never
reached
the
others.
And
my
explanation
came
in
this
way.
I
had
suffered
a
sleepless
night
from
neuralgia,
and
about
midday
I
had
taken
a
heavy
dose
of
chlorodyne
to
alleviate
the
pain.
At
that
time
I
was
finishing
the
indexing
of
Sir
John
Bollamore's
library,
and
it
was
my
custom
to
work
there
from
five
till
seven.
On
this
particular
day
I
struggled
against
the
double
effect
of
my
bad
night
and
the
narcotic.
I
have
already
mentioned
that
there
was
a
recess
in
the
library,
and
in
this
it
was
my
habit
to
work.
I
settled
down
steadily
to
my
task,
but
my
weariness
overcame
me
and,
falling
back
upon
the
settee,
I
dropped
into
a
heavy
sleep.
How
long
I
slept
I
do
not
know,
but
it
was
quite
dark
when
I
awoke.
Confused
by
the
chlorodyne
which
I
had
taken,
I
lay
motionless
in
a
semi
conscious
state.
The
great
room
with
its
high
walls
covered
with
books
loomed
