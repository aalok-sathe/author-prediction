gradually
the
lid
was
swinging
back,
and
the
black
slit
which
marked
the
opening
was
becoming
wider
and
wider.
So
gently
and
carefully
was
it
done
that
the
movement
was
almost
imperceptible.
Then,
as
we
breathlessly
watched
it,
a
white
thin
hand
appeared
at
the
opening,
pushing
back
the
painted
lid,
then
another
hand,
and
finally
a
face
a
face
which
was
familiar
to
us
both,
that
of
Professor
Andreas.
Stealthily
he
slunk
out
of
the
mummy
case,
like
a
fox
stealing
from
its
burrow,
his
head
turning
incessantly
to
left
and
to
right,
stepping,
then
pausing,
then
stepping
again,
the
very
image
of
craft
and
of
caution.
Once
some
sound
in
the
street
struck
him
motionless,
and
he
stood
listening,
with
his
ear
turned,
ready
to
dart
back
to
the
shelter
behind
him.
Then
he
crept
onwards
again
upon
tiptoe,
very,
very
softly
and
slowly,
until
he
had
reached
the
case
in
the
centre
of
the
room.
There
he
took
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket,
unlocked
the
case,
took
out
the
Jewish
breastplate,
and,
laying
it
upon
the
glass
in
front
of
him,
began
to
work
upon
it
with
some
sort
of
small,
glistening
tool.
He
was
so
directly
underneath
us
that
his
bent
head
covered
his
work,
but
we
could
guess
from
the
movement
of
his
hand
that
he
was
engaged
in
finishing
the
strange
disfigurement
which
he
had
begun.
I
could
realize
from
the
heavy
breathing
of
my
companion,
and
the
twitchings
of
the
hand
which
still
clutched
my
wrist,
the
furious
indignation
which
filled
his
heart
as
he
saw
this
vandalism
in
the
quarter
of
all
others
where
he
could
least
have
expected
it.
He,
the
very
man
who
a
fortnight
before
had
reverently
bent
over
this
unique
relic,
and
who
had
impressed
its
antiquity
and
its
sanctity
upon
us,
was
now
engaged
in
this
outrageous
profanation.
It
was
impossible,
unthinkable
and
yet
there,
in
the
white
glare
of
the
electric
light
beneath
us,
was
that
dark
figure
with
the
bent
grey
head,
and
the
twitching
elbow.
What
inhuman
hypocrisy,
what
hateful
depth
of
malice
against
his
successor
must
underlie
these
sinister
nocturnal
labours.
It
was
painful
to
think
of
and
dreadful
to
watch.
Even
I,
who
had
none
of
the
acute
feelings
of
a
virtuoso,
could
not
bear
to
look
on
and
see
this
deliberate
mutilation
of
so
ancient
a
relic.
It
was
a
relief
to
me
when
my
companion
tugged
at
my
sleeve
as
a
signal
that
I
was
to
follow
him
as
he
softly
crept
out
of
the
room.
It
was
not
until
we
were
within
his
own
quarters
that
he
opened
his
lips,
and
then
I
saw
by
his
agitated
face
how
deep
was
his
consternation.
"The
abominable
Goth!"
he
cried.
"Could
you
have
believed
it?"
"It
is
amazing."
"He
is
a
villain
or
a
lunatic
one
or
the
other.
We
shall
very
soon
see
which.
Come
with
me,
Jackson,
and
we
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
black
