The
ultimate
research
tool,
Langdon
had
heard.
Instant
answers
to
any
religious
historical
question.
He
wondered
what
the
database
would
have
to
say
about
"a
knight
a
Pope
interred."
He
stood
up
and
paced,
wishing
the
train
would
hurry.
At
the
pay
phone,
Sophie's
call
finally
connected
to
the
London
police.
"Snow
Hill
Division,"
the
dispatcher
said.
"How
may
I
direct
your
call?"
"I'm
reporting
a
kidnapping."
Sophie
knew
to
be
concise.
"Name
please?"
Sophie
paused.
"Agent
Sophie
Neveu
with
the
French
Judicial
Police."
The
title
had
the
desired
effect.
"Right
away,
ma'am.
Let
me
get
a
detective
on
the
line
for
you."
As
the
call
went
through,
Sophie
began
wondering
if
the
police
would
even
believe
her
description
of
Teabing's
captors.
A
man
in
a
tuxedo.
How
much
easier
to
identify
could
a
suspect
be?
Even
if
Remy
changed
clothes,
he
was
partnered
with
an
albino
monk.
Impossible
to
miss.
Moreover,
they
had
a
hostage
and
could
not
take
public
transportation.
She
wondered
how
many
Jaguar
stretch
limos
there
could
be
in
London.
Sophie's
connection
to
the
detective
seemed
to
be
taking
forever.
Come
on!
She
could
hear
the
line
clicking
and
buzzing,
as
if
she
was
being
transferred.
Fifteen
seconds
passed.
Finally
a
man
came
on
the
line.
"Agent
Neveu?"
Stunned,
Sophie
registered
the
gruff
tone
immediately.
"Agent
Neveu,"
Bezu
Fache
demanded.
"Where
the
hell
are
you?"
Sophie
was
speechless.
Captain
Fache
had
apparently
requested
the
London
police
dispatcher
alert
him
if
Sophie
called
in.
"Listen,"
Fache
said,
speaking
to
her
in
terse
French.
"I
made
a
terrible
mistake
tonight.
Robert
Langdon
is
innocent.
All
charges
against
him
have
been
dropped.
Even
so,
both
of
you
are
in
danger.
You
need
to
come
in."
Sophie's
jaw
fell
slack.
She
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
Fache
was
not
a
man
who
apologized
for
anything.
"You
did
not
tell
me,"
Fache
continued,
"that
Jacques
Sauniere
was
your
grandfather.
I
fully
intend
to
overlook
your
insubordination
last
night
on
account
of
the
emotional
stress
you
must
be
under.
At
the
moment,
however,
you
and
Langdon
need
to
go
to
the
nearest
London
police
headquarters
for
refuge."
He
knows
I'm
in
London?
What
else
does
Fache
know?
Sophie
heard
what
sounded
like
drilling
or
machinery
in
the
background.
She
also
heard
an
odd
clicking
on
the
line.
"Are
you
tracing
this
call,
Captain?"
Fache's
voice
was
firm
now.
"You
and
I
need
to
cooperate,
Agent
Neveu.
We
both
have
a
lot
to
lose
here.
This
is
damage
control.
I
made
errors
in
judgment
last
night,
and
if
those
errors
result
in
the
deaths
of
an
American
professor
and
a
DCPJ
cryptologist,
my
career
will
be
over.
I've
been
trying
to
pull
you
back
into
safety
for
the
last
several
hours."
A
warm
wind
was
now
pushing
through
the
station
as
a
train
approached
with
a
low
rumble.
Sophie
had
every
intention
of
being
on
it.
Langdon
apparently
had
the
same
idea;
he
was
gathering
himself
together
and
moving
toward
her
now.
