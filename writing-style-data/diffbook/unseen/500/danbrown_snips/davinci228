hear
Teabing's
muffled
cries
and
realized
Remy
had
used
some
of
the
old
duct
tape
to
gag
him.
"Ferme
ta
gueule!"
Remy
shouted
over
his
shoulder
at
Teabing.
Reaching
to
a
control
panel
on
the
elaborate
dash,
Remy
pressed
a
button.
An
opaque
partition
raised
behind
them,
sealing
off
the
back.
Teabing
disappeared,
and
his
voice
was
silenced.
Remy
glanced
at
Silas.
"I've
been
listening
to
his
miserable
whimpering
long
enough."
Minutes
later,
as
the
Jaguar
stretch
limo
powered
through
the
streets,
Silas's
cell
phone
rang.
The
Teacher.
He
answered
excitedly.
"Hello?"
"Silas,"
the
Teacher's
familiar
French
accent
said,
"I
am
relieved
to
hear
your
voice.
This
means
you
are
safe."
Silas
was
equally
comforted
to
hear
the
Teacher.
It
had
been
hours,
and
the
operation
had
veered
wildly
off
course.
Now,
at
last,
it
seemed
to
be
back
on
track.
"I
have
the
keystone."
"This
is
superb
news,"
the
Teacher
told
him.
"Is
Remy
with
you?"
Silas
was
surprised
to
hear
the
Teacher
use
Remy's
name.
"Yes.
Remy
freed
me."
"As
I
ordered
him
to
do.
I
am
only
sorry
you
had
to
endure
captivity
for
so
long."
"Physical
discomfort
has
no
meaning.
The
important
thing
is
that
the
keystone
is
ours."
"Yes.
I
need
it
delivered
to
me
at
once.
Time
is
of
the
essence."
Silas
was
eager
to
meet
the
Teacher
face
to
face
at
last.
"Yes,
sir,
I
would
be
honored."
"Silas,
I
would
like
Remy
to
bring
it
to
me."
Remy?
Silas
was
crestfallen.
After
everything
Silas
had
done
for
the
Teacher,
he
had
believed
he
would
be
the
one
to
hand
over
the
prize.
The
Teacher
favors
Remy?
"I
sense
your
disappointment,"
the
Teacher
said,
"which
tells
me
you
do
not
understand
my
meaning."
He
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper.
"You
must
believe
that
I
would
much
prefer
to
receive
the
keystone
from
you
a
man
of
God
rather
than
a
criminal
but
Remy
must
be
dealt
with.
He
disobeyed
my
orders
and
made
a
grave
mistake
that
has
put
our
entire
mission
at
risk.
Silas
felt
a
chill
and
glanced
over
at
Remy.
Kidnapping
Teabing
had
not
been
part
of
the
plan,
and
deciding
what
to
do
with
him
posed
a
new
problem.
"You
and
I
are
men
of
God,"
the
Teacher
whispered.
"We
cannot
be
deterred
from
our
goal."
There
was
an
ominous
pause
on
the
line.
"For
this
reason
alone,
I
will
ask
Remy
to
bring
me
the
keystone.
Do
you
understand?"
Silas
sensed
anger
in
the
Teacher's
voice
and
was
surprised
the
man
was
not
more
understanding.
Showing
his
face
could
not
be
avoided,
Silas
thought.
Remy
did
what
he
had
to
do.
He
saved
the
keystone.
"I
understand,"
Silas
managed.
"Good.
For
your
own
safety,
you
need
to
get
off
the
street
immediately.
The
police
will
be
looking
for
the
limousine
soon,
and
I
do
not
want
you
caught.
Opus
Dei
has
a
residence
in
London,
no?"
"Of
course."
"And
you
are
welcome
there?"
"As
a
brother."
"Then
