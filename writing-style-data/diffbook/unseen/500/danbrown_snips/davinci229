go
there
and
stay
out
of
sight.
I
will
call
you
the
moment
I
am
in
possession
of
the
keystone
and
have
attended
to
my
current
problem.
"You
are
in
London?"
"Do
as
I
say,
and
everything
will
be
fine."
"Yes,
sir."
The
Teacher
heaved
a
sigh,
as
if
what
he
now
had
to
do
was
profoundly
regrettable.
"It's
time
I
speak
to
Remy."
Silas
handed
Remy
the
phone,
sensing
it
might
be
the
last
call
Remy
Legaludec
ever
took.
As
Remy
took
the
phone,
he
knew
this
poor,
twisted
monk
had
no
idea
what
fate
awaited
him
now
that
he
had
served
his
purpose.
The
Teacher
used
you,
Silas.
And
your
bishop
is
a
pawn.
Remy
still
marveled
at
the
Teacher's
powers
of
persuasion.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
trusted
everything.
He
had
been
blinded
by
his
own
desperation.
Aringarosa
was
far
too
eager
to
believe.
Although
Remy
did
not
particularly
like
the
Teacher,
he
felt
pride
at
having
gained
the
man's
trust
and
helped
him
so
substantially.
have
earned
my
payday.
"Listen
carefully,"
the
Teacher
said.
"Take
Silas
to
the
Opus
Dei
residence
hall
and
drop
him
off
a
few
streets
away.
Then
drive
to
St.
James's
Park.
It
is
adjacent
to
Parliament
and
Big
Ben.
You
can
park
the
limousine
on
Horse
Guards
Parade.
We'll
talk
there."
With
that,
the
connection
went
dead.
King's
College,
established
by
King
George
IV
in
1829,
houses
its
Department
of
Theology
and
Religious
Studies
adjacent
to
Parliament
on
property
granted
by
the
Crown.
King's
College
Religion
Department
boasts
not
only
150
years'
experience
in
teaching
and
research,
but
the
1982
establishment
of
the
Research
Institute
in
Systematic
Theology,
which
possesses
one
of
the
most
complete
and
electronically
advanced
religious
research
libraries
in
the
world.
Langdon
still
felt
shaky
as
he
and
Sophie
came
in
from
the
rain
and
entered
the
library.
The
primary
research
room
was
as
Teabing
had
described
it
a
dramatic
octagonal
chamber
dominated
by
an
enormous
round
table
around
which
King
Arthur
and
his
knights
might
have
been
comfortable
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
twelve
flat
screen
computer
workstations.
On
the
far
side
of
the
room,
a
reference
librarian
was
just
pouring
a
pot
of
tea
and
settling
in
for
her
day
of
work.
"Lovely
morning,"
she
said
in
a
cheerful
British
accent,
leaving
the
tea
and
walking
over.
"May
I
help
you?"
"Thank
you,
yes,"
Langdon
replied.
"My
name
is
"Robert
Langdon."
She
gave
a
pleasant
smile.
"I
know
who
you
are."
For
an
instant,
he
feared
Fache
had
put
him
on
English
television
as
well,
but
the
librarian's
smile
suggested
otherwise.
Langdon
still
had
not
gotten
used
to
these
moments
of
unexpected
celebrity.
Then
again,
if
anyone
on
earth
were
going
to
recognize
his
face,
it
would
be
a
librarian
in
a
Religious
Studies
reference
facility.
"Pamela
Gettum,"
the
librarian
said,
offering
her
hand.
She
had
a
genial,
erudite
face
and
a
pleasingly
fluid
voice.
The
horn
rimmed
glasses
hanging
around
her
neck
were
thick.
"A
