immediately
banished
the
painting
to
a
warehouse
across
the
street.
Visitors
at
the
gallery's
Leonardo
Room
now
found
a
misleading
and
unapologetic
plaque
where
the
Adoration
once
hung.
THIS
WORK
IS
UNDERGOING
DIAGNOSTIC
TESTS
IN
PREPARATION
FOR
RESTORATION.
In
the
bizarre
underworld
of
modern
Grail
seekers,
Leonardo
da
Vinci
remained
the
quest's
great
enigma.
His
artwork
seemed
bursting
to
tell
a
secret,
and
yet
whatever
it
was
remained
hidden,
perhaps
beneath
a
layer
of
paint,
perhaps
enciphered
in
plain
view,
or
perhaps
nowhere
at
all.
Maybe
Da
Vinci's
plethora
of
tantalizing
clues
was
nothing
but
an
empty
promise
left
behind
to
frustrate
the
curious
and
bring
a
smirk
to
the
face
of
his
knowing
Mona
Lisa.
"Is
it
possible,"
Sophie
asked,
drawing
Langdon
back,
"that
the
key
you're
holding
unlocks
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon's
laugh
sounded
forced,
even
to
him.
"I
really
can't
imagine.
Besides,
the
Grail
is
believed
to
be
hidden
in
the
United
Kingdom
somewhere,
not
France."
He
gave
her
the
quick
history.
"But
the
Grail
seems
the
only
rational
conclusion,"
she
insisted.
"We
have
an
extremely
secure
key,
stamped
with
the
Priory
of
Sion
seal,
delivered
to
us
by
a
member
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
a
brotherhood
which,
you
just
told
me,
are
guardians
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Langdon
knew
her
contention
was
logical,
and
yet
intuitively
he
could
not
possibly
accept
it.
Rumors
existed
that
the
Priory
had
vowed
someday
to
bring
the
Grail
back
to
France
to
a
final
resting
place,
but
certainly
no
historical
evidence
existed
to
suggest
that
this
indeed
had
happened.
Even
if
the
Priory
had
managed
to
bring
the
Grail
back
to
France,
the
address
24
Rue
Haxo
near
a
tennis
stadium
hardly
sounded
like
a
noble
final
resting
place.
"Sophie,
I
really
don't
see
how
this
key
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Grail."
"Because
the
Grail
is
supposed
to
be
in
England?"
"Not
only
that.
The
location
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
in
history.
Priory
members
wait
decades
proving
themselves
trustworthy
before
being
elevated
to
the
highest
echelons
of
the
fraternity
and
learning
where
the
Grail
is.
That
secret
is
protected
by
an
intricate
system
of
compartmentalized
knowledge,
and
although
the
Priory
brotherhood
is
very
large,
only
four
members
at
any
given
time
know
where
the
Grail
is
hidden
the
Grand
Master
and
his
three
senechaux.
The
probability
of
your
grandfather
being
one
of
those
four
top
people
is
very
slim."
My
grandfather
was
one
of
them,
Sophie
thought,
pressing
down
on
the
accelerator.
She
had
an
image
stamped
in
her
memory
that
confirmed
her
grandfather's
status
within
the
brotherhood
beyond
any
doubt.
"And
even
if
your
grandfather
were
in
the
upper
echelon,
he
would
never
be
allowed
to
reveal
anything
to
anyone
outside
the
brotherhood.
It
is
inconceivable
that
he
would
bring
you
into
the
inner
circle."
I've
already
been
there,
Sophie
thought,
picturing
the
ritual
in
the
basement.
She
wondered
if
this
were
the
moment
