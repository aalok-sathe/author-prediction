Langdon
spoke
his
lines
with
Teabing
esque
belie
vability.
The
altar
boy's
expression
turned
even
more
skeptical.
"These
are
not
tombs.
"I'm
sorry?"
Langdon
said.
"Of
course
they
are
tombs,"
Teabing
declared.
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
The
altar
boy
shook
his
head.
"Tombs
contain
bodies.
These
are
effigies.
Stone
tributes
to
real
men.
There
are
no
bodies
beneath
these
figures."
"This
is
a
crypt!"
Teabing
said.
"Only
in
outdated
history
books.
This
was
believed
to
be
a
crypt
but
was
revealed
as
nothing
of
the
sort
during
the
1950
renovation."
He
turned
back
to
Langdon.
"And
I
imagine
Mr.
Wren
would
know
that.
Considering
it
was
his
family
that
uncovered
that
fact.
An
uneasy
silence
fell.
It
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
a
door
slamming
out
in
the
annex.
"That
must
be
Father
Knowles,"
Teabing
said.
"Perhaps
you
should
go
see?"
The
altar
boy
looked
doubtful
but
stalked
back
toward
the
annex,
leaving
Langdon,
Sophie,
and
Teabing
to
eye
one
another
gloomily.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
whispered.
"No
bodies?
What
is
he
talking
about?"
Teabing
looked
distraught.
"I
don't
know.
I
always
thought
certainly,
this
must
be
the
place.
I
can't
imagine
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
about.
It
makes
no
sense
!
"Can
I
see
the
poem
again?"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
pulled
the
cryptex
from
her
pocket
and
carefully
handed
it
to
him.
Langdon
unwrapped
the
vellum,
holding
the
cryptex
in
his
hand
while
he
examined
the
poem.
"Yes,
the
poem
definitely
references
a
tomb.
Not
an
effigy."
"Could
the
poem
be
wrong?"
Teabing
asked.
"Could
Jacques
Sauniere
have
made
the
same
mistake
I
just
did?"
Langdon
considered
it
and
shook
his
head.
"Leigh,
you
said
it
yourself.
This
church
was
built
by
Templars,
the
military
arm
of
the
Priory.
Something
tells
me
the
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
would
have
a
pretty
good
idea
if
there
were
knights
buried
here."
Teabing
looked
flabbergasted.
"But
this
place
is
perfect."
He
wheeled
back
toward
the
knights.
"We
must
be
missing
something!"
Entering
the
annex,
the
altar
boy
was
surprised
to
find
it
deserted.
"Father
Knowles?"
know
I
heard
the
door,
he
thought,
moving
forward
until
he
could
see
the
entryway.
A
thin
man
in
a
tuxedo
stood
near
the
doorway,
scratching
his
head
and
looking
lost.
The
altar
boy
gave
an
irritated
huff,
realizing
he
had
forgotten
to
relock
the
door
when
he
let
the
others
in.
Now
some
pathetic
sod
had
wandered
in
off
the
street,
looking
for
directions
to
some
wedding
from
the
looks
of
it.
"I'm
sorry,"
he
called
out,
passing
a
large
pillar,
"we're
closed."
A
flurry
of
cloth
ruffled
behind
him,
and
before
the
altar
boy
could
turn,
his
head
snapped
backward,
a
powerful
hand
clamping
hard
over
his
mouth
from
behind,
muffling
his
scream.
The
hand
over
the
boy's
mouth
was
snow
white,
and
he
smelled
alcohol.
The
prim
man
in
the
tuxedo
calmly
produced
a
very
small
revolver,
which
he
aimed
directly
at
the
boy's
forehead.
The
altar
boy
felt
his
groin
