"knight's
tomb,"
which,
according
to
the
poem,
would
provide
the
password
for
opening
the
smaller
cryptex.
Teabing
grinned
and
turned
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
give
the
Harvard
boy
one
more
shot
at
the
verse,
will
you?"
Sophie
fished
in
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
black
cryptex,
which
was
wrapped
in
the
vellum.
Everyone
had
decided
to
leave
the
rosewood
box
and
larger
cryptex
behind
in
the
plane's
strongbox,
carrying
with
them
only
what
they
needed,
the
far
more
portable
and
discreet
black
cryptex.
Sophie
unwrapped
the
vellum
and
handed
the
sheet
to
Langdon.
Although
Langdon
had
read
the
poem
several
times
onboard
the
jet,
he
had
been
unable
to
extract
any
specific
location.
Now,
as
he
read
the
words
again,
he
processed
them
slowly
and
carefully,
hoping
the
pentametric
rhythms
would
reveal
a
clearer
meaning
now
that
he
was
on
the
ground.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
The
language
seemed
simple
enough.
There
was
a
knight
buried
in
London.
A
knight
who
labored
at
something
that
angered
the
Church.
A
knight
whose
tomb
was
missing
an
orb
that
should
be
present.
The
poem's
final
reference
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb
was
a
clear
allusion
to
Mary
Magdalene,
the
Rose
who
bore
the
seed
of
Jesus.
Despite
the
apparent
straightforwardness
of
the
verse,
Langdon
still
had
no
idea
who
this
knight
was
or
where
he
was
buried.
Moreover,
once
they
located
the
tomb,
it
sounded
as
if
they
would
be
searching
for
something
that
was
absent.
The
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb
?
"No
thoughts?"
Teabing
clucked
in
disappointment,
although
Langdon
sensed
the
Royal
Historian
was
enjoying
being
one
up.
"Miss
Neveu?"
She
shook
her
head.
"What
would
you
two
do
without
me?"
Teabing
said.
"Very
well,
I
will
walk
you
through
it.
It's
quite
simple
really.
The
first
line
is
the
key.
Would
you
read
it
please?"
Langdon
read
aloud.
"
'In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.'
"Precisely.
A
knight
a
Pope
interred."
He
eyed
Langdon.
"What
does
that
mean
to
you?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"A
knight
buried
by
a
Pope?
A
knight
whose
funeral
was
presided
over
by
a
Pope?"
Teabing
laughed
loudly.
"Oh,
that's
rich.
Always
the
optimist,
Robert.
Look
at
the
second
line.
This
knight
obviously
did
something
that
incurred
the
Holy
wrath
of
the
Church.
Think
again.
Consider
the
dynamic
between
the
Church
and
the
Knights
Templar.
A
knight
a
Pope
interred?"
"A
knight
a
Pope
killed?"
Sophie
asked.
Teabing
smiled
and
patted
her
knee.
"Well
done,
my
dear.
A
knight
a
Pope
buried.
Or
killed."
Langdon
thought
of
the
notorious
Templar
round
up
in
1307
unlucky
Friday
the
thirteenth
when
Pope
Clement
killed
and
interred
hundreds
of
Knights
Templar.
"But
there
must
be
endless
graves
of
'knights
killed
by
Popes.'
"Aha,
not
so!
"Teabing
said.
"Many
of
them
were
burned
at
the
stake
