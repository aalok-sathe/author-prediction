Abu
Yusuf
Ismail
al
Kindi
protected
his
secrets
with
an
ingeniously
conceived
polyalphabetic
substitution
cipher.
Da
Vinci,
however,
eschewed
mathematics
and
cryptology
for
a
mechanical
solution.
The
cryptex.
A
portable
container
that
could
safeguard
letters,
maps,
diagrams,
anything
at
all.
Once
information
was
sealed
inside
the
cryptex,
only
the
individual
with
the
proper
password
could
access
it.
"We
require
a
password,"
Sophie
said,
pointing
out
the
lettered
dials.
"A
cryptex
works
much
like
a
bicycle's
combination
lock.
If
you
align
the
dials
in
the
proper
position,
the
lock
slides
open.
This
cryptex
has
five
lettered
dials.
When
you
rotate
them
to
their
proper
sequence,
the
tumblers
inside
align,
and
the
entire
cylinder
slides
apart."
"And
inside?"
"Once
the
cylinder
slides
apart,
you
have
access
to
a
hollow
central
compartment,
which
can
hold
a
scroll
of
paper
on
which
is
the
information
you
want
to
keep
private."
Langdon
looked
incredulous.
"And
you
say
your
grandfather
built
these
for
you
when
you
were
younger?"
"Some
smaller
ones,
yes.
A
couple
times
for
my
birthday,
he
gave
me
a
cryptex
and
told
me
a
riddle.
The
answer
to
the
riddle
was
the
password
to
the
cryptex,
and
once
I
figured
it
out,
I
could
open
it
up
and
find
my
birthday
card."
"A
lot
of
work
for
a
card."
"No,
the
cards
always
contained
another
riddle
or
clue.
My
grandfather
loved
creating
elaborate
treasure
hunts
around
our
house,
a
string
of
clues
that
eventually
led
to
my
real
gift.
Each
treasure
hunt
was
a
test
of
character
and
merit,
to
ensure
I
earned
my
rewards.
And
the
tests
were
never
simple."
Langdon
eyed
the
device
again,
still
looking
skeptical.
"But
why
not
just
pry
it
apart?
Or
smash
it?
The
metal
looks
delicate,
and
marble
is
a
soft
rock.
Sophie
smiled.
"Because
Da
Vinci
is
too
smart
for
that.
He
designed
the
cryptex
so
that
if
you
try
to
force
it
open
in
any
way,
the
information
self
destructs.
Watch."
Sophie
reached
into
the
box
and
carefully
lifted
out
the
cylinder.
"Any
information
to
be
inserted
is
first
written
on
a
papyrus
scroll."
"Not
vellum?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Papyrus.
I
know
sheep's
vellum
was
more
durable
and
more
common
in
those
days,
but
it
had
to
be
papyrus.
The
thinner
the
better."
"Okay."
"Before
the
papyrus
was
inserted
into
the
cryptex's
compartment,
it
was
rolled
around
a
delicate
glass
vial."
She
tipped
the
cryptex,
and
the
liquid
inside
gurgled.
"A
vial
of
liquid."
"Liquid
what?"
Sophie
smiled.
"Vinegar."
Langdon
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
began
nodding.
"Brilliant."
Vinegar
and
papyrus,
Sophie
thought.
If
someone
attempted
to
force
open
the
cryptex,
the
glass
vial
would
break,
and
the
vinegar
would
quickly
dissolve
the
papyrus.
By
the
time
anyone
extracted
the
secret
message,
it
would
be
a
glob
of
meaningless
pulp.
"As
you
can
see,"
Sophie
told
him,
"the
only
way
to
access
the
information
inside
is
to
know
the
proper
five
letter
password.
And
with
five
dials,
each
with
twenty
six
letters,
that's
