studied
the
strange
text.
t&amp;%&amp;V7C0dM&amp;
After
several
seconds,
he
began
to
feel
the
initial
frustration
resurfacing.
"Leigh,
I
just
can't
seem
to
place
it.
From
where
Sophie
was
seated
across
the
table,
she
could
not
yet
see
the
text,
but
Langdon's
inability
to
immediately
identify
the
language
surprised
her.
My
grandfather
spoke
a
language
so
obscure
that
even
a
symbologist
can't
identify
it?
She
quickly
realized
she
should
not
find
this
surprising.
This
would
not
be
the
first
secret
Jacques
Sauniere
had
kept
from
his
granddaughter.
Opposite
Sophie,
Leigh
Teabing
felt
ready
to
burst.
Eager
for
his
chance
to
see
the
text,
he
quivered
with
excitement,
leaning
in,
trying
to
see
around
Langdon,
who
was
still
hunched
over
the
box.
"I
don't
know,"
Langdon
whispered
intently.
"My
first
guess
is
a
Semitic,
but
now
I'm
not
so
sure.
Most
primary
Semitics
include
nekkudot.
This
has
none."
"Probably
ancient,"
Teabing
offered.
"Nekkudot?"
Sophie
inquired.
Teabing
never
took
his
eyes
from
the
box.
"Most
modern
Semitic
alphabets
have
no
vowels
and
use
nekkudot
tiny
dots
and
dashes
written
either
below
or
within
the
consonants
to
indicate
what
vowel
sound
accompanies
them.
Historically
speaking,
nekkudot
are
a
relatively
modern
addition
to
language."
Langdon
was
still
hovering
over
the
script.
"A
Sephardic
transliteration,
perhaps?"
Teabing
could
bear
it
no
longer.
"Perhaps
if
I
just"
Reaching
over,
he
edged
the
box
away
from
Langdon
and
pulled
it
toward
himself.
No
doubt
Langdon
had
a
solid
familiarity
with
the
standard
ancients
Greek,
Latin,
the
Romances
but
from
the
fleeting
glance
Teabing
had
of
this
language,
he
thought
it
looked
more
specialized,
possibly
a
Rashi
script
or
a
STA'M
with
crowns.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
Teabing
feasted
his
eyes
upon
the
engraving.
He
said
nothing
for
a
very
long
time.
With
each
passing
second,
Teabing
felt
his
confidence
deflating.
"I'm
astonished,"
he
said.
"This
language
looks
like
nothing
I've
ever
seen!"
Langdon
slumped.
"Might
I
see
it?"
Sophie
asked.
Teabing
pretended
not
to
hear
her.
"Robert,
you
said
earlier
that
you
thought
you'd
seen
something
like
this
before?"
Langdon
looked
vexed.
"I
thought
so.
I'm
not
sure.
The
script
looks
familiar
somehow."
"Leigh?"
Sophie
repeated,
clearly
not
appreciating
being
left
out
of
the
discussion.
"Might
I
have
a
look
at
the
box
my
grandfather
made?"
"Of
course,
dear,"
Teabing
said,
pushing
it
over
to
her.
He
hadn't
meant
to
sound
belittling,
and
yet
Sophie
Neveu
was
light
years
out
of
her
league.
If
a
British
Royal
Historian
and
a
Harvard
symbologist
could
not
even
identify
the
language
"Aah,"
Sophie
said,
seconds
after
examining
the
box.
"I
should
have
guessed."
Teabing
and
Langdon
turned
in
unison,
staring
at
her.
"Guessed
what?"
Teabing
demanded.
Sophie
shrugged.
"Guessed
that
this
would
be
the
language
my
grandfather
would
have
used."
"You're
saying
you
can
read
this
text?"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"Quite
easily,"
Sophie
chimed,
obviously
enjoying
herself
now.
"My
grandfather
taught
me
this
language
when
I
was
only
six
years
old.
I'm
fluent."
She
leaned
across
the
table
and
fixed
Teabing
with
