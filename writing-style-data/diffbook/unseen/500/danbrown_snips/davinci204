stared
at
the
chief
inspector
a
long
moment,
and
then
burst
out
laughing.
"Is
this
one
of
those
hidden
camera
programs?
Jolly
good!"
The
chief
inspector
never
flinched.
"This
is
serious,
sir.
The
French
police
claim
you
also
may
have
a
hostage
onboard."
Teabing's
manservant
Remy
appeared
in
the
doorway
at
the
top
of
the
stairs.
"I
feel
like
a
hostage
working
for
Sir
Leigh,
but
he
assures
me
I
am
free
to
go."
Remy
checked
his
watch.
"Master,
we
really
are
running
late."
He
nodded
toward
the
Jaguar
stretch
limousine
in
the
far
corner
of
the
hangar.
The
enormous
automobile
was
ebony
with
smoked
glass
and
whitewall
tires.
"I'll
bring
the
car."
Remy
started
down
the
stairs.
"I'm
afraid
we
cannot
let
you
leave,"
the
chief
inspector
said.
"Please
return
to
your
aircraft.
Both
of
you.
Representatives
from
the
French
police
will
be
landing
shortly."
Teabing
looked
now
toward
Simon
Edwards.
"Simon,
for
heaven's
sake,
this
is
ridiculous!
We
don't
have
anyone
else
on
board.
Just
the
usual
Remy,
our
pilot,
and
myself.
Perhaps
you
could
act
as
an
intermediary?
Go
have
a
look
onboard,
and
verify
that
the
plane
is
empty."
Edwards
knew
he
was
trapped.
"Yes,
sir.
I
can
have
a
look."
"The
devil
you
will!"
the
Kent
chief
inspector
declared,
apparently
knowing
enough
about
executive
airfields
to
suspect
Simon
Edwards
might
well
lie
about
the
plane's
occupants
in
an
effort
to
keep
Teabing's
business
at
Biggin
Hill.
"I
will
look
myself."
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"No
you
won't,
Inspector.
This
is
private
property
and
until
you
have
a
search
warrant,
you
will
stay
off
my
plane.
I
am
offering
you
a
reasonable
option
here.
Mr.
Edwards
can
perform
the
inspection."
"No
deal."
Teabing's
demeanor
turned
frosty.
"Inspector,
I'm
afraid
I
don't
have
time
to
indulge
in
your
games.
I'm
late,
and
I'm
leaving.
If
it
is
that
important
to
you
to
stop
me,
you'll
just
have
to
shoot
me."
With
that,
Teabing
and
Remy
walked
around
the
chief
inspector
and
headed
across
the
hangar
toward
the
parked
limousine.
The
Kent
chief
inspector
felt
only
distaste
for
Leigh
Teabing
as
the
man
hobbled
around
him
in
defiance.
Men
of
privilege
always
felt
like
they
were
above
the
law.
They
are
not.
The
chief
inspector
turned
and
aimed
at
Teabing's
back.
"Stop!
I
will
fire!"
"Go
ahead,"
Teabing
said
without
breaking
stride
or
glancing
back.
"My
lawyers
will
fricassee
your
testicles
for
breakfast.
And
if
you
dare
board
my
plane
without
a
warrant,
your
spleen
will
follow."
No
stranger
to
power
plays,
the
chief
inspector
was
unimpressed.
Technically,
Teabing
was
correct
and
the
police
needed
a
warrant
to
board
his
jet,
but
because
the
flight
had
originated
in
France,
and
because
the
powerful
Bezu
Fache
had
given
his
authority,
the
Kent
chief
inspector
felt
certain
his
career
would
be
far
better
served
by
finding
out
what
it
was
on
this
plane
that
Teabing
seemed
so
intent
on
hiding.
"Stop
them,"
the
inspector
ordered.
"I'm
searching
the
plane."
His
