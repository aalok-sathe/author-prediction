surprising
we
feel
conflicted
about
sex?"
he
asked
his
students.
"Our
ancient
heritage
and
our
very
physiologies
tell
us
sex
is
natural
a
cherished
route
to
spiritual
fulfillment
and
yet
modern
religion
decries
it
as
shameful,
teaching
us
to
fear
our
sexual
desire
as
the
hand
of
the
devil."
Langdon
decided
not
to
shock
his
students
with
the
fact
that
more
than
a
dozen
secret
societies
around
the
world
many
of
them
quite
influential
still
practiced
sex
rites
and
kept
the
ancient
traditions
alive.
Tom
Cruise's
character
in
the
film
Eyes
Wide
Shut
discovered
this
the
hard
way
when
he
sneaked
into
a
private
gathering
of
ultraelite
Manhattanites
only
to
find
himself
witnessing
Hieros
Gamos.
Sadly,
the
filmmakers
had
gotten
most
of
the
specifics
wrong,
but
the
basic
gist
was
there
a
secret
society
communing
to
celebrate
the
magic
of
sexual
union.
"Professor
Langdon?"
A
male
student
in
back
raised
his
hand,
sounding
hopeful.
"Are
you
saying
that
instead
of
going
to
chapel,
we
should
have
more
sex?"
Langdon
chuckled,
not
about
to
take
the
bait.
From
what
he'd
heard
about
Harvard
parties,
these
kids
were
having
more
than
enough
sex.
"Gentlemen,"
he
said,
knowing
he
was
on
tender
ground,
"might
I
offer
a
suggestion
for
all
of
you.
Without
being
so
bold
as
to
condone
premarital
sex,
and
without
being
so
naive
as
to
think
you're
all
chaste
angels,
I
will
give
you
this
bit
of
advice
about
your
sex
lives."
All
the
men
in
the
audience
leaned
forward,
listening
intently.
"The
next
time
you
find
yourself
with
a
woman,
look
in
your
heart
and
see
if
you
cannot
approach
sex
as
a
mystical,
spiritual
act.
Challenge
yourself
to
find
that
spark
of
divinity
that
man
can
only
achieve
through
union
with
the
sacred
feminine."
The
women
smiled
knowingly,
nodding.
The
men
exchanged
dubious
giggles
and
off
color
jokes.
Langdon
sighed.
College
men
were
still
boys.
Sophie's
forehead
felt
cold
as
she
pressed
it
against
the
plane's
window
and
stared
blankly
into
the
void,
trying
to
process
what
Langdon
had
just
told
her.
She
felt
a
new
regret
well
within
her.
Ten
years.
She
pictured
the
stacks
of
unopened
letters
her
grandfather
had
sent
her.
will
tell
Robert
everything.
Without
turning
from
the
window,
Sophie
began
to
speak.
Quietly.
Fearfully.
As
she
began
to
recount
what
had
happened
that
night,
she
felt
herself
drifting
back
alighting
in
the
woods
outside
her
grandfather's
Normandy
chateau
searching
the
deserted
house
in
confusion
hearing
the
voices
below
her
and
then
finding
the
hidden
door.
She
inched
down
the
stone
staircase,
one
step
at
a
time,
into
that
basement
grotto.
She
could
taste
the
earthy
air.
Cool
and
light.
It
was
March.
In
the
shadows
of
her
hiding
place
on
the
staircase,
she
watched
as
the
strangers
swayed
and
chanted
by
flickering
orange
candles.
I'm
dreaming,
Sophie
told
herself.
This
is
a
dream.
What
else
could
this
be?
The
women
and
men
were
staggered,
black,
white,
black,
white.
The
women's
beautiful
gossamer
gowns
