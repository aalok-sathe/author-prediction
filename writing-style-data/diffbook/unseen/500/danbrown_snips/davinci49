treatment
for
having
a
famous
grandfather."
No
wonder
she
was
upset
by
the
pictures.
Collet
could
barely
conceive
of
the
unfortunate
coincidence
that
called
in
a
young
woman
to
decipher
a
code
written
by
a
dead
family
member.
Still,
her
actions
made
no
sense.
"But
she
obviously
recognized
the
numbers
as
Fibonacci
numbers
because
she
came
here
and
told
us.
I
don't
understand
why
she
would
leave
the
office
without
telling
anyone
she
had
figured
it
out."
Collet
could
think
of
only
one
scenario
to
explain
the
troubling
developments:
Sauniere
had
written
a
numeric
code
on
the
floor
in
hopes
Fache
would
involve
cryptographers
in
the
investigation,
and
therefore
involve
his
own
granddaughter.
As
for
the
rest
of
the
message,
was
Sauniere
communicating
in
some
way
with
his
granddaughter?
If
so,
what
did
the
message
tell
her?
And
how
did
Langdon
fit
in?
Before
Collet
could
ponder
it
any
further,
the
silence
of
the
deserted
museum
was
shattered
by
an
alarm.
The
bell
sounded
like
it
was
coming
from
inside
the
Grand
Gallery.
"Alarme!
"
one
of
the
agents
yelled,
eyeing
his
feed
from
the
Louvre
security
center.
"Grande
Galerie!
Toilettes
Messieurs!
Fache
wheeled
to
Collet.
"Where's
Langdon?"
"Still
in
the
men's
room!"
Collet
pointed
to
the
blinking
red
dot
on
his
laptop
schematic.
"He
must
have
broken
the
window
!
"
Collet
knew
Langdon
wouldn't
get
far.
Although
Paris
fire
codes
required
windows
above
fifteen
meters
in
public
buildings
be
breakable
in
case
of
fire,
exiting
a
Louvre
second
story
window
without
the
help
of
a
hook
and
ladder
would
be
suicide.
Furthermore,
there
were
no
trees
or
grass
on
the
western
end
of
the
Denon
Wing
to
cushion
a
fall.
Directly
beneath
that
rest
room
window,
the
two
lane
Place
du
Carrousel
ran
within
a
few
feet
of
the
outer
wall.
"My
God,"
Collet
exclaimed,
eyeing
the
screen.
"Langdon's
moving
to
the
window
ledge!"
But
Fache
was
already
in
motion.
Yanking
his
Manurhin
MR
93
revolver
from
his
shoulder
holster,
the
captain
dashed
out
of
the
office.
Collet
watched
the
screen
in
bewilderment
as
the
blinking
dot
arrived
at
the
window
ledge
and
then
did
something
utterly
unexpected.
The
dot
moved
outside
the
perimeter
of
the
building.
What's
going
on?
he
wondered.
Is
Langdon
out
on
a
ledge
or
"Jesuf"
Collet
jumped
to
his
feet
as
the
dot
shot
farther
outside
the
wall.
The
signal
seemed
to
shudder
for
a
moment,
and
then
the
blinking
dot
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
about
ten
yards
outside
the
perimeter
of
the
building.
Fumbling
with
the
controls,
Collet
called
up
a
Paris
street
map
and
recalibrated
the
GPS.
Zooming
in,
he
could
now
see
the
exact
location
of
the
signal.
It
was
no
longer
moving.
It
lay
at
a
dead
stop
in
the
middle
of
Place
du
Carrousel.
Langdon
had
jumped.
Fache
sprinted
down
the
Grand
Gallery
as
Collet's
radio
blared
over
the
distant
sound
of
the
alarm.
"He
jumped!"
Collet
was
yelling.
"I'm
showing
the
signal
out
on
Place
du
