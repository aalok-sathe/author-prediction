tomb
might
relate
to
information
he
had
gained
within
the
Vatican.
Gettum
had
been
a
librarian
long
enough
to
know
the
most
common
reason
people
came
to
London
to
look
for
knights.
The
Grail.
Gettum
smiled
and
adjusted
her
glasses.
"You
are
friends
with
Leigh
Teabing,
you
are
in
England,
and
you
are
looking
for
a
knight."
She
folded
her
hands.
"I
can
only
assume
you
are
on
a
Grail
quest."
Langdon
and
Sophie
exchanged
startled
looks.
Gettum
laughed.
"My
friends,
this
library
is
a
base
camp
for
Grail
seekers.
Leigh
Teabing
among
them.
I
wish
I
had
a
shilling
for
every
time
I'd
run
searches
for
the
Rose,
Mary
Magdalene,
Sangreal,
Merovingian,
Priory
of
Sion,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
Everyone
loves
a
conspiracy."
She
took
off
her
glasses
and
eyed
them.
"I
need
more
information."
In
the
silence,
Gettum
sensed
her
guests'
desire
for
discretion
was
quickly
being
outweighed
by
their
eagerness
for
a
fast
result.
"Here,"
Sophie
Neveu
blurted.
"This
is
everything
we
know."
Borrowing
a
pen
from
Langdon,
she
wrote
two
more
lines
on
the
slip
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
Gettum.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Gettum
gave
an
inward
smile.
The
Grail
indeed,
she
thought,
noting
the
references
to
the
Rose
and
her
seeded
womb.
"I
can
help
you,"
she
said,
looking
up
from
the
slip
of
paper.
"Might
I
ask
where
this
verse
came
from?
And
why
you
are
seeking
an
orb?"
"You
might
ask,"
Langdon
said,
with
a
friendly
smile,
"but
it's
a
long
story
and
we
have
very
little
time."
"Sounds
like
a
polite
way
of
saying
'mind
your
own
business.'
"We
would
be
forever
in
your
debt,
Pamela,"
Langdon
said,
"if
you
could
find
out
who
this
knight
is
and
where
he
is
buried."
"Very
well,"
Gettum
said,
typing
again.
"I'll
play
along.
If
this
is
a
Grail
related
issue,
we
should
cross
reference
against
Grail
keywords.
I'll
add
a
proximity
parameter
and
remove
the
title
weighting.
That
will
limit
our
hits
only
to
those
instances
of
textual
keywords
that
occur
near
a
Grail
related
word."

"How
long
will
this
take?"
Sophie
asked.
"A
few
hundred
terabytes
with
multiple
cross
referencing
fields?"
Gettum's
eyes
glimmered
as
she
clicked
the
SEARCH
key.
"A
mere
fifteen
minutes."
Langdon
and
Sophie
said
nothing,
but
Gettum
sensed
this
sounded
like
an
eternity
to
them.
"Tea?"
Gettum
asked,
standing
and
walking
toward
the
pot
she
had
made
earlier.
"Leigh
always
loves
my
tea.
London's
Opus
Dei
Centre
is
a
modest
brick
building
at
5
Orme
Court,
overlooking
the
North
Walk
at
Kensington
Gardens.
Silas
had
never
been
here,
but
he
felt
a
rising
sense
of
refuge
and
asylum
as
he
approached
the
building
on
foot.
Despite
the
rain,
Remy
had
dropped
him
off
a
short
distance
away
in
order
to
keep
the
limousine
off
the
main
streets.
