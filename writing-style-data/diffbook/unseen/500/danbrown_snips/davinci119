anywhere
near
the
clients.
You
need
to
go
in
and
ask
the
front
desk."
"Your
bank
is
demanding
a
search
warrant
before
we
can
enter."
Vernet
put
on
a
disgusted
look.
"Administrators.
Don't
get
me
started."
"Open
your
truck,
please."
Collet
motioned
toward
the
cargo
hold.
Vernet
stared
at
the
agent
and
forced
an
obnoxious
laugh.
"Open
the
truck?
You
think
I
have
keys?
You
think
they
trust
us?
You
should
see
the
crap
wages
I
get
paid."
The
agent's
head
tilted
to
one
side,
his
skepticism
evident.
"You're
telling
me
you
don't
have
keys
to
your
own
truck?"
Vernet
shook
his
head.
"Not
the
cargo
area.
Ignition
only.
These
trucks
get
sealed
by
overseers
on
the
loading
dock.
Then
the
truck
sits
in
dock
while
someone
drives
the
cargo
keys
to
the
drop
off.
Once
we
get
the
call
that
the
cargo
keys
are
with
the
recipient,
then
I
get
the
okay
to
drive.
Not
a
second
before.
I
never
know
what
the
hell
I'm
lugging."
"When
was
this
truck
sealed?"
"Must
have
been
hours
ago.
I'm
driving
all
the
way
up
to
St.
Thurial
tonight.
Cargo
keys
are
already
up
there."
The
agent
made
no
response,
his
eyes
probing
as
if
trying
to
read
Vernet's
mind.
A
drop
of
sweat
was
preparing
to
slide
down
Vernet's
nose.
"You
mind?"
he
said,
wiping
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
and
motioning
to
the
police
car
blocking
his
way.
"I'm
on
a
tight
schedule."
"Do
all
the
drivers
wear
Rolexes?"
the
agent
asked,
pointing
to
Vernet's
wrist.
Vernet
glanced
down
and
saw
the
glistening
band
of
his
absurdly
expensive
watch
peeking
out
from
beneath
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket.
Merde.
"This
piece
of
shit?
Bought
it
for
twenty
euro
from
a
Taiwanese
street
vendor
in
St.
Germain
des
Pres.
I'll
sell
it
to
you
for
forty."
The
agent
paused
and
finally
stepped
aside.
"No
thanks.
Have
a
safe
trip."
Vernet
did
not
breathe
again
until
the
truck
was
a
good
fifty
meters
down
the
street.
And
now
he
had
another
problem.
His
cargo.
Where
do
I
take
them?
Silas
lay
prone
on
the
canvas
mat
in
his
room,
allowing
the
lash
wounds
on
his
back
to
clot
in
the
air.
Tonight's
second
session
with
the
Discipline
had
left
him
dizzy
and
weak.
He
had
yet
to
remove
the
cilice
belt,
and
he
could
feel
the
blood
trickling
down
his
inner
thigh.
Still,
he
could
not
justify
removing
the
strap.
have
failed
the
Church.
Far
worse,
I
have
failed
the
bishop.
Tonight
was
supposed
to
be
Bishop
Aringarosa's
salvation.
Five
months
ago,
the
bishop
had
returned
from
a
meeting
at
the
Vatican
Observatory,
where
he
had
learned
something
that
left
him
deeply
changed.
Depressed
for
weeks,
Aringarosa
had
finally
shared
the
news
with
Silas.
"But
this
is
impossible!"
Silas
had
cried
out.
"I
cannot
accept
it!"
"It
is
true,"
Aringarosa
said.
"Unthinkable,
but
true.
In
only
six
months."
The
bishop's
words
terrified
Silas.
He
prayed
for
deliverance,
and
even
in
those
dark
