by
Templars.
The
cola
was
warm.
The
dissolving
veil
of
night
seemed
to
evaporate
quickly,
and
as
Langdon
watched
the
transformation,
he
saw
a
shimmering
ocean
stretch
out
beneath
them.
The
English
Channel.
It
wouldn't
be
long
now.
Langdon
willed
the
light
of
day
to
bring
with
it
a
second
kind
of
illumination,
but
the
lighter
it
became
outside,
the
further
he
felt
from
the
truth.
He
heard
the
rhythms
of
iambic
pentameter
and
chanting,
Hieros
Gamos
and
sacred
rites,
resonating
with
the
rumble
of
the
jet.
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars.
The
plane
was
over
land
again
when
a
flash
of
enlightenment
struck
him.
Langdon
set
down
his
empty
can
of
Coke
hard.
"You
won't
believe
this,"
he
said,
turning
to
the
others.
"The
Templar
headstone
I
figured
it
out."
Teabing's
eyes
turned
to
saucers.
"You
know
where
the
headstone
is?"
Langdon
smiled.
"Not
where
it
is.
What
it
is."
Sophie
leaned
in
to
hear.
"I
think
the
headstone
references
a
literal
stone
head,
"
Langdon
explained,
savoring
the
familiar
excitement
of
academic
breakthrough.
"Not
a
grave
marker."
"A
stone
head?"
Teabing
demanded.
Sophie
looked
equally
confused.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
turning,
"during
the
Inquisition,
the
Church
accused
the
Knights
Templar
of
all
kinds
of
heresies,
right?"
"Correct.
They
fabricated
all
kinds
of
charges.
Sodomy,
urination
on
the
cross,
devil
worship,
quite
a
list."
"And
on
that
list
was
the
worship
of
false
idols,
right?
Specifically,
the
Church
accused
the
Templars
of
secretly
performing
rituals
in
which
they
prayed
to
a
carved
stone
head
the
pagan
god
"Baphomet!"
Teabing
blurted.
"My
heavens,
Robert,
you're
right!
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars!"
Langdon
quickly
explained
to
Sophie
that
Baphomet
was
a
pagan
fertility
god
associated
with
the
creative
force
of
reproduction.
Baphomet's
head
was
represented
as
that
of
a
ram
or
goat,
a
common
symbol
of
procreation
and
fecundity.
The
Templars
honored
Baphomet
by
encircling
a
stone
replica
of
his
head
and
chanting
prayers.
"Baphomet,"
Teabing
tittered.
"The
ceremony
honored
the
creative
magic
of
sexual
union,
but
Pope
Clement
convinced
everyone
that
Baphomet's
head
was
in
fact
that
of
the
devil.
The
Pope
used
the
head
of
Baphomet
as
the
linchpin
in
his
case
against
the
Templars."
Langdon
concurred.
The
modern
belief
in
a
homed
devil
known
as
Satan
could
be
traced
back
to
Baphomet
and
the
Church's
attempts
to
recast
the
horned
fertility
god
as
a
symbol
of
evil.
The
Church
had
obviously
succeeded,
although
not
entirely.
Traditional
American
Thanksgiving
tables
still
bore
pagan,
horned
fertility
symbols.
The
cornucopia
or
"horn
of
plenty"
was
a
tribute
to
Baphomet's
fertility
and
dated
back
to
Zeus
being
suckled
by
a
goat
whose
horn
broke
off
and
magically
filled
with
fruit.
Baphomet
also
appeared
in
group
photographs
when
some
joker
raised
two
fingers
behind
a
friend's
head
in
the
V
symbol
of
horns;
certainly
few
of
the
pranksters
realized
their
mocking
gesture
was
in
fact
advertising
their
victim's
robust
sperm
count.
"Yes,
yes,"
Teabing
was
saying
excitedly.
"Baphomet
must
be
what
the
poem
is
