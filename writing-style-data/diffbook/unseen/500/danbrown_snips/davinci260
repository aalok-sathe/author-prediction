fool!
The
secret
is
lost!
Teabing
felt
himself
sobbing
uncontrollably.
The
Grail
is
gone.
Everything
destroyed.
Shuddering
in
disbelief
over
Langdon's
actions,
Teabing
tried
to
force
the
cylinder
apart,
longing
to
catch
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
history
before
it
dissolved
forever.
To
his
shock,
as
he
pulled
the
ends
of
the
keystone,
the
cylinder
separated.
He
gasped
and
peered
inside.
It
was
empty
except
for
shards
of
wet
glass.
No
dissolving
papyrus.
Teabing
rolled
over
and
looked
up
at
Langdon.
Sophie
stood
beside
him,
aiming
the
gun
down
at
Teabing.
Bewildered,
Teabing
looked
back
at
the
keystone
and
saw
it.
The
dials
were
no
longer
at
random.
They
spelled
a
five
letter
word:
APPLE.
"The
orb
from
which
Eve
partook,"
Langdon
said
coolly,
"incurring
the
Holy
wrath
of
God.
Original
sin.
The
symbol
of
the
fall
of
the
sacred
feminine."
Teabing
felt
the
truth
come
crashing
down
on
him
in
excruciating
austerity.
The
orb
that
ought
be
on
Newton's
tomb
could
be
none
other
than
the
Rosy
apple
that
fell
from
heaven,
struck
Newton
on
the
head,
and
inspired
his
life's
work.
His
labor's
fruit!
The
Rosy
flesh
with
a
seeded
womb!
"Robert,"
Teabing
stammered,
overwhelmed.
"You
opened
it.
Where
is
the
map?"
Without
blinking,
Langdon
reached
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat
and
carefully
extracted
a
delicate
rolled
papyrus.
Only
a
few
yards
from
where
Teabing
lay,
Langdon
unrolled
the
scroll
and
looked
at
it.
After
a
long
moment,
a
knowing
smile
crossed
Langdon's
face.
He
knows!
Teabing's
heart
craved
that
knowledge.
His
life's
dream
was
right
in
front
of
him.
"Tell
me!"
Teabing
demanded.
"Please!
Oh
God,
please!
It's
not
too
late!"
As
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
thundered
down
the
hall
toward
the
Chapter
House,
Langdon
quietly
rolled
the
papyrus
and
slipped
it
back
in
his
pocket.
"No!"
Teabing
cried
out,
trying
in
vain
to
stand.
When
the
doors
burst
open,
Bezu
Fache
entered
like
a
bull
into
a
ring,
his
feral
eyes
scanning,
finding
his
target
Leigh
Teabing
helpless
on
the
floor.
Exhaling
in
relief,
Fache
holstered
his
Manurhin
sidearm
and
turned
to
Sophie.
"Agent
Neveu,
I
am
relieved
you
and
Mr.
Langdon
are
safe.
You
should
have
come
in
when
I
asked."
The
British
police
entered
on
Fache's
heels,
seizing
the
anguished
prisoner
and
placing
him
in
handcuffs.
Sophie
seemed
stunned
to
see
Fache.
"How
did
you
find
us?"
Fache
pointed
to
Teabing.
"He
made
the
mistake
of
showing
his
ID
when
he
entered
the
abbey.
The
guards
heard
a
police
broadcast
about
our
search
for
him."
"It's
in
Langdon's
pocket!"
Teabing
was
screaming
like
a
madman.
"The
map
to
the
Holy
Grail!"
As
they
hoisted
Teabing
and
carried
him
out,
he
threw
back
his
head
and
howled.
"Robert!
Tell
me
where
it's
hidden!"
As
Teabing
passed,
Langdon
looked
him
in
the
eye.
"Only
the
worthy
find
the
Grail,
Leigh.
You
taught
me
that.
The
mist
had
settled
low
on
Kensington
Gardens
as
Silas
limped
into
a
quiet
hollow
out
of
sight.
Kneeling
