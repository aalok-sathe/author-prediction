have
double
meanings,
and
yet
Langdon
could
see
no
further.
Marie
gave
a
tired
yawn.
"Mr.
Langdon,
I
will
make
a
confession
to
you.
I
have
never
officially
been
privy
to
the
present
location
of
the
Grail.
But,
of
course,
I
was
married
to
a
person
of
enormous
influence
and
my
women's
intuition
is
strong."
Langdon
started
to
speak
but
Marie
continued.
"I
am
sorry
that
after
all
your
hard
work,
you
will
be
leaving
Rosslyn
without
any
real
answers.
And
yet,
something
tells
me
you
will
eventually
find
what
you
seek.
One
day
it
will
dawn
on
you."
She
smiled.
"And
when
it
does,
I
trust
that
you,
of
all
people,
can
keep
a
secret."
There
was
a
sound
of
someone
arriving
in
the
doorway.
"Both
of
you
disappeared,"
Sophie
said,
entering.
"I
was
just
leaving,"
her
grandmother
replied,
walking
over
to
Sophie
at
the
door.
"Good
night,
princess."
She
kissed
Sophie's
forehead.
"Don't
keep
Mr.
Langdon
out
too
late."
Langdon
and
Sophie
watched
her
grandmother
walk
back
toward
the
fieldstone
house.
When
Sophie
turned
to
him,
her
eyes
were
awash
in
deep
emotion.
"Not
exactly
the
ending
I
expected."
That
makes
two
of
us,
he
thought.
Langdon
could
see
she
was
overwhelmed.
The
news
she
had
received
tonight
had
changed
everything
in
her
life.
"Are
you
okay?
It's
a
lot
to
take
in."
She
smiled
quietly.
"I
have
a
family.
That's
where
I'm
going
to
start.
Who
we
are
and
where
we
came
from
will
take
some
time."
Langdon
remained
silent.
"Beyond
tonight,
will
you
stay
with
us?"
Sophie
asked.
"At
least
for
a
few
days?"
Langdon
sighed,
wanting
nothing
more.
"You
need
some
time
here
with
your
family,
Sophie.
I'm
going
back
to
Paris
in
the
morning."
She
looked
disappointed
but
seemed
to
know
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
Neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
long
time.
Finally
Sophie
reached
over
and,
taking
his
hand,
led
him
out
of
the
chapel.
They
walked
to
a
small
rise
on
the
bluff.
From
here,
the
Scottish
countryside
spread
out
before
them,
suffused
in
a
pale
moonlight
that
sifted
through
the
departing
clouds.
They
stood
in
silence,
holding
hands,
both
of
them
fighting
the
descending
shroud
of
exhaustion.
The
stars
were
just
now
appearing,
but
to
the
east,
a
single
point
of
light
glowed
brighter
than
any
other.
Langdon
smiled
when
he
saw
it.
It
was
Venus.
The
ancient
Goddess
shining
down
with
her
steady
and
patient
light.
The
night
was
growing
cooler,
a
crisp
breeze
rolling
up
from
the
lowlands.
After
a
while,
Langdon
looked
over
at
Sophie.
Her
eyes
were
closed,
her
lips
relaxed
in
a
contented
smile.
Langdon
could
feel
his
own
eyes
growing
heavy.
Reluctantly,
he
squeezed
her
hand.
"Sophie?"
Slowly,
she
opened
her
eyes
and
turned
to
him.
Her
face
was
beautiful
in
the
moonlight.
She
gave
him
a
sleepy
smile.
"Hi."
Langdon
felt
an
unexpected
sadness
to
realize
he
would
be
returning
to
Paris
without
her.
"I
may
be
gone
before
you
