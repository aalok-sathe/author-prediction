in
turning
them
away
than
in
letting
them
in.
After
all,
they
said
it
would
only
take
a
minute.
What
harm
could
it
do
?
When
the
altar
boy
stepped
aside
to
let
the
three
people
pass,
he
could
have
sworn
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wren
looked
just
as
bewildered
by
all
of
this
as
he
was.
Uncertain,
the
boy
returned
to
his
chores,
watching
them
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye.
Langdon
had
to
smile
as
the
threesome
moved
deeper
into
the
church.
"Leigh,"
he
whispered,
"you
lie
entirely
too
well."
Teabing's
eyes
twinkled.
"Oxford
Theatre
Club.
They
still
talk
of
my
Julius
Caesar.
I'm
certain
nobody
has
ever
performed
the
first
scene
of
Act
Three
with
more
dedication."
Langdon
glanced
over.
"I
thought
Caesar
was
dead
in
that
scene."
Teabing
smirked.
"Yes,
but
my
toga
tore
open
when
I
fell,
and
I
had
to
lie
on
stage
for
half
an
hour
with
my
todger
hanging
out.
Even
so,
I
never
moved
a
muscle.
I
was
brilliant,
I
tell
you."
Langdon
cringed.
Sorry
I
missed
it.
As
the
group
moved
through
the
rectangular
annex
toward
the
archway
leading
into
the
main
church,
Langdon
was
surprised
by
the
barren
austerity.
Although
the
altar
layout
resembled
that
of
a
linear
Christian
chapel,
the
furnishings
were
stark
and
cold,
bearing
none
of
the
traditional
ornamentation.
"Bleak,"
he
whispered.
Teabing
chuckled.
"Church
of
England.
Anglicans
drink
their
religion
straight.
Nothing
to
distract
from
their
misery."
Sophie
motioned
through
the
vast
opening
that
gave
way
to
the
circular
section
of
the
church.
"It
looks
like
a
fortress
in
there,"
she
whispered.
Langdon
agreed.
Even
from
here,
the
walls
looked
unusually
robust.
"The
Knights
Templar
were
warriors,"
Teabing
reminded,
the
sound
of
his
aluminum
crutches
echoing
in
this
reverberant
space.
"A
religio
military
society.
Their
churches
were
their
strongholds
and
their
banks."
"Banks?"
Sophie
asked,
glancing
at
Leigh.
"Heavens,
yes.
The
Templars
invented
the
concept
of
modern
banking.
For
European
nobility,
traveling
with
gold
was
perilous,
so
the
Templars
allowed
nobles
to
deposit
gold
in
their
nearest
Temple
Church
and
then
draw
it
from
any
other
Temple
Church
across
Europe.
All
they
needed
was
proper
documentation."
He
winked.
"And
a
small
commission.
They
were
the
original
ATMs."
Teabing
pointed
toward
a
stained
glass
window
where
the
breaking
sun
was
refracting
through
a
white
clad
knight
riding
a
rose
colored
horse.
"Alanus
Marcel,"
Teabing
said,
"Master
of
the
Temple
in
the
early
twelve
hundreds.
He
and
his
successors
actually
held
the
Parliamentary
chair
of
Primus
Baro
Angiae."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"First
Baron
of
the
Realm?"
Teabing
nodded.
"The
Master
of
the
Temple,
some
claim,
held
more
influence
than
the
king
himself.
"
As
they
arrived
outside
the
circular
chamber,
Teabing
shot
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
altar
boy,
who
was
vacuuming
in
the
distance.
"You
know,"
Teabing
whispered
to
Sophie,
"the
Holy
Grail
is
said
to
once
have
been
stored
in
this
church
overnight
while
the
Templars
moved
it
from
one
hiding
place
to
