of
what
you
intend
to
do
with
these
funds,
and
if
it
is
in
any
way
illegal"
"Considering
what
you
are
asking
of
me,"
Aringarosa
countered,
"what
I
do
with
this
money
is
not
your
concern.
There
was
a
long
silence.
They
know
I'm
right,
Aringarosa
thought.
"Now,
I
imagine
you
have
something
for
me
to
sign?"
They
all
jumped,
eagerly
pushing
the
paper
toward
him,
as
if
they
wished
he
would
simply
leave.
Aringarosa
eyed
the
sheet
before
him.
It
bore
the
papal
seal.
"This
is
identical
to
the
copy
you
sent
me?"
"Exactly."
Aringarosa
was
surprised
how
little
emotion
he
felt
as
he
signed
the
document.
The
three
men
present,
however,
seemed
to
sigh
in
relief.
"Thank
you,
Bishop,"
the
secretariat
said.
"Your
service
to
the
Church
will
never
be
forgotten."
Aringarosa
picked
up
the
briefcase,
sensing
promise
and
authority
in
its
weight.
The
four
men
looked
at
one
another
for
a
moment
as
if
there
were
something
more
to
say,
but
apparently
there
was
not.
Aringarosa
turned
and
headed
for
the
door.
"Bishop?"
one
of
the
cardinals
called
out
as
Aringarosa
reached
the
threshold.
Aringarosa
paused,
turning.
"Yes?"
"Where
will
you
go
from
here?"
Aringarosa
sensed
the
query
was
more
spiritual
than
geographical,
and
yet
he
had
no
intention
of
discussing
morality
at
this
hour.
"Paris,"
he
said,
and
walked
out
the
door.
The
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
was
a
twenty
four
hour
Geldschrank
bank
offering
the
full
modern
array
of
anonymous
services
in
the
tradition
of
the
Swiss
numbered
account.
Maintaining
offices
in
Zurich,
Kuala
Lumpur,
New
York,
and
Paris,
the
bank
had
expanded
its
services
in
recent
years
to
offer
anonymous
computer
source
code
escrow
services
and
faceless
digitized
backup.
The
bread
and
butter
of
its
operation
was
by
far
its
oldest
and
simplest
offering
the
anonyme
Lager
blind
drop
services,
otherwise
known
as
anonymous
safe
deposit
boxes.
Clients
wishing
to
store
anything
from
stock
certificates
to
valuable
paintings
could
deposit
their
belongings
anonymously,
through
a
series
of
high
tech
veils
of
privacy,
withdrawing
items
at
any
time,
also
in
total
anonymity.
As
Sophie
pulled
the
taxi
to
a
stop
in
front
of
their
destination,
Langdon
gazed
out
at
the
building's
uncompromising
architecture
and
sensed
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
was
a
firm
with
little
sense
of
humor.
The
building
was
a
windowless
rectangle
that
seemed
to
be
forged
entirely
of
dull
steel.
Resembling
an
enormous
metal
brick,
the
edifice
sat
back
from
the
road
with
a
fifteen
foot
tall,
neon,
equilateral
cross
glowing
over
its
facade.
Switzerland's
reputation
for
secrecy
in
banking
had
become
one
of
the
country's
most
lucrative
exports.
Facilities
like
this
had
become
controversial
in
the
art
community
because
they
provided
a
perfect
place
for
art
thieves
to
hide
stolen
goods,
for
years
if
necessary,
until
the
heat
was
off.
Because
deposits
were
protected
from
police
inspection
by
privacy
laws
and
were
attached
to
numbered
accounts
rather
than
people's
names,
thieves
could
rest
easily
knowing
their
stolen
goods
were
safe
and
