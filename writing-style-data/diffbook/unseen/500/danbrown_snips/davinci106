than
they
had
been
on
his
first
visit,
when
everything
was
ablaze.
The
night
of
stark
awakening.
Tonight,
these
men
sat
in
the
shadows,
as
if
they
were
somehow
ashamed
of
what
was
about
to
transpire.
Aringarosa
entered
slowly,
regally
even.
He
could
see
the
shapes
of
three
men
at
a
long
table
on
the
far
side
of
the
room.
The
silhouette
of
the
man
in
the
middle
was
immediately
recognizable
the
obese
Secretariat
Vaticana,
overlord
of
all
legal
matters
within
Vatican
City.
The
other
two
were
high
ranking
Italian
cardinals.
Aringarosa
crossed
the
library
toward
them.
"My
humble
apologies
for
the
hour.
We're
on
different
time
zones.
You
must
be
tired."
"Not
at
all,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
hands
folded
on
his
enormous
belly.
"We
are
grateful
you
have
come
so
far.
The
least
we
can
do
is
be
awake
to
meet
you.
Can
we
offer
you
some
coffee
or
refreshments?"
"I'd
prefer
we
don't
pretend
this
is
a
social
visit.
I
have
another
plane
to
catch.
Shall
we
get
to
business?"
"Of
course,"
the
secretariat
said.
"You
have
acted
more
quickly
than
we
imagined."
"Have
I?"
"You
still
have
a
month."
"You
made
your
concerns
known
five
months
ago,"
Aringarosa
said.
"Why
should
I
wait?"
"Indeed.
We
are
very
pleased
with
your
expediency."
Aringarosa's
eyes
traveled
the
length
of
the
long
table
to
a
large
black
briefcase.
"Is
that
what
I
requested?"
"It
is."
The
secretariat
sounded
uneasy.
"Although,
I
must
admit,
we
are
concerned
with
the
request.
It
seems
quite"
"Dangerous,"
one
of
the
cardinals
finished.
"Are
you
certain
we
cannot
wire
it
to
you
somewhere?
The
sum
is
exorbitant."
Freedom
is
expensive.
"I
have
no
concerns
for
my
own
safety.
God
is
with
me."
The
men
actually
looked
doubtful.
"The
funds
are
exactly
as
I
requested?"
The
secretariat
nodded.
"Large
denomination
bearer
bonds
drawn
on
the
Vatican
Bank.
Negotiable
as
cash
anywhere
in
the
world."
Aringarosa
walked
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
opened
the
briefcase.
Inside
were
two
thick
stacks
of
bonds,
each
embossed
with
the
Vatican
seal
and
the
title
PORTATORE,
making
the
bonds
redeemable
to
whoever
was
holding
them.
The
secretariat
looked
tense.
"I
must
say,
Bishop,
all
of
us
would
feel
less
apprehensive
if
these
funds
were
in
cash.
I
could
not
lift
that
much
cash,
Aringarosa
thought,
closing
the
case.
"Bonds
are
negotiable
as
cash.
You
said
so
yourself.
The
cardinals
exchanged
uneasy
looks,
and
finally
one
said,
"Yes,
but
these
bonds
are
traceable
directly
to
the
Vatican
Bank."
Aringarosa
smiled
inwardly.
That
was
precisely
the
reason
the
Teacher
suggested
Aringarosa
get
the
money
in
Vatican
Bank
bonds.
It
served
as
insurance.
We
are
all
in
this
together
now.
"This
is
a
perfectly
legal
transaction,"
Aringarosa
defended.
"Opus
Dei
is
a
personal
prelature
of
Vatican
City,
and
His
Holiness
can
disperse
monies
however
he
sees
fit.
No
law
has
been
broken
here."
"True,
and
yet"
The
secretariat
leaned
forward
and
his
chair
creaked
under
the
burden.
"We
have
no
knowledge
