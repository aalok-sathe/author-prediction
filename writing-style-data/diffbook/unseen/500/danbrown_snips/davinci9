off.
As
Langdon
stood
alone
and
watched
the
departing
taillights,
he
realized
he
could
easily
reconsider,
exit
the
courtyard,
grab
a
taxi,
and
head
home
to
bed.
Something
told
him
it
was
probably
a
lousy
idea.
As
he
moved
toward
the
mist
of
the
fountains,
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
sense
he
was
crossing
an
imaginary
threshold
into
another
world.
The
dreamlike
quality
of
the
evening
was
settling
around
him
again.
Twenty
minutes
ago
he
had
been
asleep
in
his
hotel
room.
Now
he
was
standing
in
front
of
a
transparent
pyramid
built
by
the
Sphinx,
waiting
for
a
policeman
they
called
the
Bull.
I'm
trapped
in
a
Salvador
Dali
painting,
he
thought.
Langdon
strode
to
the
main
entrance
an
enormous
revolving
door.
The
foyer
beyond
was
dimly
lit
and
deserted.
Do
I
knock?
Langdon
wondered
if
any
of
Harvard's
revered
Egyptologists
had
ever
knocked
on
the
front
door
of
a
pyramid
and
expected
an
answer.
He
raised
his
hand
to
bang
on
the
glass,
but
out
of
the
darkness
below,
a
figure
appeared,
striding
up
the
curving
staircase.
The
man
was
stocky
and
dark,
almost
Neanderthal,
dressed
in
a
dark
double
breasted
suit
that
strained
to
cover
his
wide
shoulders.
He
advanced
with
unmistakable
authority
on
squat,
powerful
legs.
He
was
speaking
on
his
cell
phone
but
finished
the
call
as
he
arrived.
He
motioned
for
Langdon
to
enter.
"I
am
Bezu
Fache,"
he
announced
as
Langdon
pushed
through
the
revolving
door.
"Captain
of
the
Central
Directorate
Judicial
Police."
His
tone
was
fitting
a
guttural
rumble
like
a
gathering
storm.
Langdon
held
out
his
hand
to
shake.
"Robert
Langdon."
Fache's
enormous
palm
wrapped
around
Langdon's
with
crushing
force.
"I
saw
the
photo,"
Langdon
said.
"Your
agent
said
Jacques
Sauniere
himself
did
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache's
ebony
eyes
locked
on.
"What
you
see
in
the
photo
is
only
the
beginning
of
what
Sauniere
did."
Captain
Bezu
Fache
carried
himself
like
an
angry
ox,
with
his
wide
shoulders
thrown
back
and
his
chin
tucked
hard
into
his
chest.
His
dark
hair
was
slicked
back
with
oil,
accentuating
an
arrow
like
widow's
peak
that
divided
his
jutting
brow
and
preceded
him
like
the
prow
of
a
battleship.
As
he
advanced,
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
scorch
the
earth
before
him,
radiating
a
fiery
clarity
that
forecast
his
reputation
for
unblinking
severity
in
all
matters.
Langdon
followed
the
captain
down
the
famous
marble
staircase
into
the
sunken
atrium
beneath
the
glass
pyramid.
As
they
descended,
they
passed
between
two
armed
Judicial
Police
guards
with
machine
guns.
The
message
was
clear:
Nobody
goes
in
or
out
tonight
without
the
blessing
of
Captain
Fache.
Descending
below
ground
level,
Langdon
fought
a
rising
trepidation.
Fache's
presence
was
anything
but
welcoming,
and
the
Louvre
itself
had
an
almost
sepulchral
aura
at
this
hour.
The
staircase,
like
the
aisle
of
a
dark
movie
theater,
was
illuminated
by
subtle
tread
lighting
embedded
in
each
step.
Langdon
could
hear
his
own
footsteps
reverberating
off
the
glass
overhead.
As
he
glanced
up,
he
