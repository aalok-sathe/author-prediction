I'm
with
eight
men
total.
Four
of
us
have
field
rifles
and
the
others
have
sidearms."
"Wait
for
me."
"Captain,
what
if
Langdon
has
a
hostage
in
there?
What
if
he
sees
us
and
decides
to
leave
on
foot?
We
need
to
move
now!
My
men
are
in
position
and
ready
to
go."
"Lieutenant
Collet,
you
will
wait
for
me
to
arrive
before
taking
action.
That
is
an
order."
Fache
hung
up.
Stunned,
Lieutenant
Collet
switched
off
his
phone.
Why
the
hell
is
Fache
asking
me
to
wait?
Collet
knew
the
answer.
Fache,
though
famous
for
his
instinct,
was
notorious
for
his
pride.
Fache
wants
credit
for
the
arrest.
After
putting
the
American's
face
all
over
the
television,
Fache
wanted
to
be
sure
his
own
face
got
equal
time.
Collet's
job
was
simply
to
hold
down
the
fort
until
the
boss
showed
up
to
save
the
day.
As
he
stood
there,
Collet
flashed
on
a
second
possible
explanation
for
this
delay.
Damage
control.
In
law
enforcement,
hesitating
to
arrest
a
fugitive
only
occurred
when
uncertainty
had
arisen
regarding
the
suspect's
guilt.
Is
Fache
having
second
thoughts
that
Langdon
is
the
right
man
?
The
thought
was
frightening.
Captain
Fache
had
gone
out
on
a
limb
tonight
to
arrest
Robert
Langdon
surveillance
cachee,
Interpol,
and
now
television.
Not
even
the
great
Bezu
Fache
would
survive
the
political
fallout
if
he
had
mistakenly
splashed
a
prominent
American's
face
all
over
French
television,
claiming
he
was
a
murderer.
If
Fache
now
realized
he'd
made
a
mistake,
then
it
made
perfect
sense
that
he
would
tell
Collet
not
to
make
a
move.
The
last
thing
Fache
needed
was
for
Collet
to
storm
an
innocent
Brit's
private
estate
and
take
Langdon
at
gunpoint.
Moreover,
Collet
realized,
if
Langdon
were
innocent,
it
explained
one
of
this
case's
strangest
paradoxes:
Why
had
Sophie
Neveu,
the
granddaughter
of
the
victim,
helped
the
alleged
killer
escape?
Unless
Sophie
knew
Langdon
was
falsely
charged.
Fache
had
posited
all
kinds
of
explanations
tonight
to
explain
Sophie's
odd
behavior,
including
that
Sophie,
as
Sauniere's
sole
heir,
had
persuaded
her
secret
lover
Robert
Langdon
to
kill
off
Sauniere
for
the
inheritance
money.
Sauniere,
if
he
had
suspected
this,
might
have
left
the
police
the
message
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Collet
was
fairly
certain
something
else
was
going
on
here.
Sophie
Neveu
seemed
far
too
solid
of
character
to
be
mixed
up
in
something
that
sordid.
"Lieutenant?"
One
of
the
field
agents
came
running
over.
"We
found
a
car."
Collet
followed
the
agent
about
fifty
yards
past
the
driveway.
The
agent
pointed
to
a
wide
shoulder
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road.
There,
parked
in
the
brush,
almost
out
of
sight,
was
a
black
Audi.
It
had
rental
plates.
Collet
felt
the
hood.
Still
warm.
Hot
even.
"That
must
be
how
Langdon
got
here,"
Collet
said.
"Call
the
rental
company.
Find
out
if
it's
stolen."
"Yes,
sir."
Another
agent
waved
Collet
back
over
in
the
direction
of
the
fence.
"Lieutenant,
have
a
look
