images
of
a
far
gentler
physique.
The
captain
approached
the
bed
and
hoisted
a
familiar,
heavy
black
briefcase
onto
a
chair.
"I
believe
this
belongs
to
you."
Aringarosa
looked
at
the
briefcase
filled
with
bonds
and
immediately
looked
away,
feeling
only
shame.
"Yes
thank
you."
He
paused
while
working
his
fingers
across
the
seam
of
his
bedsheet,
then
continued.
"Captain,
I
have
been
giving
this
deep
thought,
and
I
need
to
ask
a
favor
of
you."
"Of
course."
"The
families
of
those
in
Paris
who
Silas"
He
paused,
swallowing
the
emotion.
"I
realize
no
sum
could
possibly
serve
as
sufficient
restitution,
and
yet,
if
you
could
be
kind
enough
to
divide
the
contents
of
this
briefcase
among
them
the
families
of
the
deceased."
Fache's
dark
eyes
studied
him
a
long
moment.
"A
virtuous
gesture,
My
Lord.
I
will
see
to
it
your
wishes
are
carried
out.
A
heavy
silence
fell
between
them.
On
the
television,
a
lean
French
police
officer
was
giving
a
press
conference
in
front
of
a
sprawling
mansion.
Fache
saw
who
it
was
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
screen.
"Lieutenant
Collet,"
a
BBC
reporter
said,
her
voice
accusing.
"Last
night,
your
captain
publicly
charged
two
innocent
people
with
murder.
Will
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu
be
seeking
accountability
from
your
department?
Will
this
cost
Captain
Fache
his
job?"
Lieutenant
Collet's
smile
was
tired
but
calm.
"It
is
my
experience
that
Captain
Bezu
Fache
seldom
makes
mistakes.
I
have
not
yet
spoken
to
him
on
this
matter,
but
knowing
how
he
operates,
I
suspect
his
public
manhunt
for
Agent
Neveu
and
Mr.
Langdon
was
part
of
a
ruse
to
lure
out
the
real
killer.
The
reporters
exchanged
surprised
looks.
Collet
continued.
"Whether
or
not
Mr.
Langdon
and
Agent
Neveu
were
willing
participants
in
the
sting,
I
do
not
know.
Captain
Fache
tends
to
keep
his
more
creative
methods
to
himself.
All
I
can
confirm
at
this
point
is
that
the
captain
has
successfully
arrested
the
man
responsible,
and
that
Mr.
Langdon
and
Agent
Neveu
are
both
innocent
and
safe."
Fache
had
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
as
he
turned
back
to
Aringarosa.
"A
good
man,
that
Collet."
Several
moments
passed.
Finally,
Fache
ran
his
hand
over
his
forehead,
slicking
back
his
hair
as
he
gazed
down
at
Aringarosa.
"My
Lord,
before
I
return
to
Paris,
there
is
one
final
matter
I'd
like
to
discuss
your
impromptu
flight
to
London.
You
bribed
a
pilot
to
change
course.
In
doing
so,
you
broke
a
number
of
international
laws."
Aringarosa
slumped.
"I
was
desperate."
"Yes.
As
was
the
pilot
when
my
men
interrogated
him."
Fache
reached
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
purple
amethyst
ring
with
a
familiar
hand
tooled
mitre
crozier
applique.
Aringarosa
felt
tears
welling
as
he
accepted
the
ring
and
slipped
it
back
on
his
finger.
"You've
been
so
kind."
He
held
out
his
hand
and
clasped
Fache's.
"Thank
you."
Fache
waved
off
the
gesture,
walking
to
the
window
and
gazing
out
at
the
city,
his
