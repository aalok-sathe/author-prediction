had
heard
incorrectly.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"Plainly
stated,
six
months
from
today,
Opus
Dei
will
no
longer
be
considered
a
prelature
of
the
Vatican.
You
will
be
a
church
unto
yourself.
The
Holy
See
will
be
disassociating
itself
from
you.
His
Holiness
agrees
and
we
are
already
drawing
up
the
legal
papers."
"But
that
is
impossible!"
"On
the
contrary,
it
is
quite
possible.
And
necessary.
His
Holiness
has
become
uneasy
with
your
aggressive
recruiting
policies
and
your
practices
of
corporal
mortification."
He
paused.
"Also
your
policies
regarding
women.
Quite
frankly,
Opus
Dei
has
become
a
liability
and
an
embarrassment."
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
stupefied.
"An
embarrassment?"
"Certainly
you
cannot
be
surprised
it
has
come
to
this."
"Opus
Dei
is
the
only
Catholic
organization
whose
numbers
are
growing!
We
now
have
over
eleven
hundred
priests
!
"True.
A
troubling
issue
for
us
all."
Aringarosa
shot
to
his
feet.
"Ask
His
Holiness
if
Opus
Dei
was
an
embarrassment
in
1982
when
we
helped
the
Vatican
Bank!"
"The
Vatican
will
always
be
grateful
for
that,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
tone
appeasing,
"and
yet
there
are
those
who
still
believe
your
financial
munificence
in
1982
is
the
only
reason
you
were
granted
prelature
status
in
the
first
place."
"That
is
not
true!"
The
insinuation
offended
Aringarosa
deeply.
"Whatever
the
case,
we
plan
to
act
in
good
faith.
We
are
drawing
up
severance
terms
that
will
include
a
reimbursement
of
those
monies.
It
will
be
paid
in
five
installments."
"You
are
buying
me
off?"
Aringarosa
demanded.
"Paying
me
to
go
quietly?
When
Opus
Dei
is
the
only
remaining
voice
of
reason!"
One
of
the
cardinals
glanced
up.
"I'm
sorry,
did
you
say
reason?"
Aringarosa
leaned
across
the
table,
sharpening
his
tone
to
a
point.
"Do
you
really
wonder
why
Catholics
are
leaving
the
Church?
Look
around
you,
Cardinal.
People
have
lost
respect.
The
rigors
of
faith
are
gone.
The
doctrine
has
become
a
buffet
line.
Abstinence,
confession,
communion,
baptism,
mass
take
your
pick
choose
whatever
combination
pleases
you
and
ignore
the
rest.
What
kind
of
spiritual
guidance
is
the
Church
offering?"
"Third
century
laws,"
the
second
cardinal
said,
"cannot
be
applied
to
the
modern
followers
of
Christ.
The
rules
are
not
workable
in
today's
society."
"Well,
they
seem
to
be
working
for
Opus
Dei!"
"Bishop
Aringarosa,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
voice
conclusive.
"Out
of
respect
for
your
organization's
relationship
with
the
previous
Pope,
His
Holiness
will
be
giving
Opus
Dei
six
months
to
voluntarily
break
away
from
the
Vatican.
I
suggest
you
cite
your
differences
of
opinion
with
the
Holy
See
and
establish
yourself
as
your
own
Christian
organization."
"I
refuse!"
Aringarosa
declared.
"And
I'll
tell
him
that
in
person!"
"I'm
afraid
His
Holiness
no
longer
cares
to
meet
with
you."
Aringarosa
stood
up.
"He
would
not
dare
abolish
a
personal
prelature
established
by
a
previous
Pope!"
"I'm
sorry."
The
secretariat's
eyes
did
not
flinch.
"The
Lord
giveth
and
the
Lord
taketh
away."
Aringarosa
had
staggered
from
that
meeting
in
bewilderment
and
panic.
