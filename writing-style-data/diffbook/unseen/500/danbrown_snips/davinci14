tank.
Arriving
outside,
Langdon
peered
through
the
bars
into
the
dimly
lit
caverns
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
"After
you,
Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said.
Langdon
turned.
After
me,
where
?
Fache
motioned
toward
the
floor
at
the
base
of
the
grate.
Langdon
looked
down.
In
the
darkness,
he
hadn't
noticed.
The
barricade
was
raised
about
two
feet,
providing
an
awkward
clearance
underneath.
"This
area
is
still
off
limits
to
Louvre
security,"
Fache
said.
"My
team
from
Police
Technique
et
Scientifique
has
just
finished
their
investigation."
He
motioned
to
the
opening.
"Please
slide
under."
Langdon
stared
at
the
narrow
crawl
space
at
his
feet
and
then
up
at
the
massive
iron
grate.
He's
kidding,
right?
The
barricade
looked
like
a
guillotine
waiting
to
crush
intruders.
Fache
grumbled
something
in
French
and
checked
his
watch.
Then
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
slithered
his
bulky
frame
underneath
the
grate.
On
the
other
side,
he
stood
up
and
looked
back
through
the
bars
at
Langdon.
Langdon
sighed.
Placing
his
palms
flat
on
the
polished
parquet,
he
lay
on
his
stomach
and
pulled
himself
forward.
As
he
slid
underneath,
the
nape
of
his
Harris
tweed
snagged
on
the
bottom
of
the
grate,
and
he
cracked
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
iron.
Very
suave,
Robert,
he
thought,
fumbling
and
then
finally
pulling
himself
through.
As
he
stood
up,
Langdon
was
beginning
to
suspect
it
was
going
to
be
a
very
long
night.
Murray
Hill
Place
the
new
Opus
Dei
World
Headquarters
and
conference
center
is
located
at
243
Lexington
Avenue
in
New
York
City.
With
a
price
tag
of
just
over
$47
million,
the
133,000
square
foot
tower
is
clad
in
red
brick
and
Indiana
limestone.
Designed
by
May
&amp;
Pinska,
the
building
contains
over
one
hundred
bedrooms,
six
dining
rooms,
libraries,
living
rooms,
meeting
rooms,
and
offices.
The
second,
eighth,
and
sixteenth
floors
contain
chapels,
ornamented
with
mill
work
and
marble.
The
seventeenth
floor
is
entirely
residential.
Men
enter
the
building
through
the
main
doors
on
Lexington
Avenue.
Women
enter
through
a
side
street
and
are
"acoustically
and
visually
separated"
from
the
men
at
all
times
within
the
building.
Earlier
this
evening,
within
the
sanctuary
of
his
penthouse
apartment,
Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa
had
packed
a
small
travel
bag
and
dressed
in
a
traditional
black
cassock.
Normally,
he
would
have
wrapped
a
purple
cincture
around
his
waist,
but
tonight
he
would
be
traveling
among
the
public,
and
he
preferred
not
to
draw
attention
to
his
high
office.
Only
those
with
a
keen
eye
would
notice
his
14
karat
gold
bishop's
ring
with
purple
amethyst,
large
diamonds,
and
hand
tooled
mitre
crozier
applique.
Throwing
the
travel
bag
over
his
shoulder,
he
said
a
silent
prayer
and
left
his
apartment,
descending
to
the
lobby
where
his
driver
was
waiting
to
take
him
to
the
airport.
Now,
sitting
aboard
a
commercial
airliner
bound
for
Rome,
Aringarosa
gazed
out
the
window
at
the
dark
Atlantic.
The
sun
had
already
set,
but
Aringarosa
knew
his
own
star
was
on
