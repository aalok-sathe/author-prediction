and
so
the
sacred
feminine
was
demonized
and
called
unclean.
It
was
man,
not
God,
who
created
the
concept
of
'original
sin,'
whereby
Eve
tasted
of
the
apple
and
caused
the
downfall
of
the
human
race.
Woman,
once
the
sacred
giver
of
life,
was
now
the
enemy."
"I
should
add,"
Teabing
chimed,
"that
this
concept
of
woman
as
life
bringer
was
the
foundation
of
ancient
religion.
Childbirth
was
mystical
and
powerful.
Sadly,
Christian
philosophy
decided
to
embezzle
the
female's
creative
power
by
ignoring
biological
truth
and
making
man
the
Creator.
Genesis
tells
us
that
Eve
was
created
from
Adam's
rib.
Woman
became
an
offshoot
of
man.
And
a
sinful
one
at
that.
Genesis
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
goddess."
"The
Grail,"
Langdon
said,
"is
symbolic
of
the
lost
goddess.
When
Christianity
came
along,
the
old
pagan
religions
did
not
die
easily.
Legends
of
chivalric
quests
for
the
lost
Grail
were
in
fact
stories
of
forbidden
quests
to
find
the
lost
sacred
feminine.
Knights
who
claimed
to
be
"searching
for
the
chalice"
were
speaking
in
code
as
a
way
to
protect
themselves
from
a
Church
that
had
subjugated
women,
banished
the
Goddess,
burned
nonbelievers,
and
forbidden
the
pagan
reverence
for
the
sacred
feminine."
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"I'm
sorry,
when
you
said
the
Holy
Grail
was
a
person,
I
thought
you
meant
it
was
an
actual
person."
"It
is,"
Langdon
said.
"And
not
just
any
person,"
Teabing
blurted,
clambering
excitedly
to
his
feet.
"A
woman
who
carried
with
her
a
secret
so
powerful
that,
if
revealed,
it
threatened
to
devastate
the
very
foundation
of
Christianity!"
Sophie
looked
overwhelmed.
"Is
this
woman
well
known
in
history?"
"Quite."
Teabing
collected
his
crutches
and
motioned
down
the
hall.
"And
if
we
adjourn
to
the
study,
my
friends,
it
would
be
my
honor
to
show
you
Da
Vinci's
painting
of
her."
Two
rooms
away,
in
the
kitchen,
manservant
Remy
Legaludec
stood
in
silence
before
a
television.
The
news
station
was
broadcasting
photos
of
a
man
and
woman
the
same
two
individuals
to
whom
Remy
had
just
served
tea.
Standing
at
the
roadblock
outside
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich,
Lieutenant
Collet
wondered
what
was
taking
Fache
so
long
to
come
up
with
the
search
warrant.
The
bankers
were
obviously
hiding
something.
They
claimed
Langdon
and
Neveu
had
arrived
earlier
and
were
turned
away
from
the
bank
because
they
did
not
have
proper
account
identification.
So
why
won't
they
let
us
inside
for
a
look?
Finally,
Collet's
cellular
phone
rang.
It
was
the
command
post
at
the
Louvre.
"Do
we
have
a
search
warrant
yet?"
Collet
demanded.
"Forget
about
the
bank,
Lieutenant,"
the
agent
told
him.
"We
just
got
a
tip.
We
have
the
exact
location
where
Langdon
and
Neveu
are
hiding."
Collet
sat
down
hard
on
the
hood
of
his
car.
"You're
kidding."
"I
have
an
address
in
the
suburbs.
Somewhere
near
Versailles."
"Does
Captain
Fache
know?"
"Not
yet.
He's
busy
on
an
important
call."
"I'm
on
my
way.
Have
him
call
as
