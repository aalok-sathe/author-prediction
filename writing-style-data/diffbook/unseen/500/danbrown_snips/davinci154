the
lineage,
and
the
vine
from
which
the
sacred
fruit
sprang
forth!"
Sophie
felt
the
hairs
stand
up
on
her
arms.
"But
how
could
a
secret
that
big
be
kept
quiet
all
of
these
years?"
"Heavens!"
Teabing
said.
"It
has
been
anything
but
quiet!
The
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ
is
the
source
of
the
most
enduring
legend
of
all
time
the
Holy
Grail.
Magdalene's
story
has
been
shouted
from
the
rooftops
for
centuries
in
all
kinds
of
metaphors
and
languages.
Her
story
is
everywhere
once
you
open
your
eyes."
"And
the
Sangreal
documents?"
Sophie
said.
"They
allegedly
contain
proof
that
Jesus
had
a
royal
bloodline?"
"They
do."
"So
the
entire
Holy
Grail
legend
is
all
about
royal
blood?"
"Quite
literally,"
Teabing
said.
"The
word
Sangreal
derives
from
San
Great
or
Holy
Grail.
But
in
its
most
ancient
form,
the
word
Sangreal
was
divided
in
a
different
spot."
Teabing
wrote
on
a
piece
of
scrap
paper
and
handed
it
to
her.
She
read
what
he
had
written.
Sang
Real
Instantly,
Sophie
recognized
the
translation.
Sang
Real
literally
meant
Royal
Blood.
The
male
receptionist
in
the
lobby
of
the
Opus
Dei
headquarters
on
Lexington
Avenue
in
New
York
City
was
surprised
to
hear
Bishop
Aringarosa's
voice
on
the
line.
"Good
evening,
sir."
"Have
I
had
any
messages?"
the
bishop
demanded,
sounding
unusually
anxious.
"Yes,
sir.
I'm
very
glad
you
called
in.
I
couldn't
reach
you
in
your
apartment.
You
had
an
urgent
phone
message
about
half
an
hour
ago."
"Yes?"
He
sounded
relieved
by
the
news.
"Did
the
caller
leave
a
name?"
"No,
sir,
just
a
number."
The
operator
relayed
the
number.
"Prefix
thirty
three?
That's
France,
am
I
right?"
"Yes,
sir.
Paris.
The
caller
said
it
was
critical
you
contact
him
immediately."
"Thank
you.
I
have
been
waiting
for
that
call."
Aringarosa
quickly
severed
the
connection.
As
the
receptionist
hung
up
the
receiver,
he
wondered
why
Aringarosa's
phone
connection
sounded
so
crackly.
The
bishop's
daily
schedule
showed
him
in
New
York
this
weekend,
and
yet
he
sounded
a
world
away.
The
receptionist
shrugged
it
off.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
been
acting
very
strangely
the
last
few
months.
My
cellular
phone
must
not
have
been
receiving,
Aringarosa
thought
as
the
Fiat
approached
the
exit
for
Rome's
Ciampino
Charter
Airport.
The
Teacher
was
trying
to
reach
me.
Despite
Aringarosa's
concern
at
having
missed
the
call,
he
felt
encouraged
that
the
Teacher
felt
confident
enough
to
call
Opus
Dei
headquarters
directly.
Things
must
have
gone
well
in
Paris
tonight.
As
Aringarosa
began
dialing
the
number,
he
felt
excited
to
know
he
would
soon
be
in
Paris.
I'll
be
on
the
ground
before
dawn.
Aringarosa
had
a
chartered
turbo
prop
awaiting
him
here
for
the
short
flight
to
France.
Commercial
carriers
were
not
an
option
at
this
hour,
especially
considering
the
contents
of
his
briefcase.
The
line
began
to
ring.
A
female
voice
answered.
"Direction
Centrale
Police
Judidaire.
Aringarosa
felt
himself
hesitate.
This
was
unexpected.
"Ah,
yes
I
was
asked
to
call
this
number?"
"Qui
