paused
at
the
door,
looking
pale.
"But
of
course.
Like
most
Swiss
banks,
our
safe
deposit
boxes
are
attached
to
a
number,
not
a
name.
You
have
a
key
and
a
personal
account
number
known
only
to
you.
Your
key
is
only
half
of
your
identification.
Your
personal
account
number
is
the
other
half.
Otherwise,
if
you
lost
your
key,
anyone
could
use
it."
Sophie
hesitated.
"And
if
my
benefactor
gave
me
no
account
number?"
The
banker's
heart
pounded.
Then
you
obviously
have
no
business
here!
He
gave
them
a
calm
smile.
"I
will
ask
someone
to
help
you.
He
will
be
in
shortly."
Leaving,
the
banker
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
twisted
a
heavy
lock,
sealing
them
inside.
Across
town,
Collet
was
standing
in
the
Gare
du
Nord
train
terminal
when
his
phone
rang.
It
was
Fache.
"Interpol
got
a
tip,"
he
said.
"Forget
the
train.
Langdon
and
Neveu
just
walked
into
the
Paris
branch
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
I
want
your
men
over
there
right
away."
"Any
leads
yet
on
what
Sauniere
was
trying
to
tell
Agent
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon?"
Fache's
tone
was
cold.
"If
you
arrest
them,
Lieutenant
Collet,
then
I
can
ask
them
personally."
Collet
took
the
hint.
"Twenty
four
Rue
Haxo.
Right
away,
Captain."
He
hung
up
and
radioed
his
men.
Andre
Vernet
president
of
the
Paris
branch
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
lived
in
a
lavish
flat
above
the
bank.
Despite
his
plush
accommodations,
he
had
always
dreamed
of
owning
a
riverside
apartment
on
L'lle
Saint
Louis,
where
he
could
rub
shoulders
with
the
true
cognoscenti,
rather
than
here,
where
he
simply
met
the
filthy
rich.
When
I
retire,
Vernet
told
himself,
will
fill
my
cellar
with
rare
Bordeaux,
adorn
my
salon
with
a
Fragonard
and
perhaps
a
Boucher,
and
spend
my
days
hunting
for
antique
furniture
and
rare
books
in
the
Quartier
Latin.
Tonight,
Vernet
had
been
awake
only
six
and
a
half
minutes.
Even
so,
as
he
hurried
through
the
bank's
underground
corridor,
he
looked
as
if
his
personal
tailor
and
hairdresser
had
polished
him
to
a
fine
sheen.
Impeccably
dressed
in
a
silk
suit,
Vernet
sprayed
some
breath
spray
in
his
mouth
and
tightened
his
tie
as
he
walked.
No
stranger
to
being
awoken
to
attend
to
his
international
clients
arriving
from
different
time
zones,
Vernet
modeled
his
sleep
habits
after
the
Maasai
warriors
the
African
tribe
famous
for
their
ability
to
rise
from
the
deepest
sleep
to
a
state
of
total
battle
readiness
in
a
matter
of
seconds.
Battle
ready,
Vernet
thought,
fearing
the
comparison
might
be
uncharacteristically
apt
tonight.
The
arrival
of
a
gold
key
client
always
required
an
extra
flurry
of
attention,
but
the
arrival
of
a
gold
key
client
who
was
wanted
by
the
Judicial
Police
would
be
an
extremely
delicate
matter.
The
bank
had
enough
battles
with
law
enforcement
over
the
privacy
rights
of
their
clients
without
proof
that
some
of
them
were
criminals.
Five
minutes,
Vernet
told
himself.
