and
tossed
unceremoniously
into
the
Tiber
River.
But
this
poem
refers
to
a
tomb.
A
tomb
in
London.
And
there
are
few
knights
buried
in
London.
"
He
paused,
eyeing
Langdon
as
if
waiting
for
light
to
dawn.
Finally
he
huffed.
"Robert,
for
heaven's
sake!
The
church
built
in
London
by
the
Priory's
military
arm
the
Knights
Templar
themselves
!
"The
Temple
Church?"
Langdon
drew
a
startled
breath.
"It
has
a
crypt?"
"Ten
of
the
most
frightening
tombs
you
will
ever
see."
Langdon
had
never
actually
visited
the
Temple
Church,
although
he'd
come
across
numerous
references
in
his
Priory
research.
Once
the
epicenter
of
all
TemplarPriory
activities
in
the
United
Kingdom,
the
Temple
Church
had
been
so
named
in
honor
of
Solomon's
Temple,
from
which
the
Knights
Templar
had
extracted
their
own
title,
as
well
as
the
Sangreal
documents
that
gave
them
all
their
influence
in
Rome.
Tales
abounded
of
knights
performing
strange,
secretive
rituals
within
the
Temple
Church's
unusual
sanctuary.
"The
Temple
Church
is
on
Fleet
Street?"
"Actually,
it's
just
off
Fleet
Street
on
Inner
Temple
Lane."
Teabing
looked
mischievous.
"I
wanted
to
see
you
sweat
a
little
more
before
I
gave
it
away."
"Thanks."
"Neither
of
you
has
ever
been
there?"
Sophie
and
Langdon
shook
their
heads.
"I'm
not
surprised,"
Teabing
said.
"The
church
is
hidden
now
behind
much
larger
buildings.
Few
people
even
know
it's
there.
Eerie
old
place.
The
architecture
is
pagan
to
the
core."
Sophie
looked
surprised.
"Pagan?"
"Pantheonically
pagan!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"The
church
is
round.
The
Templars
ignored
the
traditional
Christian
cruciform
layout
and
built
a
perfectly
circular
church
in
honor
of
the
sun."
His
eyebrows
did
a
devilish
dance.
"A
not
so
subtle
howdy
do
to
the
boys
in
Rome.
They
might
as
well
have
resurrected
Stonehenge
in
downtown
London."
Sophie
eyed
Teabing.
"What
about
the
rest
of
the
poem?"
The
historian's
mirthful
air
faded.
"I'm
not
sure.
It's
puzzling.
We
will
need
to
examine
each
of
the
ten
tombs
carefully.
With
luck,
one
of
them
will
have
a
conspicuously
absent
orb."
Langdon
realized
how
close
they
really
were.
If
the
missing
orb
revealed
the
password,
they
would
be
able
to
open
the
second
cryptex.
He
had
a
hard
time
imagining
what
they
might
find
inside.
Langdon
eyed
the
poem
again.
It
was
like
some
kind
of
primordial
crossword
puzzle.
A
five
letter
word
that
speaks
of
the
Grail?
On
the
plane,
they
had
already
tried
all
the
obvious
passwords
GRAIL,
GRAAL,
GREAL,
VENUS,
MARIA,
JESUS,
SARAH
but
the
cylinder
had
not
budged.
Far
too
obvious.
Apparently
there
existed
some
other
five
letter
reference
to
the
Rose's
seeded
womb.
The
fact
that
the
word
was
eluding
a
specialist
like
Leigh
Teabing
signified
to
Langdon
that
it
was
no
ordinary
Grail
reference.
"Sir
Leigh?"
Remy
called
over
his
shoulder.
He
was
watching
them
in
the
rearview
mirror
through
the
open
divider.
"You
said
Fleet
Street
is
near
Blackfriars
Bridge?"
"Yes,
take
Victoria
Embankment."
"I'm
sorry.
I'm
not
sure
where
that
is.
We
usually
