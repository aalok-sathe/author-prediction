Knights
discovered
something
down
there
in
the
ruins
something
that
made
them
wealthy
and
powerful
beyond
anyone's
wildest
imagination."
Langdon
quickly
gave
Sophie
the
standard
academic
sketch
of
the
accepted
Knights
Templar
history,
explaining
how
the
Knights
were
in
the
Holy
Land
during
the
Second
Crusade
and
told
King
Baldwin
II
that
they
were
there
to
protect
Christian
pilgrims
on
the
roadways.
Although
unpaid
and
sworn
to
poverty,
the
Knights
told
the
king
they
required
basic
shelter
and
requested
his
permission
to
take
up
residence
in
the
stables
under
the
ruins
of
the
temple.
King
Baldwin
granted
the
soldiers'
request,
and
the
Knights
took
up
their
meager
residence
inside
the
devastated
shrine.
The
odd
choice
of
lodging,
Langdon
explained,
had
been
anything
but
random.
The
Knights
believed
the
documents
the
Priory
sought
were
buried
deep
under
the
ruins
beneath
the
Holy
of
Holies,
a
sacred
chamber
where
God
Himself
was
believed
to
reside.
Literally,
the
very
center
of
the
Jewish
faith.
For
almost
a
decade,
the
nine
Knights
lived
in
the
ruins,
excavating
in
total
secrecy
through
solid
rock.
Sophie
looked
over.
"And
you
said
they
discovered
something?"
"They
certainly
did,"
Langdon
said,
explaining
how
it
had
taken
nine
years,
but
the
Knights
had
finally
found
what
they
had
been
searching
for.
They
took
the
treasure
from
the
temple
and
traveled
to
Europe,
where
their
influence
seemed
to
solidify
overnight.
Nobody
was
certain
whether
the
Knights
had
blackmailed
the
Vatican
or
whether
the
Church
simply
tried
to
buy
the
Knights'
silence,
but
Pope
Innocent
II
immediately
issued
an
unprecedented
papal
bull
that
afforded
the
Knights
Templar
limitless
power
and
declared
them
"a
law
unto
themselves"
an
autonomous
army
independent
of
all
interference
from
kings
and
prelates,
both
religious
and
political.
With
their
new
carte
blanche
from
the
Vatican,
the
Knights
Templar
expanded
at
a
staggering
rate,
both
in
numbers
and
political
force,
amassing
vast
estates
in
over
a
dozen
countries.
They
began
extending
credit
to
bankrupt
royals
and
charging
interest
in
return,
thereby
establishing
modern
banking
and
broadening
their
wealth
and
influence
still
further.
By
the
1300s,
the
Vatican
sanction
had
helped
the
Knights
amass
so
much
power
that
Pope
Clement
V
decided
that
something
had
to
be
done.
Working
in
concert
with
France's
King
Philippe
IV,
the
Pope
devised
an
ingeniously
planned
sting
operation
to
quash
the
Templars
and
seize
their
treasure,
thus
taking
control
of
the
secrets
held
over
the
Vatican.
In
a
military
maneuver
worthy
of
the
CIA,
Pope
Clement
issued
secret
sealed
orders
to
be
opened
simultaneously
by
his
soldiers
all
across
Europe
on
Friday,
October
13
of
1307.
At
dawn
on
the
thirteenth,
the
documents
were
unsealed
and
their
appalling
contents
revealed.
Clement's
letter
claimed
that
God
had
visited
him
in
a
vision
and
warned
him
that
the
Knights
Templar
were
heretics
guilty
of
devil
worship,
homosexuality,
defiling
the
cross,
sodomy,
and
other
blasphemous
behavior.
Pope
Clement
had
been
asked
by
God
to
cleanse
the
earth
by
rounding
up
all
the
Knights
and
torturing
them
