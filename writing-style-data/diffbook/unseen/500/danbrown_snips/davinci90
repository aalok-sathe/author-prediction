of
cash.
The
taxi
driver
nodded
and
then,
to
Langdon's
bewilderment,
sped
off
without
them.
"What
happened?"
Langdon
demanded,
joining
Sophie
on
the
curb
as
the
taxi
disappeared.
Sophie
was
already
heading
for
the
train
station
entrance.
"Come
on.
We're
buying
two
tickets
on
the
next
train
out
of
Paris."
Langdon
hurried
along
beside
her.
What
had
begun
as
a
one
mile
dash
to
the
U.S.
Embassy
had
now
become
a
full
fledged
evacuation
from
Paris.
Langdon
was
liking
this
idea
less
and
less.
The
driver
who
collected
Bishop
Aringarosa
from
Leonardo
da
Vinci
International
Airport
pulled
up
in
a
small,
unimpressive
black
Fiat
sedan.
Aringarosa
recalled
a
day
when
all
Vatican
transports
were
big
luxury
cars
that
sported
grille
plate
medallions
and
flags
emblazoned
with
the
seal
of
the
Holy
See.
Those
days
are
gone.
Vatican
cars
were
now
less
ostentatious
and
almost
always
unmarked.
The
Vatican
claimed
this
was
to
cut
costs
to
better
serve
their
dioceses,
but
Aringarosa
suspected
it
was
more
of
a
security
measure.
The
world
had
gone
mad,
and
in
many
parts
of
Europe,
advertising
your
love
of
Jesus
Christ
was
like
painting
a
bull's
eye
on
the
roof
of
your
car.
Bundling
his
black
cassock
around
himself,
Aringarosa
climbed
into
the
back
seat
and
settled
in
for
the
long
drive
to
Castel
Gandolfo.
It
would
be
the
same
ride
he
had
taken
five
months
ago.
Last
year's
trip
to
Rome,
he
sighed.
The
longest
night
of
my
life.
Five
months
ago,
the
Vatican
had
phoned
to
request
Aringarosa's
immediate
presence
in
Rome.
They
offered
no
explanation.
Your
tickets
are
at
the
airport.
The
Holy
See
worked
hard
to
retain
a
veil
of
mystery,
even
for
its
highest
clergy.
The
mysterious
summons,
Aringarosa
suspected,
was
probably
a
photo
opportunity
for
the
Pope
and
other
Vatican
officials
to
piggyback
on
Opus
Dei's
recent
public
success
the
completion
of
their
World
Headquarters
in
New
York
City.
Architectural
Digest
had
called
Opus
Dei's
building
"a
shining
beacon
of
Catholicism
sublimely
integrated
with
the
modern
landscape,"
and
lately
the
Vatican
seemed
to
be
drawn
to
anything
and
everything
that
included
the
word
"modern."
Aringarosa
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
invitation,
albeit
reluctantly.
Not
a
fan
of
the
current
papal
administration,
Aringarosa,
like
most
conservative
clergy,
had
watched
with
grave
concern
as
the
new
Pope
settled
into
his
first
year
in
office.
An
unprecedented
liberal,
His
Holiness
had
secured
the
papacy
through
one
of
the
most
controversial
and
unusual
conclaves
in
Vatican
history.
Now,
rather
than
being
humbled
by
his
unexpected
rise
to
power,
the
Holy
Father
had
wasted
no
time
flexing
all
the
muscle
associated
with
the
highest
office
in
Christendom.
Drawing
on
an
unsettling
tide
of
liberal
support
within
the
College
of
Cardinals,
the
Pope
was
now
declaring
his
papal
mission
to
be
"rejuvenation
of
Vatican
doctrine
and
updating
Catholicism
into
the
third
millennium."
The
translation,
Aringarosa
feared,
was
that
the
man
was
actually
arrogant
enough
to
think
he
could
rewrite
God's
laws
and
win
