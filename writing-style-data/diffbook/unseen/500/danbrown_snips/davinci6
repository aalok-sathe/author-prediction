codes
hidden
in
the
paintings
of
Poussin
and
Teniers
were
some
of
Langdon's
favorite
classroom
texts.
Tonight's
meeting
had
been
one
Langdon
was
very
much
looking
forward
to,
and
he
was
disappointed
when
the
curator
had
not
shown.
Again
the
image
of
the
curator's
body
flashed
in
his
mind.
Jacques
Sauniere
did
that
to
himself?
Langdon
turned
and
looked
out
the
window,
forcing
the
picture
from
his
mind.
Outside,
the
city
was
just
now
winding
down
street
vendors
wheeling
carts
of
candied
amandes,
waiters
carrying
bags
of
garbage
to
the
curb,
a
pair
of
late
night
lovers
cuddling
to
stay
warm
in
a
breeze
scented
with
jasmine
blossom.
The
Citroen
navigated
the
chaos
with
authority,
its
dissonant
two
tone
siren
parting
the
traffic
like
a
knife.
"he
capitaine
was
pleased
to
discover
you
were
still
in
Paris
tonight,"
the
agent
said,
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
they'd
left
the
hotel.
"A
fortunate
coincidence."
Langdon
was
feeling
anything
but
fortunate,
and
coincidence
was
a
concept
he
did
not
entirely
trust.
As
someone
who
had
spent
his
life
exploring
the
hidden
interconnectivity
of
disparate
emblems
and
ideologies,
Langdon
viewed
the
world
as
a
web
of
profoundly
intertwined
histories
and
events.
The
connections
may
be
invisible,
he
often
preached
to
his
symbology
classes
at
Harvard,
but
they
are
always
there,
buried
just
beneath
the
surface.
"I
assume,"
Langdon
said,
"that
the
American
University
of
Paris
told
you
where
I
was
staying?"
The
driver
shook
his
head.
"Interpol."
Interpol,
Langdon
thought.
Of
course.
He
had
forgotten
that
the
seemingly
innocuous
request
of
all
European
hotels
to
see
a
passport
at
check
in
was
more
than
a
quaint
formality
it
was
the
law.
On
any
given
night,
all
across
Europe,
Interpol
officials
could
pinpoint
exactly
who
was
sleeping
where.
Finding
Langdon
at
the
Ritz
had
probably
taken
all
of
five
seconds.
As
the
Citroen
accelerated
southward
across
the
city,
the
illuminated
profile
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
appeared,
shooting
skyward
in
the
distance
to
the
right.
Seeing
it,
Langdon
thought
of
Vittoria,
recalling
their
playful
promise
a
year
ago
that
every
six
months
they
would
meet
again
at
a
different
romantic
spot
on
the
globe.
The
Eiffel
Tower,
Langdon
suspected,
would
have
made
their
list.
Sadly,
he
last
kissed
Vittoria
in
a
noisy
airport
in
Rome
more
than
a
year
ago.
"Did
you
mount
her?"
the
agent
asked,
looking
over.
Langdon
glanced
up,
certain
he
had
misunderstood.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"She
is
lovely,
no?"
The
agent
motioned
through
the
windshield
toward
the
Eiffel
Tower.
"Have
you
mounted
her?"
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes.
"No,
I
haven't
climbed
the
tower."
"She
is
the
symbol
of
France.
I
think
she
is
perfect."
Langdon
nodded
absently.
Symbologists
often
remarked
that
France
a
country
renowned
for
machismo,
womanizing,
and
diminutive
insecure
leaders
like
Napoleon
and
Pepin
the
Short
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
apt
national
emblem
than
a
thousand
foot
phallus.
When
they
reached
the
intersection
at
Rue
de
Rivoli,
the
traffic
light
was
red,
but
the
Citroen
