at
the
smooth
surface
on
the
broad
arm
of
the
cross.
It
seemed
to
shimmer
in
places
like
it
was
wet.
"How
well
did
you
look
at
the
back
of
this
key
before
you
put
it
in
your
pocket?"
"What?
Not
well.
I
was
in
a
hurry."
Langdon
turned
to
her.
"Do
you
still
have
the
black
light?"
Sophie
reached
in
her
pocket
and
produced
the
UV
penlight.
Langdon
took
it
and
switched
it
on,
shining
the
beam
on
the
back
of
the
key.
The
back
luminesced
instantly.
There
was
writing
there.
In
penmanship
that
was
hurried
but
legible.
Well,"
Langdon
said,
smiling.
"I
guess
we
know
what
the
alcohol
smell
was."
Sophie
stared
in
amazement
at
the
purple
writing
on
the
back
of
the
key.
24
Rue
Haxo
An
address!
My
grandfather
wrote
down
an
address!
"Where
is
this?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
had
no
idea.
Facing
front
again,
she
leaned
forward
and
excitedly
asked
the
driver,
"Connaissez
vous
la
Rue
Haxo?"
The
driver
thought
a
moment
and
then
nodded.
He
told
Sophie
it
was
out
near
the
tennis
stadium
on
the
western
outskirts
of
Paris.
She
asked
him
to
take
them
there
immediately.
"Fastest
route
is
through
Bois
de
Boulogne,"
the
driver
told
her
in
French.
"Is
that
okay?"
Sophie
frowned.
She
could
think
of
far
less
scandalous
routes,
but
tonight
she
was
not
going
to
be
picky.
"Oui."
We
can
shock
the
visiting
American.
Sophie
looked
back
at
the
key
and
wondered
what
they
would
possibly
find
at
24
Rue
Haxo.
A
church?
Some
kind
of
Priory
headquarters?
Her
mind
filled
again
with
images
of
the
secret
ritual
she
had
witnessed
in
the
basement
grotto
ten
years
ago,
and
she
heaved
a
long
sigh.
"Robert,
I
have
a
lot
of
things
to
tell
you."
She
paused,
locking
eyes
with
him
as
the
taxi
raced
westward.
"But
first
I
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
this
Priory
of
Sion."
Outside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Bezu
Fache
was
fuming
as
Louvre
warden
Grouard
explained
how
Sophie
and
Langdon
had
disarmed
him.
Why
didn't
you
just
shoot
the
blessed
painting!
"Captain?"
Lieutenant
Collet
loped
toward
them
from
the
direction
of
the
command
post.
"Captain,
I
just
heard.
They
located
Agent
Neveu's
car."
"Did
she
make
the
embassy?"
"No.
Train
station.
Bought
two
tickets.
Train
just
left."
Fache
waved
off
warden
Grouard
and
led
Collet
to
a
nearby
alcove,
addressing
him
in
hushed
tones.
"What
was
the
destination?"
"Lyon."
"Probably
a
decoy."
Fache
exhaled,
formulating
a
plan.
"Okay,
alert
the
next
station,
have
the
train
stopped
and
searched,
just
in
case.
Leave
her
car
where
it
is
and
put
plainclothes
on
watch
in
case
they
try
to
come
back
to
it.
Send
men
to
search
the
streets
around
the
station
in
case
they
fled
on
foot.
Are
buses
running
from
the
station?"
"Not
at
this
hour,
sir.
Only
the
taxi
queue."
"Good.
Question
the
drivers.
See
if
they
saw
anything.
Then
contact
the
taxi
company
dispatcher
with
descriptions.
I'm
