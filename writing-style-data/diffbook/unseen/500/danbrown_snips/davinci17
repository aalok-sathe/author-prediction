decade,
he
had
been
following
The
Way,
cleansing
himself
of
sins
rebuilding
his
life
erasing
the
violence
in
his
past.
Tonight,
however,
it
had
all
come
rushing
back.
The
hatred
he
had
fought
so
hard
to
bury
had
been
summoned.
He
had
been
startled
how
quickly
his
past
had
resurfaced.
And
with
it,
of
course,
had
come
his
skills.
Rusty
but
serviceable.
Jesus'
message
is
one
of
peace
of
nonviolence
of
love.
This
was
the
message
Silas
had
been
taught
from
the
beginning,
and
the
message
he
held
in
his
heart.
And
yet
this
was
the
message
the
enemies
of
Christ
now
threatened
to
destroy.
Those
who
threaten
God
with
force
will
be
met
with
force.
Immovable
and
steadfast.
For
two
millennia,
Christian
soldiers
had
defended
their
faith
against
those
who
tried
to
displace
it.
Tonight,
Silas
had
been
called
to
battle.
Drying
his
wounds,
he
donned
his
ankle
length,
hooded
robe.
It
was
plain,
made
of
dark
wool,
accentuating
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
and
hair.
Tightening
the
rope
tie
around
his
waist,
he
raised
the
hood
over
his
head
and
allowed
his
red
eyes
to
admire
his
reflection
in
the
mirror.
The
wheels
are
in
motion.
Having
squeezed
beneath
the
security
gate,
Robert
Langdon
now
stood
just
inside
the
entrance
to
the
Grand
Gallery.
He
was
staring
into
the
mouth
of
a
long,
deep
canyon.
On
either
side
of
the
gallery,
stark
walls
rose
thirty
feet,
evaporating
into
the
darkness
above.
The
reddish
glow
of
the
service
lighting
sifted
upward,
casting
an
unnatural
smolder
across
a
staggering
collection
of
Da
Vincis,
Titians,
and
Caravaggios
that
hung
suspended
from
ceiling
cables.
Still
lifes,
religious
scenes,
and
landscapes
accompanied
portraits
of
nobility
and
politicians.
Although
the
Grand
Gallery
housed
the
Louvre's
most
famous
Italian
art,
many
visitors
felt
the
wing's
most
stunning
offering
was
actually
its
famous
parquet
floor.
Laid
out
in
a
dazzling
geometric
design
of
diagonal
oak
slats,
the
floor
produced
an
ephemeral
optical
illusion
a
multi
dimensional
network
that
gave
visitors
the
sense
they
were
floating
through
the
gallery
on
a
surface
that
changed
with
every
step.
As
Langdon's
gaze
began
to
trace
the
inlay,
his
eyes
stopped
short
on
an
unexpected
object
lying
on
the
floor
just
a
few
yards
to
his
left,
surrounded
by
police
tape.
He
spun
toward
Fache.
"Is
that
a
Caravaggio
on
the
floor?"
Fache
nodded
without
even
looking.
The
painting,
Langdon
guessed,
was
worth
upward
of
two
million
dollars,
and
yet
it
was
lying
on
the
floor
like
a
discarded
poster.
"What
the
devil
is
it
doing
on
the
floor!"
Fache
glowered,
clearly
unmoved.
"This
is
a
crime
scene,
Mr.
Langdon.
We
have
touched
nothing.
That
canvas
was
pulled
from
the
wall
by
the
curator.
It
was
how
he
activated
the
security
system."
Langdon
looked
back
at
the
gate,
trying
to
picture
what
had
happened.
"The
curator
was
attacked
in
his
office,
fled
into
the
Grand
Gallery,
and
activated
the
security
gate
by
pulling
that
painting
from
the
wall.
