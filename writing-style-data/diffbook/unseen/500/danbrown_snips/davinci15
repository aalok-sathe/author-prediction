the
rise.
Tonight
the
battle
will
be
won,
he
thought,
amazed
that
only
months
ago
he
had
felt
powerless
against
the
hands
that
threatened
to
destroy
his
empire.
As
president
general
of
Opus
Dei,
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
spent
the
last
decade
of
his
life
spreading
the
message
of
"God's
Work"
literally,
Opus
Dei.
The
congregation,
founded
in
1928
by
the
Spanish
priest
Josemaria
Escriva,
promoted
a
return
to
conservative
Catholic
values
and
encouraged
its
members
to
make
sweeping
sacrifices
in
their
own
lives
in
order
to
do
the
Work
of
God.
Opus
Dei's
traditionalist
philosophy
initially
had
taken
root
in
Spain
before
Franco's
regime,
but
with
the
1934
publication
of
Josemaria
Escriva's
spiritual
book
The
Way
999
points
of
meditation
for
doing
God's
Work
in
one's
own
life
Escriva's
message
exploded
across
the
world.
Now,
with
over
four
million
copies
of
The
Way
in
circulation
in
forty
two
languages,
Opus
Dei
was
a
global
force.
Its
residence
halls,
teaching
centers,
and
even
universities
could
be
found
in
almost
every
major
metropolis
on
earth.
Opus
Dei
was
the
fastest
growing
and
most
financially
secure
Catholic
organization
in
the
world.
Unfortunately,
Aringarosa
had
learned,
in
an
age
of
religious
cynicism,
cults,
and
televangelists,
Opus
Dei's
escalating
wealth
and
power
was
a
magnet
for
suspicion.
"Many
call
Opus
Dei
a
brainwashing
cult,"
reporters
often
challenged.
"Others
call
you
an
ultraconservative
Christian
secret
society.
Which
are
you?"
"Opus
Dei
is
neither,"
the
bishop
would
patiently
reply.
"We
are
a
Catholic
Church.
We
are
a
congregation
of
Catholics
who
have
chosen
as
our
priority
to
follow
Catholic
doctrine
as
rigorously
as
we
can
in
our
own
daily
lives."
"Does
God's
Work
necessarily
include
vows
of
chastity,
tithing,
and
atonement
for
sins
through
self
flagellation
and
the
cilice?"
"You
are
describing
only
a
small
portion
of
the
Opus
Dei
population,"
Aringarosa
said.
"There
are
many
levels
of
involvement.
Thousands
of
Opus
Dei
members
are
married,
have
families,
and
do
God's
Work
in
their
own
communities.
Others
choose
lives
of
asceticism
within
our
cloistered
residence
halls.
These
choices
are
personal,
but
everyone
in
Opus
Dei
shares
the
goal
of
bettering
the
world
by
doing
the
Work
of
God.
Surely
this
is
an
admirable
quest."
Reason
seldom
worked,
though.
The
media
always
gravitated
toward
scandal,
and
Opus
Dei,
like
most
large
organizations,
had
within
its
membership
a
few
misguided
souls
who
cast
a
shadow
over
the
entire
group.
Two
months
ago,
an
Opus
Dei
group
at
a
midwestern
university
had
been
caught
drugging
new
recruits
with
mescaline
in
an
effort
to
induce
a
euphoric
state
that
neophytes
would
perceive
as
a
religious
experience.
Another
university
student
had
used
his
barbed
cilice
belt
more
often
than
the
recommended
two
hours
a
day
and
had
given
himself
a
near
lethal
infection.
In
Boston
not
long
ago,
a
disillusioned
young
investment
banker
had
signed
over
his
entire
life
savings
to
Opus
Dei
before
attempting
suicide.
Misguided
sheep,
Aringarosa
thought,
his
heart
going
out
to
them.
Of
course
the
ultimate
embarrassment
had
