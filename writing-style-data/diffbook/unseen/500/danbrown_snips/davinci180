the
far
end
of
the
airstrip.
As
they
approached,
a
tousled
man
in
wrinkled
khakis
hurried
from
the
hangar,
waved,
and
slid
open
the
enormous
corrugated
metal
door
to
reveal
a
sleek
white
jet
within.
Langdon
stared
at
the
glistening
fuselage.
"That's
Elizabeth?"
Teabing
grinned.
"Beats
the
bloody
Chunnel."
The
man
in
khakis
hurried
toward
them,
squinting
into
the
headlights.
"Almost
ready,
sir,"
he
called
in
a
British
accent.
"My
apologies
for
the
delay,
but
you
took
me
by
surprise
and
"
He
stopped
short
as
the
group
unloaded.
He
looked
at
Sophie
and
Langdon,
and
then
Teabing.
Teabing
said,
"My
associates
and
I
have
urgent
business
in
London.
We've
no
time
to
waste.
Please
prepare
to
depart
immediately."
As
he
spoke,
Teabing
took
the
pistol
out
of
the
vehicle
and
handed
it
to
Langdon.
The
pilot's
eyes
bulged
at
the
sight
of
the
weapon.
He
walked
over
to
Teabing
and
whispered,
"Sir,
my
humble
apologies,
but
my
diplomatic
flight
allowance
provides
only
for
you
and
your
manservant.
I
cannot
take
your
guests."
"Richard,"
Teabing
said,
smiling
warmly,
"two
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
that
loaded
gun
say
you
can
take
my
guests."
He
motioned
to
the
Range
Rover.
"And
the
unfortunate
fellow
in
the
back."
The
Hawker
731's
twin
Garrett
TFE
731
engines
thundered,
powering
the
plane
skyward
with
gut
wrenching
force.
Outside
the
window,
Le
Bourget
Airfield
dropped
away
with
startling
speed.
I'm
fleeing
the
country,
Sophie
thought,
her
body
forced
back
into
the
leather
seat.
Until
this
moment,
she
had
believed
her
game
of
cat
and
mouse
with
Fache
would
be
somehow
justifiable
to
the
Ministry
of
Defense.
was
attempting
to
protect
an
innocent
man.
I
was
trying
to
fulfill
my
grandfather's
dying
wishes.
That
window
of
opportunity,
Sophie
knew,
had
just
closed.
She
was
leaving
the
country,
without
documentation,
accompanying
a
wanted
man,
and
transporting
a
bound
hostage.
If
a
"line
of
reason"
had
ever
existed,
she
had
just
crossed
it.
At
almost
the
speed
of
sound.
Sophie
was
seated
with
Langdon
and
Teabing
near
the
front
of
the
cabin
the
Fan
Jet
Executive
Elite
Design,
according
to
the
gold
medallion
on
the
door.
Their
plush
swivel
chairs
were
bolted
to
tracks
on
the
floor
and
could
be
repositioned
and
locked
around
a
rectangular
hardwood
table.
A
mini
boardroom.
The
dignified
surroundings,
however,
did
little
to
camouflage
the
less
than
dignified
state
of
affairs
in
the
rear
of
the
plane
where,
in
a
separate
seating
area
near
the
rest
room,
Teabing's
manservant
Remy
sat
with
the
pistol
in
hand,
begrudgingly
carrying
out
Teabing's
orders
to
stand
guard
over
the
bloody
monk
who
lay
trussed
at
his
feet
like
a
piece
of
luggage.
"Before
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
keystone,"
Teabing
said,
"I
was
wondering
if
you
would
permit
me
a
few
words."
He
sounded
apprehensive,
like
a
father
about
to
give
the
birds
and
the
bees
lecture
to
his
children.
"My
friends,
I
realize
I
am
but
a
guest
on
this
journey,
and
I
am
honored
