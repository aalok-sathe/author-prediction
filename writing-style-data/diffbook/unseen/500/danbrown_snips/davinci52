away
from
the
Louvre.
A
police
exodus.
Fache
had
hurried
off
as
well,
leaving
the
Grand
Gallery
deserted.
"There's
an
emergency
stairwell
about
fifty
meters
back
into
the
Grand
Gallery,"
Sophie
said.
"Now
that
the
guards
are
leaving
the
perimeter,
we
can
get
out
of
here."
Langdon
decided
not
to
say
another
word
all
evening.
Sophie
Neveu
was
clearly
a
hell
of
a
lot
smarter
than
he
was.
The
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice,
it
is
said,
has
the
most
eccentric
history
of
any
building
in
Paris.
Built
over
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
temple
to
the
Egyptian
goddess
Isis,
the
church
possesses
an
architectural
footprint
matching
that
of
Notre
Dame
to
within
inches.
The
sanctuary
has
played
host
to
the
baptisms
of
the
Marquis
de
Sade
and
Baudelaire,
as
well
as
the
marriage
of
Victor
Hugo.
The
attached
seminary
has
a
well
documented
history
of
unorthodoxy
and
was
once
the
clandestine
meeting
hall
for
numerous
secret
societies.
Tonight,
the
cavernous
nave
of
Saint
Sulpice
was
as
silent
as
a
tomb,
the
only
hint
of
life
the
faint
smell
of
incense
from
mass
earlier
that
evening.
Silas
sensed
an
uneasiness
in
Sister
Sandrine's
demeanor
as
she
led
him
into
the
sanctuary.
He
was
not
surprised
by
this.
Silas
was
accustomed
to
people
being
uncomfortable
with
his
appearance.
"You're
an
American,"
she
said.
"French
by
birth,"
Silas
responded.
"I
had
my
calling
in
Spain,
and
I
now
study
in
the
United
States."
Sister
Sandrine
nodded.
She
was
a
small
woman
with
quiet
eyes.
"And
you
have
never
seen
Saint
Sulpice?"
"I
realize
this
is
almost
a
sin
in
itself."
"She
is
more
beautiful
by
day."
"I
am
certain.
Nonetheless,
I
am
grateful
that
you
would
provide
me
this
opportunity
tonight."
"The
abbe
requested
it.
You
obviously
have
powerful
friends."
You
have
no
idea,
Silas
thought.
As
he
followed
Sister
Sandrine
down
the
main
aisle,
Silas
was
surprised
by
the
austerity
of
the
sanctuary.
Unlike
Notre
Dame
with
its
colorful
frescoes,
gilded
altar
work,
and
warm
wood,
Saint
Sulpice
was
stark
and
cold,
conveying
an
almost
barren
quality
reminiscent
of
the
ascetic
cathedrals
of
Spain.
The
lack
of
decor
made
the
interior
look
even
more
expansive,
and
as
Silas
gazed
up
into
the
soaring
ribbed
vault
of
the
ceiling,
he
imagined
he
was
standing
beneath
the
hull
of
an
enormous
overturned
ship.
A
fitting
image,
he
thought.
The
brotherhood's
ship
was
about
to
be
capsized
forever.
Feeling
eager
to
get
to
work,
Silas
wished
Sister
Sandrine
would
leave
him.
She
was
a
small
woman
whom
Silas
could
incapacitate
easily,
but
he
had
vowed
not
to
use
force
unless
absolutely
necessary.
She
is
a
woman
of
the
cloth,
and
it
is
not
her
fault
the
brotherhood
chose
her
church
as
a
hiding
place
for
their
keystone.
She
should
not
be
punished
for
the
sins
of
others.
"I
am
embarrassed,
Sister,
that
you
were
awoken
on
my
behalf."
"Not
at
all.
You
are
in
Paris
a
short
time.
You
should
not
miss
Saint
Sulpice.
