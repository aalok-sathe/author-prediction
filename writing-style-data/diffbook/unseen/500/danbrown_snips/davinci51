want
to
be
there
when
we
make
the
arrest."
As
Fache
jogged
back
down
the
length
of
the
Grand
Gallery,
he
wondered
if
Langdon
had
even
survived
the
fall.
Not
that
it
mattered.
Langdon
ran.
Guilty
as
charged.
Only
fifteen
yards
from
the
rest
room,
Langdon
and
Sophie
stood
in
the
darkness
of
the
Grand
Gallery,
their
backs
pressed
to
one
of
the
large
partitions
that
hid
the
bathrooms
from
the
gallery.
They
had
barely
managed
to
hide
themselves
before
Fache
had
darted
past
them,
gun
drawn,
and
disappeared
into
the
bathroom.
The
last
sixty
seconds
had
been
a
blur.
Langdon
had
been
standing
inside
the
men's
room
refusing
to
run
from
a
crime
he
didn't
commit,
when
Sophie
began
eyeing
the
plate
glass
window
and
examining
the
alarm
mesh
running
through
it.
Then
she
peered
downward
into
the
street,
as
if
measuring
the
drop.
"With
a
little
aim,
you
can
get
out
of
here,"
she
said.
Aim?
Uneasy,
he
peered
out
the
rest
room
window.
Up
the
street,
an
enormous
twin
bed
eighteenwheeler
was
headed
for
the
stoplight
beneath
the
window.
Stretched
across
the
truck's
massive
cargo
bay
was
a
blue
vinyl
tarp,
loosely
covering
the
truck's
load.
Langdon
hoped
Sophie
was
not
thinking
what
she
seemed
to
be
thinking.
"Sophie,
there's
no
way
I'm
jump
"Take
out
the
tracking
dot."
Bewildered,
Langdon
fumbled
in
his
pocket
until
he
found
the
tiny
metallic
disk.
Sophie
took
it
from
him
and
strode
immediately
to
the
sink.
She
grabbed
a
thick
bar
of
soap,
placed
the
tracking
dot
on
top
of
it,
and
used
her
thumb
to
push
the
disk
down
hard
into
the
bar.
As
the
disk
sank
into
the
soft
surface,
she
pinched
the
hole
closed,
firmly
embedding
the
device
in
the
bar.
Handing
the
bar
to
Langdon,
Sophie
retrieved
a
heavy,
cylindrical
trash
can
from
under
the
sinks.
Before
Langdon
could
protest,
Sophie
ran
at
the
window,
holding
the
can
before
her
like
a
battering
ram.
Driving
the
bottom
of
the
trash
can
into
the
center
of
the
window,
she
shattered
the
glass.
Alarms
erupted
overhead
at
earsplitting
decibel
levels.
"Give
me
the
soap!"
Sophie
yelled,
barely
audible
over
the
alarm.
Langdon
thrust
the
bar
into
her
hand.
Palming
the
soap,
she
peered
out
the
shattered
window
at
the
eighteen
wheeler
idling
below.
The
target
was
plenty
big
an
expansive,
stationary
tarp
and
it
was
less
than
ten
feet
from
the
side
of
the
building.
As
the
traffic
lights
prepared
to
change,
Sophie
took
a
deep
breath
and
lobbed
the
bar
of
soap
out
into
the
night.
The
soap
plummeted
downward
toward
the
truck,
landing
on
the
edge
of
the
tarp,
and
sliding
downward
into
the
cargo
bay
just
as
the
traffic
light
turned
green.
"Congratulations,"
Sophie
said,
dragging
him
toward
the
door.
"You
just
escaped
from
the
Louvre."
Fleeing
the
men's
room,
they
moved
into
the
shadows
just
as
Fache
rushed
past.
Now,
with
the
fire
alarm
silenced,
Langdon
could
hear
the
sounds
of
DCPJ
sirens
tearing
