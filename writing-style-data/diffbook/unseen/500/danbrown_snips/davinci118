of
the
bank's
small
armored
trucks.
Transport
siir
was
another
service
offered
by
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
"Get
in
the
cargo
hold,"
he
said,
heaving
open
the
massive
rear
door
and
motioning
to
the
glistening
steel
compartment.
"I'll
be
right
back."
As
Sophie
and
Langdon
climbed
in,
Vernet
hurried
across
the
loading
dock
to
the
dock
overseer's
office,
let
himself
in,
collected
the
keys
for
the
truck,
and
found
a
driver's
uniform
jacket
and
cap.
Shedding
his
own
suit
coat
and
tie,
he
began
to
put
on
the
driver's
jacket.
Reconsidering,
he
donned
a
shoulder
holster
beneath
the
uniform.
On
his
way
out,
he
grabbed
a
driver's
pistol
from
the
rack,
put
in
a
clip,
and
stuffed
it
in
the
holster,
buttoning
his
uniform
over
it.
Returning
to
the
truck,
Vernet
pulled
the
driver's
cap
down
low
and
peered
in
at
Sophie
and
Langdon,
who
were
standing
inside
the
empty
steel
box.
"You'll
want
this
on,"
Vernet
said,
reaching
inside
and
flicking
a
wall
switch
to
illuminate
the
lone
courtesy
bulb
on
the
hold's
ceiling.
"And
you'd
better
sit
down.
Not
a
sound
on
our
way
out
the
gate."
Sophie
and
Langdon
sat
down
on
the
metal
floor.
Langdon
cradled
the
treasure
wadded
in
his
tweed
jacket.
Swinging
the
heavy
doors
closed,
Vernet
locked
them
inside.
Then
he
got
in
behind
the
wheel
and
revved
the
engine.
As
the
armored
truck
lumbered
toward
the
top
of
the
ramp,
Vernet
could
feel
the
sweat
already
collecting
beneath
his
driver's
cap.
He
could
see
there
were
far
more
police
lights
in
front
than
he
had
imagined.
As
the
truck
powered
up
the
ramp,
the
interior
gate
swung
inward
to
let
him
pass.
Vernet
advanced
and
waited
while
the
gate
behind
him
closed
before
pulling
forward
and
tripping
the
next
sensor.
The
second
gate
opened,
and
the
exit
beckoned.
Except
for
the
police
car
blocking
the
top
of
the
ramp.
Vernet
dabbed
his
brow
and
pulled
forward.
A
lanky
officer
stepped
out
and
waved
him
to
a
stop
a
few
meters
from
the
roadblock.
Four
patrol
cars
were
parked
out
front.
Vernet
stopped.
Pulling
his
driver's
cap
down
farther,
he
effected
as
rough
a
facade
as
his
cultured
upbringing
would
allow.
Not
budging
from
behind
the
wheel,
he
opened
the
door
and
gazed
down
at
the
agent,
whose
face
was
stern
and
sallow.
"Qu'est
ce
qui
se
passe?"
Vernet
asked,
his
tone
rough.
"Je
suis
Jerome
Collet,
"
the
agent
said.
"Lieutenant
Police
Judiciaire.
"
He
motioned
to
the
truck's
cargo
hold.
"Qu'est
ce
qu'ily
a
la
dedans?"
"Hell
if
I
know,"
Vernet
replied
in
crude
French.
"I'm
only
a
driver."
Collet
looked
unimpressed.
"We're
looking
for
two
criminals."
Vernet
laughed.
"Then
you
came
to
the
right
spot.
Some
of
these
bastards
I
drive
for
have
so
much
money
they
must
be
criminals."
The
agent
held
up
a
passport
picture
of
Robert
Langdon.
"Was
this
man
in
your
bank
tonight?"
Vernet
shrugged.
"No
clue.
I'm
a
dock
rat.
They
don't
let
us
