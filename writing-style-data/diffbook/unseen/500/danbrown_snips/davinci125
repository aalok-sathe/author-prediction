Sophie
translated.
"No,
that's
the
literal
translation.
Clef
de
voiite
is
a
common
architectural
term.
Voiite
refers
not
to
a
bank
vault,
but
to
a
vault
in
an
archway.
Like
a
vaulted
ceiling."
"But
vaulted
ceilings
don't
have
keys."
"Actually
they
do.
Every
stone
archway
requires
a
central,
wedge
shaped
stone
at
the
top
which
locks
the
pieces
together
and
carries
all
the
weight.
This
stone
is,
in
an
architectural
sense,
the
key
to
the
vault.
In
English
we
call
it
a
keystone.
"
Langdon
watched
her
eyes
for
any
spark
of
recognition.
Sophie
shrugged,
glancing
down
at
the
cryptex.
"But
this
obviously
is
not
a
keystone."
Langdon
didn't
know
where
to
begin.
Keystones
as
a
masonry
technique
for
building
stone
archways
had
been
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
of
the
early
Masonic
brotherhood.
The
Royal
Arch
Degree.
Architecture.
Keystones.
It
was
all
interconnected.
The
secret
knowledge
of
how
to
use
a
wedged
keystone
to
build
a
vaulted
archway
was
part
of
the
wisdom
that
had
made
the
Masons
such
wealthy
craftsmen,
and
it
was
a
secret
they
guarded
carefully.
Keystones
had
always
had
a
tradition
of
secrecy.
And
yet,
the
stone
cylinder
in
the
rosewood
box
was
obviously
something
quite
different.
The
Priory
keystone
if
this
was
indeed
what
they
were
holding
was
not
at
all
what
Langdon
had
imagined.
"The
Priory
keystone
is
not
my
specialty,"
Langdon
admitted.
"My
interest
in
the
Holy
Grail
is
primarily
symbologic,
so
I
tend
to
ignore
the
plethora
of
lore
regarding
how
to
actually
find
it."
Sophie's
eyebrows
arched.
"Find
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
gave
an
uneasy
nod,
speaking
his
next
words
carefully.
"Sophie,
according
to
Priory
lore,
the
keystone
is
an
encoded
map
a
map
that
reveals
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Sophie's
face
went
blank.
"And
you
think
this
is
it?"
Langdon
didn't
know
what
to
say.
Even
to
him
it
sounded
unbelievable,
and
yet
the
keystone
was
the
only
logical
conclusion
he
could
muster.
An
encrypted
stone,
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
The
idea
that
the
cryptex
had
been
designed
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci
former
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
shone
as
another
tantalizing
indicator
that
this
was
indeed
the
Priory
keystone.
A
former
Grand
Master's
blueprint
brought
to
life
centuries
later
by
another
Priory
member.
The
bond
was
too
palpable
to
dismiss.
For
the
last
decade,
historians
had
been
searching
for
the
keystone
in
French
churches.
Grail
seekers,
familiar
with
the
Priory's
history
of
cryptic
double
talk,
had
concluded
la
clef
de
voute
was
a
literal
keystone
an
architectural
wedge
an
engraved,
encrypted
stone,
inserted
into
a
vaulted
archway
in
a
church.
Beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
In
architecture,
there
was
no
shortage
of
roses.
Rose
windows.
Rosette
reliefs.
And,
of
course,
an
abundance
of
cinquefoils
the
five
petaled
decorative
flowers
often
found
at
the
top
of
archways,
directly
over
the
keystone.
The
hiding
place
seemed
diabolically
simple.
The
map
to
the
Holy
Grail
was
incorporated
high
in
an
archway
