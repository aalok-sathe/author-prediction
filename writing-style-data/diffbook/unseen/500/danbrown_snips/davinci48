that
made
his
case
stronger."
"Exactly.
Like
running!"
The
cell
phone
in
Sophie's
sweater
pocket
suddenly
began
ringing.
Fache
probably.
She
reached
in
her
sweater
and
turned
off
the
phone.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
she
said
hurriedly,
"I
need
to
ask
you
one
last
question."
And
your
entire
future
may
depend
on
it.
"The
writing
on
the
floor
is
obviously
not
proof
of
your
guilt,
and
yet
Fache
told
our
team
he
is
certain
you
are
his
man.
Can
you
think
of
any
other
reason
he
might
be
convinced
you're
guilty?"
Langdon
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"None
whatsoever."
Sophie
sighed.
Which
means
Fache
is
lying.
Why,
Sophie
could
not
begin
to
imagine,
but
that
was
hardly
the
issue
at
this
point.
The
fact
remained
that
Bezu
Fache
was
determined
to
put
Robert
Langdon
behind
bars
tonight,
at
any
cost.
Sophie
needed
Langdon
for
herself,
and
it
was
this
dilemma
that
left
Sophie
only
one
logical
conclusion.
need
to
get
Langdon
to
the
U.S.
Embassy.
Turning
toward
the
window,
Sophie
gazed
through
the
alarm
mesh
embedded
in
the
plate
glass,
down
the
dizzying
forty
feet
to
the
pavement
below.
A
leap
from
this
height
would
leave
Langdon
with
a
couple
of
broken
legs.
At
best.
Nonetheless,
Sophie
made
her
decision.
Robert
Langdon
was
about
to
escape
the
Louvre,
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not.
"What
do
you
mean
she's
not
answering?"
Fache
looked
incredulous.
"You're
calling
her
cell
phone,
right?
I
know
she's
carrying
it."
Collet
had
been
trying
to
reach
Sophie
now
for
several
minutes.
"Maybe
her
batteries
are
dead.
Or
her
ringer's
off."
Fache
had
looked
distressed
ever
since
talking
to
the
director
of
Cryptology
on
the
phone.
After
hanging
up,
he
had
marched
over
to
Collet
and
demanded
he
get
Agent
Neveu
on
the
line.
Now
Collet
had
failed,
and
Fache
was
pacing
like
a
caged
lion.
"Why
did
Crypto
call?"
Collet
now
ventured.
Fache
turned.
"To
tell
us
they
found
no
references
to
Draconian
devils
and
lame
saints."
"That's
all?"
"No,
also
to
tell
us
that
they
had
just
identified
the
numerics
as
Fibonacci
numbers,
but
they
suspected
the
series
was
meaningless."
Collet
was
confused.
"But
they
already
sent
Agent
Neveu
to
tell
us
that."
Fache
shook
his
head.
"They
didn't
send
Neveu."
"What?"
"According
to
the
director,
at
my
orders
he
paged
his
entire
team
to
look
at
the
images
I'd
wired
him.
When
Agent
Neveu
arrived,
she
took
one
look
at
the
photos
of
Sauniere
and
the
code
and
left
the
office
without
a
word.
The
director
said
he
didn't
question
her
behavior
because
she
was
understandably
upset
by
the
photos."
"Upset?
She's
never
seen
a
picture
of
a
dead
body?"
Fache
was
silent
a
moment.
"I
was
not
aware
of
this,
and
it
seems
neither
was
the
director
until
a
coworker
informed
him,
but
apparently
Sophie
Neveu
is
Jacques
Sauniere's
granddaughter."
Collet
was
speechless.
"The
director
said
she
never
once
mentioned
Sauniere
to
him,
and
he
assumed
it
was
because
she
probably
didn't
want
