place
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
actually
a
tomb?"
Teabing's
hazel
eyes
got
misty.
"It
is.
A
tomb
containing
the
body
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
documents
that
tell
the
true
story
of
her
life.
At
its
heart,
the
quest
for
the
Holy
Grail
has
always
been
a
quest
for
the
Magdalene
the
wronged
Queen,
entombed
with
proof
of
her
family's
rightful
claim
to
power.
Sophie
waited
a
moment
as
Teabing
gathered
himself.
So
much
about
her
grandfather
was
still
not
making
sense.
"Members
of
the
Priory,"
she
finally
said,
"all
these
years
have
answered
the
charge
of
protecting
the
Sangreal
documents
and
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene?"
"Yes,
but
the
brotherhood
had
another,
more
important
duty
as
well
to
protect
the
bloodline
itself.
Christ's
lineage
was
in
perpetual
danger.
The
early
Church
feared
that
if
the
lineage
were
permitted
to
grow,
the
secret
of
Jesus
and
Magdalene
would
eventually
surface
and
challenge
the
fundamental
Catholic
doctrine
that
of
a
divine
Messiah
who
did
not
consort
with
women
or
engage
in
sexual
union."
He
paused.
"Nonetheless,
Christ's
line
grew
quietly
under
cover
in
France
until
making
a
bold
move
in
the
fifth
century,
when
it
intermarried
with
French
royal
blood
and
created
a
lineage
known
as
the
Merovingian
bloodline.
This
news
surprised
Sophie.
Merovingian
was
a
term
learned
by
every
student
in
France.
"The
Merovingians
founded
Paris."
"Yes.
That's
one
of
the
reasons
the
Grail
legend
is
so
rich
in
France.
Many
of
the
Vatican's
Grail
quests
here
were
in
fact
stealth
missions
to
erase
members
of
the
royal
bloodline.
Have
you
heard
of
King
Dagobert?"
Sophie
vaguely
recalled
the
name
from
a
grisly
tale
in
history
class.
"Dagobert
was
a
Merovingian
king,
wasn't
he?
Stabbed
in
the
eye
while
sleeping?"
"Exactly.
Assassinated
by
the
Vatican
in
collusion
with
Pepin
d'Heristal.
Late
seventh
century.
With
Dagobert's
murder,
the
Merovingian
bloodline
was
almost
exterminated.
Fortunately,
Dagobert's
son,
Sigisbert,
secretly
escaped
the
attack
and
carried
on
the
lineage,
which
later
included
Godefroi
de
Bouillon
founder
of
the
Priory
of
Sion."
"The
same
man,"
Langdon
said,
"who
ordered
the
Knights
Templar
to
recover
the
Sangreal
documents
from
beneath
Solomon's
Temple
and
thus
provide
the
Merovingians
proof
of
their
hereditary
ties
to
Jesus
Christ."
Teabing
nodded,
heaving
a
ponderous
sigh.
"The
modern
Priory
of
Sion
has
a
momentous
duty.
Theirs
is
a
threefold
charge.
The
brotherhood
must
protect
the
Sangreal
documents.
They
must
protect
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene.
And,
of
course,
they
must
nurture
and
protect
the
bloodline
of
Christ
those
few
members
of
the
royal
Merovingian
bloodline
who
have
survived
into
modern
times."
The
words
hung
in
the
huge
space,
and
Sophie
felt
an
odd
vibration,
as
if
her
bones
were
reverberating
with
some
new
kind
of
truth.
Descendants
of
Jesus
who
survived
into
modern
times.
Her
grandfather's
voice
again
was
whispering
in
her
ear.
Princess,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family.
A
chill
raked
her
flesh.
Royal
blood.
She
could
not
imagine.
Princess
Sophie.
"Sir
Leigh?"
The
manservant's
