the
circumstances,
Teabing
would
probably
trip
over
himself
to
help
them
as
much
as
possible.
Not
only
did
he
owe
Langdon
a
favor,
but
Teabing
was
a
Grail
researcher,
and
Sophie
claimed
her
grandfather
was
the
actual
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion.
If
Teabing
heard
that,
he
would
salivate
at
the
thought
of
helping
them
figure
this
out.
"Teabing
could
be
a
powerful
ally,"
Langdon
said.
Depending
on
how
much
you
want
to
tell
him.
"Fache
probably
will
be
offering
a
monetary
reward."
Langdon
laughed.
"Believe
me,
money
is
the
last
thing
this
guy
needs."
Leigh
Teabing
was
wealthy
in
the
way
small
countries
were
wealthy.
A
descendant
of
Britain's
First
Duke
of
Lancaster,
Teabing
had
gotten
his
money
the
old
fashioned
way
he'd
inherited
it.
His
estate
outside
of
Paris
was
a
seventeenth
century
palace
with
two
private
lakes.
Langdon
had
first
met
Teabing
several
years
ago
through
the
British
Broadcasting
Corporation.
Teabing
had
approached
the
BBC
with
a
proposal
for
a
historical
documentary
in
which
he
would
expose
the
explosive
history
of
the
Holy
Grail
to
a
mainstream
television
audience.
The
BBC
producers
loved
Teabing's
hot
premise,
his
research,
and
his
credentials,
but
they
had
concerns
that
the
concept
was
so
shocking
and
hard
to
swallow
that
the
network
might
end
up
tarnishing
its
reputation
for
quality
journalism.
At
Teabing's
suggestion,
the
BBC
solved
its
credibility
fears
by
soliciting
three
cameos
from
respected
historians
from
around
the
world,
all
of
whom
corroborated
the
stunning
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail
secret
with
their
own
research.
Langdon
had
been
among
those
chosen.
The
BBC
had
flown
Langdon
to
Teabing's
Paris
estate
for
the
filming.
He
sat
before
cameras
in
Teabing's
opulent
drawing
room
and
shared
his
story,
admitting
his
initial
skepticism
on
hearing
of
the
alternate
Holy
Grail
story,
then
describing
how
years
of
research
had
persuaded
him
that
the
story
was
true.
Finally,
Langdon
offered
some
of
his
own
research
a
series
of
symbologic
connections
that
strongly
supported
the
seemingly
controversial
claims.
When
the
program
aired
in
Britain,
despite
its
ensemble
cast
and
well
documented
evidence,
the
premise
rubbed
so
hard
against
the
grain
of
popular
Christian
thought
that
it
instantly
confronted
a
firestorm
of
hostility.
It
never
aired
in
the
States,
but
the
repercussions
echoed
across
the
Atlantic.
Shortly
afterward,
Langdon
received
a
postcard
from
an
old
friend
the
Catholic
Bishop
of
Philadelphia.
The
card
simply
read:
Et
tu,
Robert?
"Robert,"
Sophie
asked,
"you're
certain
we
can
trust
this
man?"
"Absolutely.
We're
colleagues,
he
doesn't
need
money,
and
I
happen
to
know
he
despises
the
French
authorities.
The
French
government
taxes
him
at
absurd
rates
because
he
bought
a
historic
landmark.
He'll
be
in
no
hurry
to
cooperate
with
Fache."
Sophie
stared
out
at
the
dark
roadway.
"If
we
go
to
him,
how
much
do
you
want
to
tell
him?"
Langdon
looked
unconcerned.
"Believe
me,
Leigh
Teabing
knows
more
about
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
the
Holy
Grail
than
anyone
on
earth.
Sophie
eyed
him.
