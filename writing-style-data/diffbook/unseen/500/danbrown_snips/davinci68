your
secret
initials."
Her
eyes
went
wide.
"I
have
secret
initials?"
"Of
course.
Granddaughters
always
have
secret
initials
that
only
their
grandfathers
know."
"PS.?"
He
tickled
her.
"Princesse
Sophie.
She
giggled.
"I'm
not
a
princess!"
He
winked.
"You
are
to
me."
From
that
day
on,
they
never
again
spoke
of
the
key.
And
she
became
his
Princess
Sophie.
Inside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Sophie
stood
in
silence
and
endured
the
sharp
pang
of
loss.
"The
initials,"
Langdon
whispered,
eyeing
her
strangely.
"Have
you
seen
them?"
Sophie
sensed
her
grandfather's
voice
whispering
in
the
corridors
of
the
museum.
Never
speak
of
this
key,
Sophie.
To
me
or
to
anyone.
She
knew
she
had
failed
him
in
forgiveness,
and
she
wondered
if
she
could
break
his
trust
again.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Her
grandfather
wanted
Langdon
to
help.
Sophie
nodded.
"Yes,
I
saw
the
initials
P.S.
once.
When
I
was
very
young."
"Where?"
Sophie
hesitated.
"On
something
very
important
to
him."
Langdon
locked
eyes
with
her.
"Sophie,
this
is
crucial.
Can
you
tell
me
if
the
initials
appeared
with
a
symbol?
A
fleur
de
lis?"
Sophie
felt
herself
staggering
backward
in
amazement.
"But
how
could
you
possibly
know
that!"
Langdon
exhaled
and
lowered
his
voice.
"I'm
fairly
certain
your
grandfather
was
a
member
of
a
secret
society.
A
very
old
covert
brotherhood."
Sophie
felt
a
knot
tighten
in
her
stomach.
She
was
certain
of
it
too.
For
ten
years
she
had
tried
to
forget
the
incident
that
had
confirmed
that
horrifying
fact
for
her.
She
had
witnessed
something
unthinkable.
Unforgivable.
"The
fleur
de
lis,"
Langdon
said,
"combined
with
the
initials
P.S.,
that
is
the
brotherhood's
official
device.
Their
coat
of
arms.
Their
logo."
"How
do
you
know
this?"
Sophie
was
praying
Langdon
was
not
going
to
tell
her
that
he
himself
was
a
member.
"I've
written
about
this
group,"
he
said,
his
voice
tremulous
with
excitement.
"Researching
the
symbols
of
secret
societies
is
a
specialty
of
mine.
They
call
themselves
the
Prieure
de
Sion
the
Priory
of
Sion.
They're
based
here
in
France
and
attract
powerful
members
from
all
over
Europe.
In
fact,
they
are
one
of
the
oldest
surviving
secret
societies
on
earth.
Sophie
had
never
heard
of
them.
Langdon
was
talking
in
rapid
bursts
now.
"The
Priory's
membership
has
included
some
of
history's
most
cultured
individuals:
men
like
Botticelli,
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
Victor
Hugo."
He
paused,
his
voice
brimming
now
with
academic
zeal.
"And,
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Sophie
stared.
"Da
Vinci
was
in
a
secret
society?"
"Da
Vinci
presided
over
the
Priory
between
1510
and
1519
as
the
brotherhood's
Grand
Master,
which
might
help
explain
your
grandfather's
passion
for
Leonardo's
work.
The
two
men
share
a
historical
fraternal
bond.
And
it
all
fits
perfectly
with
their
fascination
for
goddess
iconology,
paganism,
feminine
deities,
and
contempt
for
the
Church.
The
Priory
has
a
well
documented
history
of
reverence
for
the
sacred
feminine."
"You're
telling
me
this
group
is
a
pagan
goddess
worship
cult?"
"More
like
the
pagan
goddess
worship
cult.
But
