been
wondering
the
same
thing
ever
since
he
first
saw
the
Polaroid.
His
best
guess
was
that
a
naked
human
form
was
yet
another
endorsement
of
Venus
the
goddess
of
human
sexuality.
Although
modern
culture
had
erased
much
of
Venus's
association
with
the
malefemale
physical
union,
a
sharp
etymological
eye
could
still
spot
a
vestige
of
Venus's
original
meaning
in
the
word
"venereal."
Langdon
decided
not
to
go
there.
"Mr.
Fache,
I
obviously
can't
tell
you
why
Mr.
Sauniere
drew
that
symbol
on
himself
or
placed
himself
in
this
way,
but
I
can
tell
you
that
a
man
like
Jacques
Sauniere
would
consider
the
pentacle
a
sign
of
the
female
deity.
The
correlation
between
this
symbol
and
the
sacred
feminine
is
widely
known
by
art
historians
and
symbologists."
"Fine.
And
the
use
of
his
own
blood
as
ink?"
"Obviously
he
had
nothing
else
to
write
with."
Fache
was
silent
a
moment.
"Actually,
I
believe
he
used
blood
such
that
the
police
would
follow
certain
forensic
procedures."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Look
at
his
left
hand."
Langdon's
eyes
traced
the
length
of
the
curator's
pale
arm
to
his
left
hand
but
saw
nothing.
Uncertain,
he
circled
the
corpse
and
crouched
down,
now
noting
with
surprise
that
the
curator
was
clutching
a
large,
felt
tipped
marker.
"Sauniere
was
holding
it
when
we
found
him,"
Fache
said,
leaving
Langdon
and
moving
several
yards
to
a
portable
table
covered
with
investigation
tools,
cables,
and
assorted
electronic
gear.
"As
I
told
you,"
he
said,
rummaging
around
the
table,
"we
have
touched
nothing.
Are
you
familiar
with
this
kind
of
pen?"
Langdon
knelt
down
farther
to
see
the
pen's
label.
STYLO
DE
LUMIERE
NOIRE.
He
glanced
up
in
surprise.
The
black
light
pen
or
watermark
stylus
was
a
specialized
felt
tipped
marker
originally
designed
by
museums,
restorers,
and
forgery
police
to
place
invisible
marks
on
items.
The
stylus
wrote
in
a
noncorrosive,
alcohol
based
fluorescent
ink
that
was
visible
only
under
black
light.
Nowadays,
museum
maintenance
staffs
carried
these
markers
on
their
daily
rounds
to
place
invisible
"tick
marks"
on
the
frames
of
paintings
that
needed
restoration.
As
Langdon
stood
up,
Fache
walked
over
to
the
spotlight
and
turned
it
off.
The
gallery
plunged
into
sudden
darkness.
Momentarily
blinded,
Langdon
felt
a
rising
uncertainty.
Fache's
silhouette
appeared,
illuminated
in
bright
purple.
He
approached
carrying
a
portable
light
source,
which
shrouded
him
in
a
violet
haze.
"As
you
may
know,"
Fache
said,
his
eyes
luminescing
in
the
violet
glow,
"police
use
black
light
illumination
to
search
crime
scenes
for
blood
and
other
forensic
evidence.
So
you
can
imagine
our
surprise"
Abruptly,
he
pointed
the
light
down
at
the
corpse.
Langdon
looked
down
and
jumped
back
in
shock.
His
heart
pounded
as
he
took
in
the
bizarre
sight
now
glowing
before
him
on
the
parquet
floor.
Scrawled
in
luminescent
handwriting,
the
curator's
final
words
glowed
purple
beside
his
corpse.
As
Langdon
stared
at
the
shimmering
text,
he
felt
the
fog
that
had
surrounded
this
entire
night
growing
thicker.
