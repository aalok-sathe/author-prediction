another.
Can
you
imagine
the
four
chests
of
Sangreal
documents
sitting
right
here
with
Mary
Magdalene's
sarcophagus?
It
gives
me
gooseflesh."
Langdon
was
feeling
gooseflesh
too
as
they
stepped
into
the
circular
chamber.
His
eye
traced
the
curvature
of
the
chamber's
pale
stone
perimeter,
taking
in
the
carvings
of
gargoyles,
demons,
monsters,
and
pained
human
faces,
all
staring
inward.
Beneath
the
carvings,
a
single
stone
pew
curled
around
the
entire
circumference
of
the
room.
"Theater
in
the
round,"
Langdon
whispered.
Teabing
raised
a
crutch,
pointing
toward
the
far
left
of
the
room
and
then
to
the
far
right.
Langdon
had
already
seen
them.
Ten
stone
knights.
Five
on
the
left.
Five
on
the
right.
Lying
prone
on
the
floor,
the
carved,
life
sized
figures
rested
in
peaceful
poses.
The
knights
were
depicted
wearing
full
armor,
shields,
and
swords,
and
the
tombs
gave
Langdon
the
uneasy
sensation
that
someone
had
snuck
in
and
poured
plaster
over
the
knights
while
they
were
sleeping.
All
of
the
figures
were
deeply
weathered,
and
yet
each
was
clearly
unique
different
armory
pieces,
distinct
leg
and
arm
positions,
facial
features,
and
markings
on
their
shields.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
Langdon
felt
shaky
as
he
inched
deeper
into
the
circular
room.
This
had
to
be
the
place.
In
a
rubbish
strewn
alley
very
close
to
Temple
Church,
Remy
Legaludec
pulled
the
Jaguar
limousine
to
a
stop
behind
a
row
of
industrial
waste
bins.
Killing
the
engine,
he
checked
the
area.
Deserted.
He
got
out
of
the
car,
walked
toward
the
rear,
and
climbed
back
into
the
limousine's
main
cabin
where
the
monk
was.
Sensing
Remy's
presence,
the
monk
in
the
back
emerged
from
a
prayer
like
trance,
his
red
eyes
looking
more
curious
than
fearful.
All
evening
Remy
had
been
impressed
with
this
trussed
man's
ability
to
stay
calm.
After
some
initial
struggles
in
the
Range
Rover,
the
monk
seemed
to
have
accepted
his
plight
and
given
over
his
fate
to
a
higher
power.
Loosening
his
bow
tie,
Remy
unbuttoned
his
high,
starched,
wing
tipped
collar
and
felt
as
if
he
could
breathe
for
the
first
time
in
years.
He
went
to
the
limousine's
wet
bar,
where
he
poured
himself
a
Smirnoff
vodka.
He
drank
it
in
a
single
swallow
and
followed
it
with
a
second.
Soon
I
will
be
a
man
of
leisure.
Searching
the
bar,
Remy
found
a
standard
service
wine
opener
and
flicked
open
the
sharp
blade.
The
knife
was
usually
employed
to
slice
the
lead
foil
from
corks
on
fine
bottles
of
wine,
but
it
would
serve
a
far
more
dramatic
purpose
this
morning.
Remy
turned
and
faced
Silas,
holding
up
the
glimmering
blade.
Now
those
red
eyes
flashed
fear.
Remy
smiled
and
moved
toward
the
back
of
the
limousine.
The
monk
recoiled,
struggling
against
his
bonds.
"Be
still,"
Remy
whispered,
raising
the
blade.
Silas
could
not
believe
that
God
had
forsaken
him.
Even
the
physical
pain
of
being
bound
Silas
had
turned
into
a
spiritual
exercise,
asking
the
