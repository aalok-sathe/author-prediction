lined
diplomatic
neighborhood.
The
embassy
was
less
than
a
mile
away
now.
She
was
finally
feeling
like
she
could
breathe
normally
again.
Even
as
she
drove,
Sophie's
mind
remained
locked
on
the
key
in
her
pocket,
her
memories
of
seeing
it
many
years
ago,
the
gold
head
shaped
as
an
equal
armed
cross,
the
triangular
shaft,
the
indentations,
the
embossed
flowery
seal,
and
the
letters
P.S.
Although
the
key
barely
had
entered
Sophie's
thoughts
through
the
years,
her
work
in
the
intelligence
community
had
taught
her
plenty
about
security,
and
now
the
key's
peculiar
tooling
no
longer
looked
so
mystifying.
A
laser
tooled
varying
matrix.
Impossible
to
duplicate.
Rather
than
teeth
that
moved
tumblers,
this
key's
complex
series
of
laser
burned
pockmarks
was
examined
by
an
electric
eye.
If
the
eye
determined
that
the
hexagonal
pockmarks
were
correctly
spaced,
arranged,
and
rotated,
then
the
lock
would
open.
Sophie
could
not
begin
to
imagine
what
a
key
like
this
opened,
but
she
sensed
Robert
would
be
able
to
tell
her.
After
all,
he
had
described
the
key's
embossed
seal
without
ever
seeing
it.
The
cruciform
on
top
implied
the
key
belonged
to
some
kind
of
Christian
organization,
and
yet
Sophie
knew
of
no
churches
that
used
laser
tooled
varying
matrix
keys.
Besides,
my
grandfather
was
no
Christian.
Sophie
had
witnessed
proof
of
that
ten
years
ago.
Ironically,
it
had
been
another
key
a
far
more
normal
one
that
had
revealed
his
true
nature
to
her.
The
afternoon
had
been
warm
when
she
landed
at
Charles
de
Gaulle
Airport
and
hailed
a
taxi
home.
Grand
pere
will
be
so
surprised
to
see
me,
she
thought.
Returning
from
graduate
school
in
Britain
for
spring
break
a
few
days
early,
Sophie
couldn't
wait
to
see
him
and
tell
him
all
about
the
encryption
methods
she
was
studying.
When
she
arrived
at
their
Paris
home,
however,
her
grandfather
was
not
there.
Disappointed,
she
knew
he
had
not
been
expecting
her
and
was
probably
working
at
the
Louvre.
But
it's
Saturday
afternoon,
she
realized.
He
seldom
worked
on
weekends.
On
weekends,
he
usually
Grinning,
Sophie
ran
out
to
the
garage.
Sure
enough,
his
car
was
gone.
It
was
the
weekend.
Jacques
Sauniere
despised
city
driving
and
owned
a
car
for
one
destination
only
his
vacation
chateau
in
Normandy,
north
of
Paris.
Sophie,
after
months
in
the
congestion
of
London,
was
eager
for
the
smells
of
nature
and
to
start
her
vacation
right
away.
It
was
still
early
evening,
and
she
decided
to
leave
immediately
and
surprise
him.
Borrowing
a
friend's
car,
Sophie
drove
north,
winding
into
the
deserted
moon
swept
hills
near
Creully.
She
arrived
just
after
ten
o'clock,
turning
down
the
long
private
driveway
toward
her
grandfather's
retreat.
The
access
road
was
over
a
mile
long,
and
she
was
halfway
down
it
before
she
could
start
to
see
the
house
through
the
trees
a
mammoth,
old
stone
chateau
nestled
in
the
woods
on
the
side
of
a
hill.
Sophie
had
half
expected
to
find
