reported
to
the
police
that
your
brother
and
I
had
been
in
the
car
our
two
bodies
apparently
washed
off
in
the
current.
Then
your
brother
and
I
went
underground
with
the
Priory.
Jacques,
being
a
man
of
prominence,
did
not
have
the
luxury
of
disappearing.
It
only
made
sense
that
Sophie,
being
the
eldest,
would
stay
in
Paris
to
be
taught
and
raised
by
Jacques,
close
to
the
heart
and
protection
of
the
Priory."
Her
voice
fell
to
a
whisper.
"Separating
the
family
was
the
hardest
thing
we
ever
had
to
do.
Jacques
and
I
saw
each
other
only
very
infrequently,
and
always
in
the
most
secret
of
settings
under
the
protection
of
the
Priory.
There
are
certain
ceremonies
to
which
the
brotherhood
always
stays
faithful."
Langdon
had
sensed
the
story
went
far
deeper,
but
he
also
sensed
it
was
not
for
him
to
hear.
So
he
had
stepped
outside.
Now,
gazing
up
at
the
spires
of
Rosslyn,
Langdon
could
not
escape
the
hollow
gnaw
of
Rosslyn's
unsolved
mystery.
Is
the
Grail
really
here
at
Rosslyn?
And
if
so,
where
are
the
blade
and
chalice
that
Sauniere
mentioned
in
his
poem?
"I'll
take
that,"
Marie
said,
motioning
to
Langdon's
hand.
"Oh,
thank
you."
Langdon
held
out
his
empty
coffee
cup.
She
stared
at
him.
"I
was
referring
to
your
other
hand,
Mr.
Langdon."
Langdon
looked
down
and
realized
he
was
holding
Sauniere's
papyrus.
He
had
taken
it
from
the
cryptex
once
again
in
hopes
of
seeing
something
he
had
missed
earlier.
"Of
course,
I'm
sorry."
Marie
looked
amused
as
she
took
the
paper.
"I
know
of
a
man
at
a
bank
in
Paris
who
is
probably
very
eager
to
see
the
return
of
this
rosewood
box.
Andre
Vernet
was
a
dear
friend
of
Jacques,
and
Jacques
trusted
him
explicitly.
Andre
would
have
done
anything
to
honor
Jacques's
requests
for
the
care
of
this
box."
Including
shooting
me,
Langdon
recalled,
deciding
not
to
mention
that
he
had
probably
broken
the
poor
man's
nose.
Thinking
of
Paris,
Langdon
flashed
on
the
three
senechaux
who
had
been
killed
the
night
before.
"And
the
Priory?
What
happens
now?"
"The
wheels
are
already
in
motion,
Mr.
Langdon.
The
brotherhood
has
endured
for
centuries,
and
it
will
endure
this.
There
are
always
those
waiting
to
move
up
and
rebuild."
All
evening
Langdon
had
suspected
that
Sophie's
grandmother
was
closely
tied
to
the
operations
of
the
Priory.
After
all,
the
Priory
had
always
had
women
members.
Four
Grand
Masters
had
been
women.
The
senechaux
were
traditionally
men
the
guardians
and
yet
women
held
far
more
honored
status
within
the
Priory
and
could
ascend
to
the
highest
post
from
virtually
any
rank.
Langdon
thought
of
Leigh
Teabing
and
Westminster
Abbey.
It
seemed
a
lifetime
ago.
"Was
the
Church
pressuring
your
husband
not
to
release
the
Sangreal
documents
at
the
End
of
Days?"
"Heavens
no.
The
End
of
Days
is
a
legend
of
paranoid
minds.
There
is
nothing
in
the
Priory
doctrine
that
identifies
a
date
at
which
