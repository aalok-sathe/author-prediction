calling
Interpol."
Collet
looked
surprised.
"You're
putting
this
on
the
wire?"
Fache
regretted
the
potential
embarrassment,
but
he
saw
no
other
choice.
Close
the
net
fast,
and
close
it
tight.
The
first
hour
was
critical.
Fugitives
were
predictable
the
first
hour
after
escape.
They
always
needed
the
same
thing.
Travel.
Lodging.
Cash.
The
Holy
Trinity.
Interpol
had
the
power
to
make
all
three
disappear
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
By
broadcast
faxing
photos
of
Langdon
and
Sophie
to
Paris
travel
authorities,
hotels,
and
banks,
Interpol
would
leave
no
options
no
way
to
leave
the
city,
no
place
to
hide,
and
no
way
to
withdraw
cash
without
being
recognized.
Usually,
fugitives
panicked
on
the
street
and
did
something
stupid.
Stole
a
car.
Robbed
a
store.
Used
a
bank
card
in
desperation.
Whatever
mistake
they
committed,
they
quickly
made
their
whereabouts
known
to
local
authorities.
"Only
Langdon,
right?"
Collet
said.
"You're
not
flagging
Sophie
Neveu.
She's
our
own
agent."
"Of
course
I'm
flagging
her!"
Fache
snapped.
"What
good
is
flagging
Langdon
if
she
can
do
all
his
dirty
work?
I
plan
to
run
Neveu's
employment
file
friends,
family,
personal
contacts
anyone
she
might
turn
to
for
help.
I
don't
know
what
she
thinks
she's
doing
out
there,
but
it's
going
to
cost
her
one
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
her
job!"
"Do
you
want
me
on
the
phones
or
in
the
field?"
"Field.
Get
over
to
the
train
station
and
coordinate
the
team.
You've
got
the
reins,
but
don't
make
a
move
without
talking
to
me."
"Yes,
sir."
Collet
ran
out.
Fache
felt
rigid
as
he
stood
in
the
alcove.
Outside
the
window,
the
glass
pyramid
shone,
its
reflection
rippling
in
the
windswept
pools.
They
slipped
through
my
fingers.
He
told
himself
to
relax.
Even
a
trained
field
agent
would
be
lucky
to
withstand
the
pressure
that
Interpol
was
about
to
apply.
A
female
cryptologist
and
a
schoolteacher?
They
wouldn't
last
till
dawn.
The
heavily
forested
park
known
as
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
was
called
many
things,
but
the
Parisian
cognoscenti
knew
it
as
"the
Garden
of
Earthly
Delights."
The
epithet,
despite
sounding
flattering,
was
quite
to
the
contrary.
Anyone
who
had
seen
the
lurid
Bosch
painting
of
the
same
name
understood
the
jab;
the
painting,
like
the
forest,
was
dark
and
twisted,
a
purgatory
for
freaks
and
fetishists.
At
night,
the
forest's
winding
lanes
were
lined
with
hundreds
of
glistening
bodies
for
hire,
earthly
delights
to
satisfy
one's
deepest
unspoken
desires
male,
female,
and
everything
in
between.
As
Langdon
gathered
his
thoughts
to
tell
Sophie
about
the
Priory
of
Sion,
their
taxi
passed
through
the
wooded
entrance
to
the
park
and
began
heading
west
on
the
cobblestone
crossfare.
Langdon
was
having
trouble
concentrating
as
a
scattering
of
the
park's
nocturnal
residents
were
already
emerging
from
the
shadows
and
flaunting
their
wares
in
the
glare
of
the
headlights.
Ahead,
two
topless
teenage
girls
shot
smoldering
gazes
into
the
taxi.
Beyond
them,
a
well
oiled
black
man
in
a
G
string
