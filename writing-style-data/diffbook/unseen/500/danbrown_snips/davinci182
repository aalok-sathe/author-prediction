I
would
not
trust
anyone
who
stepped
forward
from
the
brotherhood
at
this
point."
"So
what
do
you
suggest?"
Langdon
asked.
"Robert,
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
the
Priory
has
not
protected
the
truth
all
these
years
to
have
it
gather
dust
until
eternity.
They
have
been
waiting
for
the
right
moment
in
history
to
share
their
secret.
A
time
when
the
world
is
ready
to
handle
the
truth."
"And
you
believe
that
moment
has
arrived?"
Langdon
asked.
"Absolutely.
It
could
not
be
more
obvious.
All
the
historical
signs
are
in
place,
and
if
the
Priory
did
not
intend
to
make
their
secret
known
very
soon,
why
has
the
Church
now
attacked?"
Sophie
argued,
"The
monk
has
not
yet
told
us
his
purpose."
"The
monk's
purpose
is
the
Church's
purpose,"
Teabing
replied,
"to
destroy
the
documents
that
reveal
the
great
deception.
The
Church
came
closer
tonight
than
they
have
ever
come,
and
the
Priory
has
put
its
trust
in
you,
Miss
Neveu.
The
task
of
saving
the
Holy
Grail
clearly
includes
carrying
out
the
Priory's
final
wishes
of
sharing
the
truth
with
the
world.
Langdon
intervened.
"Leigh,
asking
Sophie
to
make
that
decision
is
quite
a
load
to
drop
on
someone
who
only
an
hour
ago
learned
the
Sangreal
documents
exist."
Teabing
sighed.
"I
apologize
if
I
am
pressing,
Miss
Neveu.
Clearly
I
have
always
believed
these
documents
should
be
made
public,
but
in
the
end
the
decision
belongs
to
you.
I
simply
feel
it
is
important
that
you
begin
to
think
about
what
happens
should
we
succeed
in
opening
the
keystone."
"Gentlemen,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
firm.
"To
quote
your
words,
'You
do
not
find
the
Grail,
the
Grail
finds
you.'
I
am
going
to
trust
that
the
Grail
has
found
me
for
a
reason,
and
when
the
time
comes,
I
will
know
what
to
do."
Both
of
them
looked
startled.
"So
then,"
she
said,
motioning
to
the
rosewood
box.
"Let's
move
on.
Standing
in
the
drawing
room
of
Chateau
Villette,
Lieutenant
Collet
watched
the
dying
fire
and
felt
despondent.
Captain
Fache
had
arrived
moments
earlier
and
was
now
in
the
next
room,
yelling
into
the
phone,
trying
to
coordinate
the
failed
attempt
to
locate
the
missing
Range
Rover.
It
could
be
anywhere
by
now,
Collet
thought.
Having
disobeyed
Fache's
direct
orders
and
lost
Langdon
for
a
second
time,
Collet
was
grateful
that
PTS
had
located
a
bullet
hole
in
the
floor,
which
at
least
corroborated
Collet's
claims
that
a
shot
had
been
fired.
Still,
Fache's
mood
was
sour,
and
Collet
sensed
there
would
be
dire
repercussions
when
the
dust
settled.
Unfortunately,
the
clues
they
were
turning
up
here
seemed
to
shed
no
light
at
all
on
what
was
going
on
or
who
was
involved.
The
black
Audi
outside
had
been
rented
in
a
false
name
with
false
credit
card
numbers,
and
the
prints
in
the
car
matched
nothing
in
the
Interpol
database.
Another
agent
hurried
into
the
living
room,
his
eyes
urgent.
"Where's
Captain
Fache?"
