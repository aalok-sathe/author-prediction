death.
Her
grandfather
had
brought
her
to
Scotland
on
a
short
vacation.
They
had
come
to
see
Rosslyn
Chapel
before
going
back
to
Paris.
It
was
late
evening,
and
the
chapel
was
closed.
But
they
were
still
inside.
"Can
we
go
home,
Grand
pere?"
Sophie
begged,
feeling
tired.
"Soon,
dear,
very
soon."
His
voice
was
melancholy.
"I
have
one
last
thing
I
need
to
do
here.
How
about
if
you
wait
in
the
car?"
"You're
doing
another
big
person
thing?"
He
nodded.
"I'll
be
fast.
I
promise."
"Can
I
do
the
archway
code
again?
That
was
fun."
"I
don't
know.
I
have
to
step
outside.
You
won't
be
frightened
in
here
alone?"
"Of
course
not!"
she
said
with
a
huff.
"It's
not
even
dark
yet!"
He
smiled.
"Very
well
then.
"
He
led
her
over
to
the
elaborate
archway
he
had
shown
her
earlier.
Sophie
immediately
plopped
down
on
the
stone
floor,
lying
on
her
back
and
staring
up
at
the
collage
of
puzzle
pieces
overhead.
"I'm
going
to
break
this
code
before
you
get
back!"
"It's
a
race
then."
He
bent
over,
kissed
her
forehead,
and
walked
to
the
nearby
side
door.
"I'll
be
right
outside.
I'll
leave
the
door
open.
If
you
need
me,
just
call."
He
exited
into
the
soft
evening
light.
Sophie
lay
there
on
the
floor,
gazing
up
at
the
code.
Her
eyes
felt
sleepy.
After
a
few
minutes,
the
symbols
got
fuzzy.
And
then
they
disappeared.
When
Sophie
awoke,
the
floor
felt
cold.
"Grand
pere?"
There
was
no
answer.
Standing
up,
she
brushed
herself
off.
The
side
door
was
still
open.
The
evening
was
getting
darker.
She
walked
outside
and
could
see
her
grandfather
standing
on
the
porch
of
a
nearby
stone
house
directly
behind
the
church.
Her
grandfather
was
talking
quietly
to
a
person
barely
visible
inside
the
screened
door.
"Grand
pere
?
"
she
called.
Her
grandfather
turned
and
waved,
motioning
for
her
to
wait
just
a
moment.
Then,
slowly,
he
said
some
final
words
to
the
person
inside
and
blew
a
kiss
toward
the
screened
door.
He
came
to
her
with
tearful
eyes.
"Why
are
you
crying,
Grand
pere?"
He
picked
her
up
and
held
her
close.
"Oh,
Sophie,
you
and
I
have
said
good
bye
to
a
lot
of
people
this
year.
It's
hard."
Sophie
thought
of
the
accident,
of
saying
good
bye
to
her
mother
and
father,
her
grandmother
and
baby
brother.
"Were
you
saying
goodbye
to
another
person?"
"To
a
dear
friend
whom
I
love
very
much,"
he
replied,
his
voice
heavy
with
emotion.
"And
I
fear
I
will
not
see
her
again
for
a
very
long
time."
Standing
with
the
docent,
Langdon
had
been
scanning
the
chapel
walls
and
feeling
a
rising
wariness
that
a
dead
end
might
be
looming.
Sophie
had
wandered
off
to
look
at
the
code
and
left
Langdon
holding
the
rosewood
box,
which
contained
a
Grail
map
that
now
appeared
to
be
no
help
at
all.
Although
Sauniere's
poem
clearly
indicated
Rosslyn,
