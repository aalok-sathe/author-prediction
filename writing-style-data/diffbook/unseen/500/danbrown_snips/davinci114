how
to
respond.
Langdon
asked,
"Do
the
contents
of
this
account
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Sangreal?"
Vernet
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"I
have
no
idea
what
that
is."
Just
then,
Vernet's
cell
phone
rang,
and
he
snatched
it
off
his
belt.
"Oui?"
He
listened
a
moment,
his
expression
one
of
surprise
and
growing
concern.
"La
police?
Si
rapidement?"
He
cursed,
gave
some
quick
directions
in
French,
and
said
he
would
be
up
to
the
lobby
in
a
minute.
Hanging
up
the
phone,
he
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"The
police
have
responded
far
more
quickly
than
usual.
They
are
arriving
as
we
speak."
Sophie
had
no
intention
of
leaving
empty
handed.
"Tell
them
we
came
and
went
already.
If
they
want
to
search
the
bank,
demand
a
search
warrant.
That
will
take
them
time."
"Listen,"
Vernet
said,
"Jacques
was
a
friend,
and
my
bank
does
not
need
this
kind
of
press,
so
for
those
two
reasons,
I
have
no
intention
of
allowing
this
arrest
to
be
made
on
my
premises.
Give
me
a
minute
and
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
to
help
you
leave
the
bank
undetected.
Beyond
that,
I
cannot
get
involved."
He
stood
up
and
hurried
for
the
door.
"Stay
here.
I'll
make
arrangements
and
be
right
back."
"But
the
safe
deposit
box,"
Sophie
declared.
"We
can't
just
leave."
"There's
nothing
I
can
do,"
Vernet
said,
hurrying
out
the
door.
"I'm
sorry."
Sophie
stared
after
him
a
moment,
wondering
if
maybe
the
account
number
was
buried
in
one
of
the
countless
letters
and
packages
her
grandfather
had
sent
her
over
the
years
and
which
she
had
left
unopened.
Langdon
stood
suddenly,
and
Sophie
sensed
an
unexpected
glimmer
of
contentment
in
his
eyes.
"Robert?
You're
smiling."
"Your
grandfather
was
a
genius."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Ten
digits?"
Sophie
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about.
"The
account
number,"
he
said,
a
familiar
lopsided
grin
now
craning
his
face.
"I'm
pretty
sure
he
left
it
for
us
after
all.
"Where?"
Langdon
produced
the
printout
of
the
crime
scene
photo
and
spread
it
out
on
the
coffee
table.
Sophie
needed
only
to
read
the
first
line
to
know
Langdon
was
correct.

"Ten

Sophie
said,
her
cryptologic
senses
tingling
as
she
studied
the
printout.

Grand
pere
wrote
his
account
number
on
the
Louvre
floor!
When
Sophie
had
first
seen
the
scrambled
Fibonacci
sequence
on
the
parquet,
she
had
assumed
its
sole
purpose
was
to
encourage
DCPJ
to
call
in
their
cryptographers
and
get
Sophie
involved.
Later,
she
realized
the
numbers
were
also
a
clue
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
other
lines
a
sequence
out
of
order
a
numeric
anagram.
Now,
utterly
amazed,
she
saw
the
numbers
had
a
more
important
meaning
still.
They
were
almost
certainly
the
final
key
to
opening
her
grandfather's
mysterious
safe
deposit
box.
"He
