continued.
"Christ
as
Messiah
was
critical
to
the
functioning
of
Church
and
state.
Many
scholars
claim
that
the
early
Church
literally
stole
Jesus
from
His
original
followers,
hijacking
His
human
message,
shrouding
it
in
an
impenetrable
cloak
of
divinity,
and
using
it
to
expand
their
own
power.
I've
written
several
books
on
the
topic."
"And
I
assume
devout
Christians
send
you
hate
mail
on
a
daily
basis?"
"Why
would
they?"
Teabing
countered.
"The
vast
majority
of
educated
Christians
know
the
history
of
their
faith.
Jesus
was
indeed
a
great
and
powerful
man.
Constantine's
underhanded
political
maneuvers
don't
diminish
the
majesty
of
Christ's
life.
Nobody
is
saying
Christ
was
a
fraud,
or
denying
that
He
walked
the
earth
and
inspired
millions
to
better
lives.
All
we
are
saying
is
that
Constantine
took
advantage
of
Christ's
substantial
influence
and
importance.
And
in
doing
so,
he
shaped
the
face
of
Christianity
as
we
know
it
today."
Sophie
glanced
at
the
art
book
before
her,
eager
to
move
on
and
see
the
Da
Vinci
painting
of
the
Holy
Grail.
"The
twist
is
this,"
Teabing
said,
talking
faster
now.
"Because
Constantine
upgraded
Jesus'
status
almost
four
centuries
after
Jesus'
death,
thousands
of
documents
already
existed
chronicling
His
life
as
a
mortal
man.
To
rewrite
the
history
books,
Constantine
knew
he
would
need
a
bold
stroke.
From
this
sprang
the
most
profound
moment
in
Christian
history."
Teabing
paused,
eyeing
Sophie.
"Constantine
commissioned
and
financed
a
new
Bible,
which
omitted
those
gospels
that
spoke
of
Christ's
human
traits
and
embellished
those
gospels
that
made
Him
godlike.
The
earlier
gospels
were
outlawed,
gathered
up,
and
burned."
"An
interesting
note,"
Langdon
added.
"Anyone
who
chose
the
forbidden
gospels
over
Constantine's
version
was
deemed
a
heretic.
The
word
heretic
derives
from
that
moment
in
history.
The
Latin
word
haereticus
means
'choice.'
Those
who
'chose'
the
original
history
of
Christ
were
the
world's
first
heretics.
"Fortunately
for
historians,"
Teabing
said,
"some
of
the
gospels
that
Constantine
attempted
to
eradicate
managed
to
survive.
The
Dead
Sea
Scrolls
were
found
in
the
1950s
hidden
in
a
cave
near
Qumran
in
the
Judean
desert.
And,
of
course,
the
Coptic
Scrolls
in
1945
at
Nag
Hammadi.
In
addition
to
telling
the
true
Grail
story,
these
documents
speak
of
Christ's
ministry
in
very
human
terms.
Of
course,
the
Vatican,
in
keeping
with
their
tradition
of
misinformation,
tried
very
hard
to
suppress
the
release
of
these
scrolls.
And
why
wouldn't
they?
The
scrolls
highlight
glaring
historical
discrepancies
and
fabrications,
clearly
confirming
that
the
modern
Bible
was
compiled
and
edited
by
men
who
possessed
a
political
agenda
to
promote
the
divinity
of
the
man
Jesus
Christ
and
use
His
influence
to
solidify
their
own
power
base."
"And
yet,"
Langdon
countered,
"it's
important
to
remember
that
the
modern
Church's
desire
to
suppress
these
documents
comes
from
a
sincere
belief
in
their
established
view
of
Christ.
The
Vatican
is
made
up
of
deeply
pious
men
who
truly
believe
these
contrary
documents
could
only
be
false
testimony.
Teabing
chuckled
as
