sfumato
style,
in
which
forms
appear
to
evaporate
into
one
another.
Since
taking
up
residence
in
the
Louvre,
the
Mona
Lisa
or
La
Jaconde
as
they
call
her
in
France
had
been
stolen
twice,
most
recently
in
1911,
when
she
disappeared
from
the
Louvre's
"satte
impenetrable"
Le
Salon
Carre.
Parisians
wept
in
the
streets
and
wrote
newspaper
articles
begging
the
thieves
for
the
painting's
return.
Two
years
later,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
discovered
hidden
in
the
false
bottom
of
a
trunk
in
a
Florence
hotel
room.
Langdon,
now
having
made
it
clear
to
Sophie
that
he
had
no
intention
of
leaving,
moved
with
her
across
the
Salle
des
Etats.
The
Mona
Lisa
was
still
twenty
yards
ahead
when
Sophie
turned
on
the
black
light,
and
the
bluish
crescent
of
penlight
fanned
out
on
the
floor
in
front
of
them.
She
swung
the
beam
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
like
a
minesweeper,
searching
for
any
hint
of
luminescent
ink.
Walking
beside
her,
Langdon
was
already
feeling
the
tingle
of
anticipation
that
accompanied
his
face
to
face
reunions
with
great
works
of
art.
He
strained
to
see
beyond
the
cocoon
of
purplish
light
emanating
from
the
black
light
in
Sophie's
hand.
To
the
left,
the
room's
octagonal
viewing
divan
emerged,
looking
like
a
dark
island
on
the
empty
sea
of
parquet.
Langdon
could
now
begin
to
see
the
panel
of
dark
glass
on
the
wall.
Behind
it,
he
knew,
in
the
confines
of
her
own
private
cell,
hung
the
most
celebrated
painting
in
the
world.
The
Mona
Lisa
's
status
as
the
most
famous
piece
of
art
in
the
world,
Langdon
knew,
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
enigmatic
smile.
Nor
was
it
due
to
the
mysterious
interpretations
attributed
her
by
many
art
historians
and
conspiracy
buffs.
Quite
simply,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
famous
because
Leonardo
da
Vinci
claimed
she
was
his
finest
accomplishment.
He
carried
the
painting
with
him
whenever
he
traveled
and,
if
asked
why,
would
reply
that
he
found
it
hard
to
part
with
his
most
sublime
expression
of
female
beauty.
Even
so,
many
art
historians
suspected
Da
Vinci's
reverence
for
the
Mona
Lisa
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
artistic
mastery.
In
actuality,
the
painting
was
a
surprisingly
ordinary
sfumato
portrait.
Da
Vinci's
veneration
for
this
work,
many
claimed,
stemmed
from
something
far
deeper:
a
hidden
message
in
the
layers
of
paint.
The
Mona
Lisa
was,
in
fact,
one
of
the
world's
most
documented
inside
jokes.
The
painting's
well
documented
collage
of
double
entendres
and
playful
allusions
had
been
revealed
in
most
art
history
tomes,
and
yet,
incredibly,
the
public
at
large
still
considered
her
smile
a
great
mystery.
No
mystery
at
all,
Langdon
thought,
moving
forward
and
watching
as
the
faint
outline
of
the
painting
began
to
take
shape.
No
mystery
at
all.
Most
recently
Langdon
had
shared
the
Mona
Lisa
's
secret
with
a
rather
unlikely
group
a
dozen
inmates
at
the
Essex
County
Penitentiary.
Langdon's
jail
seminar
was
part
of
a
Harvard
outreach
program
