slip
of
paper?"
Sophie
knew
she
had
been
in
a
hurry
inside
the
Louvre,
but
she
was
certain
she
had
seen
nothing
else
behind
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
"No.
Just
the
key."
Vernet
gave
a
helpless
sigh.
"I'm
afraid
every
key
is
electronically
paired
with
a
ten
digit
account
number
that
functions
as
a
password.
Without
that
number,
your
key
is
worthless."
Ten
digits.
Sophie
reluctantly
calculated
the
cryptographic
odds.
Over
ten
billion
possible
choices.
Even
if
she
could
bring
in
DCPJ's
most
powerful
parallel
processing
computers,
she
still
would
need
weeks
to
break
the
code.
"Certainly,
monsieur,
considering
the
circumstances,
you
can
help
us."
"I'm
sorry.
I
truly
can
do
nothing.
Clients
select
their
own
account
numbers
via
a
secure
terminal,
meaning
account
numbers
are
known
only
to
the
client
and
computer.
This
is
one
way
we
ensure
anonymity.
And
the
safety
of
our
employees."
Sophie
understood.
Convenience
stores
did
the
same
thing.
EMPLOYEES
DO
NOT
HAVE
KEYS
TO
THE
SAFE.
This
bank
obviously
did
not
want
to
risk
someone
stealing
a
key
and
then
holding
an
employee
hostage
for
the
account
number.
Sophie
sat
down
beside
Langdon,
glanced
down
at
the
key
and
then
up
at
Vernet.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what
my
grandfather
is
storing
in
your
bank?"
"None
whatsoever.
That
is
the
definition
of
a
Geldschrank
bank."
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
she
pressed,
"our
time
tonight
is
short.
I
am
going
to
be
very
direct
if
I
may."
She
reached
out
to
the
gold
key
and
flipped
it
over,
watching
the
man's
eyes
as
she
revealed
the
Priory
of
Sion
seal.
"Does
the
symbol
on
this
key
mean
anything
to
you?"
Vernet
glanced
down
at
the
fleur
de
lis
seal
and
made
no
reaction.
"No,
but
many
of
our
clients
emboss
corporate
logos
or
initials
onto
their
keys."
Sophie
sighed,
still
watching
him
carefully.
"This
seal
is
the
symbol
of
a
secret
society
known
as
the
Priory
of
Sion."
Vernet
again
showed
no
reaction.
"I
know
nothing
of
this.
Your
grandfather
was
a
friend,
but
we
spoke
mostly
of
business."
The
man
adjusted
his
tie,
looking
nervous
now.
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
Sophie
pressed,
her
tone
firm.
"My
grandfather
called
me
tonight
and
told
me
he
and
I
were
in
grave
danger.
He
said
he
had
to
give
me
something.
He
gave
me
a
key
to
your
bank.
Now
he
is
dead.
Anything
you
can
tell
us
would
be
helpful."
Vernet
broke
a
sweat.
"We
need
to
get
out
of
the
building.
I'm
afraid
the
police
will
arrive
shortly.
My
watchman
felt
obliged
to
call
Interpol."
Sophie
had
feared
as
much.
She
took
one
last
shot.
"My
grandfather
said
he
needed
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
my
family.
Does
that
mean
anything
to
you?"
"Mademoiselle,
your
family
died
in
a
car
accident
when
you
were
young.
I'm
sorry.
I
know
your
grandfather
loved
you
very
much.
He
mentioned
to
me
several
times
how
much
it
pained
him
that
you
two
had
fallen
out
of
touch."
Sophie
was
uncertain
