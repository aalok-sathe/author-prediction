through

thin
layer

the
script
appeared
in

on

Teabing
croaked,
hanging
his
head
in
shame.
"My
native
tongue."
At
the
rear
of
the
plane,
Remy
Legaludec
strained
to
hear
beyond
the
rumbling
engines,
but
the
conversation
up
front
was
inaudible.
Remy
did
not
like
the
way
the
night
was
progressing.
Not
at
all.
He
looked
down
at
the
bound
monk
at
his
feet.
The
man
lay
perfectly
still
now,
as
if
in
a
trance
of
acceptance,
or
perhaps,
in
silent
prayer
for
deliverance.

Robert

felt

fade
away
as
all
of

thoughts
converged
on
Sauniere's

poem,
which

illuminated
through

Sophie
quickly
found
some
paper
and
copied
it
down
longhand.
When
she
was
done,
the
three
of
them
took
turns
reading
the
text.
It
was
like
some
kind
of
archaeological
crossword
a
riddle
that
promised
to
reveal
how
to
open
the
cryptex.
Langdon
read
the
verse
slowly.
An
ancient
word
of
wisdom
frees
this
scroll
and
helps
us

Before
Langdon
could
even
ponder
what
ancient
password
the
verse
was
trying
to
reveal,
he
felt
something
far
more
fundamental
resonate
within
him
the
meter
of
the
poem.
Iambic
pentameter.
Langdon
had
come
across
this
meter
often
over
the
years
while
researching
secret
societies
across
Europe,
including
just
last
year
in
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
For
centuries,
iambic
pentameter
had
been
a
preferred
poetic
meter
of
outspoken
literati
across
the
globe,
from
the
ancient
Greek
writer
Archilochus
to
Shakespeare,
Milton,
Chaucer,
and
Voltaire
bold
souls
who
chose
to
write
their
social
commentaries
in
a
meter
that
many
of
the
day
believed
had
mystical
properties.
The
roots
of
iambic
pentameter
were
deeply
pagan.
Iambs.
Two
syllables
with
opposite
emphasis.
Stressed
and
unstressed.
Yin
yang.
A
balanced
pair.
Arranged
in
strings
of
five.
Pentameter.
Five
for
the
pentacle
of
Venus
and
the
sacred
feminine.
"It's
pentameter!"
Teabing
blurted,
turning
to
Langdon.
"And
the
verse
is
in
English!
La
lingua
pural"
Langdon
nodded.
The
Priory,
like
many
European
secret
societies
at
odds
with
the
Church,
had
considered
English
the
only
European
pure
language
for
centuries.
Unlike
French,
Spanish,
and
Italian,
which
were
rooted
in
Latin
the
tongue
of
the
Vatican
English
was
linguistically
removed
from
Rome's
propaganda
machine,
and
therefore
became
a
sacred,
secret
tongue
for
those
brotherhoods
educated
enough
to
learn
it.
"This
poem,"
Teabing
gushed,
"references
not
only
the
Grail,
but
the
Knights
Templar
and
the
scattered
family
of
Mary
Magdalene!
What
more
could
we
ask
for?"
"The
password,"
Sophie
said,
looking
again
at
the
poem.
"It
sounds
like
we
need
some
kind
of
ancient
word
of
wisdom?"
"Abracadabra?"
Teabing
ventured,
his
eyes
twinkling.
A
word
of
five
letters,
Langdon
thought,
pondering
the
staggering
number
of
