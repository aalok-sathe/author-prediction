found
the
Grand
Gallery
sealed.
Through
the
gate,
they
could
hear
someone
moving
around
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor,
but
they
could
not
see
who
it
was.
They
shouted,
but
they
got
no
answer.
Assuming
it
could
only
be
a
criminal,
they
followed
protocol
and
called
in
the
Judicial
Police.
We
took
up
positions
within
fifteen
minutes.
When
we
arrived,
we
raised
the
barricade
enough
to
slip
underneath,
and
I
sent
a
dozen
armed
agents
inside.
They
swept
the
length
of
the
gallery
to
corner
the
intruder."
"And?"
"They
found
no
one
inside.
Except"
He
pointed
farther
down
the
hall.
"Him."
Langdon
lifted
his
gaze
and
followed
Fache's
outstretched
finger.
At
first
he
thought
Fache
was
pointing
to
a
large
marble
statue
in
the
middle
of
the
hallway.
As
they
continued,
though,
Langdon
began
to
see
past
the
statue.
Thirty
yards
down
the
hall,
a
single
spotlight
on
a
portable
pole
stand
shone
down
on
the
floor,
creating
a
stark
island
of
white
light
in
the
dark
crimson
gallery.
In
the
center
of
the
light,
like
an
insect
under
a
microscope,
the
corpse
of
the
curator
lay
naked
on
the
parquet
floor.
"You
saw
the
photograph,"
Fache
said,
"so
this
should
be
of
no
surprise."
Langdon
felt
a
deep
chill
as
they
approached
the
body.
Before
him
was
one
of
the
strangest
images
he
had
ever
seen.
The
pallid
corpse
of
Jacques
Sauniere
lay
on
the
parquet
floor
exactly
as
it
appeared
in
the
photograph.
As
Langdon
stood
over
the
body
and
squinted
in
the
harsh
light,
he
reminded
himself
to
his
amazement
that
Sauniere
had
spent
his
last
minutes
of
life
arranging
his
own
body
in
this
strange
fashion.
Sauniere
looked
remarkably
fit
for
a
man
of
his
years
and
all
of
his
musculature
was
in
plain
view.
He
had
stripped
off
every
shred
of
clothing,
placed
it
neatly
on
the
floor,
and
laid
down
on
his
back
in
the
center
of
the
wide
corridor,
perfectly
aligned
with
the
long
axis
of
the
room.
His
arms
and
legs
were
sprawled
outward
in
a
wide
spread
eagle,
like
those
of
a
child
making
a
snow
angel
or,
perhaps
more
appropriately,
like
a
man
being
drawn
and
quartered
by
some
invisible
force.
Just
below
Sauniere's
breastbone,
a
bloody
smear
marked
the
spot
where
the
bullet
had
pierced
his
flesh.
The
wound
had
bled
surprisingly
little,
leaving
only
a
small
pool
of
blackened
blood.
Sauniere's
left
index
finger
was
also
bloody,
apparently
having
been
dipped
into
the
wound
to
create
the
most
unsettling
aspect
of
his
own
macabre
deathbed;
using
his
own
blood
as
ink,
and
employing
his
own
naked
abdomen
as
a
canvas,
Sauniere
had
drawn
a
simple
symbol
on
his
flesh
five
straight
lines
that
intersected
to
form
a
five
pointed
star.
The
pentacle.
The
bloody
star,
centered
on
Sauniere's
navel,
gave
his
corpse
a
distinctly
ghoulish
aura.
The
photo
Langdon
had
seen
was
chilling
enough,
but
now,
witnessing
the
scene
in
person,
Langdon
felt
a
deepening
uneasiness.
