Babel.
The
mysterious
city
of
Sheshach
was
revealed
as
the
city
of
Babel,
and
a
frenzy
of
biblical
examination
ensued.
Within
weeks,
several
more
Atbash
code
words
were
uncovered
in
the
Old
Testament,
unveiling
myriad
hidden
meanings
that
scholars
had
no
idea
were
there.
"We're
getting
close,"
Langdon
whispered,
unable
to
control
his
excitement.
"Inches,
Robert,"
Teabing
said.
He
glanced
over
at
Sophie
and
smiled.
"You
ready?"
She
nodded.
"Okay,
Baphomet
in
Hebrew
without
the
vowels
reads:
B
P
V
M
Th.
Now
we
simply
apply
your
Atbash
substitution
matrix
to
translate
the
letters
into
our
five
letter
password."
Langdon's
heart
pounded.
B
P
V
M
Th.
The
sun
was
pouring
through
the
windows
now.
He
looked
at
Sophie's
substitution
matrix
and
slowly
began
to
make
the
conversion.
B
is
Sh
P
is
V
Teabing
was
grinning
like
a
schoolboy
at
Christmas.
"And
the
Atbash
Cipher
reveals"
He
stopped
short.
"Good
God!"
His
face
went
white.
Langdon's
head
snapped
up.
"What's
wrong?"
Sophie
demanded.
"You
won't
believe
this."
Teabing
glanced
at
Sophie.
"Especially
you."
"What
do
you
mean?"
she
said.
"This
is
ingenious,"
he
whispered.
"Utterly
ingenious!"
Teabing
wrote
again
on
the
paper.
"Drumroll,
please.
Here
is
your
password."
He
showed
them
what
he
had
written.
Sh
V
P
Y
A
Sophie
scowled.
"What
is
it?"
Langdon
didn't
recognize
it
either.
Teabing's
voice
seemed
to
tremble
with
awe.
"This,
my
friend,
is
actually
an
ancient
word
of
wisdom."
Langdon
read
the
letters
again.
An
ancient
word
of
wisdom
frees
this
scroll.
An
instant
later
he
got
it.
He
had
newer
seen
this
coming.
"An
ancient
word
of
wisdom!"
Teabing
was
laughing.
"Quite
literally!"
Sophie
looked
at
the
word
and
then
at
the
dial.
Immediately
she
realized
Langdon
and
Teabing
had
failed
to
see
a
serious
glitch.
"Hold
on!
This
can't
be
the
password,"
she
argued.
"The
cryptex
doesn't
have
an
Sh
on
the
dial.
It
uses
a
traditional
Roman
alphabet.
"Read
the
word,"
Langdon
urged.
"Keep
in
mind
two
things.
In
Hebrew,
the
symbol
for
the
sound
Sh
can
also
be
pronounced
as
S,
depending
on
the
accent.
Just
as
the
letter
P
can
be
pronounced
F."
SVFYA?
she
thought,
puzzled.
"Genius!"
Teabing
added.
"The
letter
Vav
is
often
a
placeholder
for
the
vowel
sound
O!"
Sophie
again
looked
at
the
letters,
attempting
to
sound
them
out.
"Sofya."
She
heard
the
sound
of
her
voice,
and
could
not
believe
what
she
had
just
said.
"Sophia?
This
spells
Sophia?"
Langdon
was
nodding
enthusiastically.
"Yes!
Sophia
literally
means
wisdom
in
Greek.
The
root
of
your
name,
Sophie,
is
literally
a
'word
of
wisdom.'
Sophie
suddenly
missed
her
grandfather
immensely.
He
encrypted
the
Priory
keystone
with
my
name.
A
knot
caught
in
her
throat.
It
all
seemed
so
perfect.
But
as
she
turned
her
gaze
to
the
five
lettered
dials
on
the
cryptex,
she
realized
a
problem
still
existed.
"But
wait
the
word
Sophia
has
six
letters."
Teabing's
smile
never
faded.
"Look
at
the
poem
again.
Your
grandfather
wrote,
'An
ancient
word
