master
of
double
entendres,"
Sophie
said,
turning
to
Langdon.
"He
loved
anything
with
multiple
layers
of
meaning.
Codes
within
codes."
Langdon
was
already
moving
toward
the
electronic
podium
near
the
conveyor
belt.
Sophie
grabbed
the
computer
printout
and
followed.
The
podium
had
a
keypad
similar
to
that
of
a
bank
ATM
terminal.
The
screen
displayed
the
bank's
cruciform
logo.
Beside
the
keypad
was
a
triangular
hole.
Sophie
wasted
no
time
inserting
the
shaft
of
her
key
into
the
hole.
The
screen
refreshed
instantly.
ACCOUNT
NUMBER:
The
cursor
blinked.
Waiting.
Ten
digits.
Sophie
read
the
numbers
off
the
printout,
and
Langdon
typed
them
in.
ACCOUNT
NUMBER:
1332211185
When
he
had
typed
the
last
digit,
the
screen
refreshed
again.
A
message
in
several
languages
appeared.
English
was
on
top.
CAUTION:
Before
you
strike
the
enter
key,
please
check
the
accuracy
of
your
account
number.
For
your
own
security,
if
the
computer
does
not
recognize
your
account
number,
this
system
will
automatically
shut
down.
"Fonction
terminer,
"
Sophie
said,
frowning.
"Looks
like
we
only
get
one
try."
Standard
ATM
machines
allowed
users
three
attempts
to
type
a
PIN
before
confiscating
their
bank
card.
This
was
obviously
no
ordinary
cash
machine.
"The
number
looks
right,"
Langdon
confirmed,
carefully
checking
what
they
had
typed
and
comparing
it
to
the
printout.
He
motioned
to
the
ENTER
key.
"Fire
away."
Sophie
extended
her
index
finger
toward
the
keypad,
but
hesitated,
an
odd
thought
now
hitting
her.
"Go
ahead,"
Langdon
urged.
"Vernet
will
be
back
soon."
"No."
She
pulled
her
hand
away.
"This
isn't
the
right
account
number."
"Of
course
it
is!
Ten
digits.
What
else
would
it
be?"
"It's
too
random."
Too
random?
Langdon
could
not
have
disagreed
more.
Every
bank
advised
its
customers
to
choose
PINs
at
random
so
nobody
could
guess
them.
Certainly
clients
here
would
be
advised
to
choose
their
account
numbers
at
random.
Sophie
deleted
everything
she
had
just
typed
in
and
looked
up
at
Langdon,
her
gaze
self
assured.
"It's
far
too
coincidental
that
this
supposedly
random
account
number
could
be
rearranged
to
form
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
Langdon
realized
she
had
a
point.
Earlier,
Sophie
had
rearranged
this
account
number
into
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
What
were
the
odds
of
being
able
to
do
that?
Sophie
was
at
the
keypad
again,
entering
a
different
number,
as
if
from
memory.
"Moreover,
with
my
grandfather's
love
of
symbolism
and
codes,
it
seems
to
follow
that
he
would
have
chosen
an
account
number
that
had
meaning
to
him,
something
he
could
easily
remember."
She
finished
typing
the
entry
and
gave
a
sly
smile.
"Something
that
appeared
random
but
was
not.
"
Langdon
looked
at
the
screen.
ACCOUNT
NUMBER:
1123581321
It
took
him
an
instant,
but
when
Langdon
spotted
it,
he
knew
she
was
right.
The
Fibonacci
sequence.

When
the
Fibonacci
sequence
was
melded
into
a
single
ten
digit
number,
it
became
virtually
unrecognizable.
Easy
to
remember,
and
yet
seemingly
random.
A
brilliant
ten
digit
code
that
Sauniere
would
