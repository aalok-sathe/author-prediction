her
or
try
to
meet
her
in
public.
She
was
afraid
his
explanation
would
be
more
terrifying
than
the
incident
itself.
Incredibly,
Sauniere
had
never
given
up
on
her,
and
Sophie
now
possessed
a
decade's
worth
of
correspondence
unopened
in
a
dresser
drawer.
To
her
grandfather's
credit,
he
had
never
once
disobeyed
her
request
and
phoned
her.
Until
this
afternoon.
"Sophie?"
His
voice
had
sounded
startlingly
old
on
her
answering
machine.
"I
have
abided
by
your
wishes
for
so
long
and
it
pains
me
to
call,
but
I
must
speak
to
you.
Something
terrible
has
happened."
Standing
in
the
kitchen
of
her
Paris
flat,
Sophie
felt
a
chill
to
hear
him
again
after
all
these
years.
His
gentle
voice
brought
back
a
flood
of
fond
childhood
memories.
"Sophie,
please
listen."
He
was
speaking
English
to
her,
as
he
always
did
when
she
was
a
little
girl.
Practice
French
at
school.
Practice
English
at
home.
"You
cannot
be
mad
forever.
Have
you
not
read
the
letters
that
I've
sent
all
these
years?
Do
you
not
yet
understand?"
He
paused.
"We
must
speak
at
once.
Please
grant
your
grandfather
this
one
wish.
Call
me
at
the
Louvre.
Right
away.
I
believe
you
and
I
are
in
grave
danger."
Sophie
stared
at
the
answering
machine.
Danger?
What
was
he
talking
about?
"Princess"
Her
grandfather's
voice
cracked
with
an
emotion
Sophie
could
not
place.
"I
know
I've
kept
things
from
you,
and
I
know
it
has
cost
me
your
love.
But
it
was
for
your
own
safety.
Now
you
must
know
the
truth.
Please,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family."
Sophie
suddenly
could
hear
her
own
heart.
My
family?
Sophie's
parents
had
died
when
she
was
only
four.
Their
car
went
off
a
bridge
into
fast
moving
water.
Her
grandmother
and
younger
brother
had
also
been
in
the
car,
and
Sophie's
entire
family
had
been
erased
in
an
instant.
She
had
a
box
of
newspaper
clippings
to
confirm
it.
His
words
had
sent
an
unexpected
surge
of
longing
through
her
bones.
My
family!
In
that
fleeting
instant,
Sophie
saw
images
from
the
dream
that
had
awoken
her
countless
times
when
she
was
a
little
girl:
My
family
is
alive!
They
are
coming
home!
But,
as
in
her
dream,
the
pictures
evaporated
into
oblivion.
Your
family
is
dead,
Sophie.
They
are
not
coming
home.
"Sophie"
her
grandfather
said
on
the
machine.
"I
have
been
waiting
for
years
to
tell
you.
Waiting
for
the
right
moment,
but
now
time
has
run
out.
Call
me
at
the
Louvre.
As
soon
as
you
get
this.
I'll
wait
here
all
night.
I
fear
we
both
may
be
in
danger.
There's
so
much
you
need
to
know."
The
message
ended.
In
the
silence,
Sophie
stood
trembling
for
what
felt
like
minutes.
As
she
considered
her
grandfather's
message,
only
one
possibility
made
sense,
and
his
true
intent
dawned.
It
was
bait.
Obviously,
her
grandfather
wanted
desperately
to
see
her.
He
was
trying
anything.
Her
disgust
for
the
man
