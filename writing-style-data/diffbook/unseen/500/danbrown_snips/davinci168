at
this."
He
handed
Collet
a
pair
of
night
vision
binoculars.
"The
grove
of
trees
near
the
top
of
the
driveway."
Collet
aimed
the
binoculars
up
the
hill
and
adjusted
the
image
intensifier
dials.
Slowly,
the
greenish
shapes
came
into
focus.
He
located
the
curve
of
the
driveway
and
slowly
followed
it
up,
reaching
the
grove
of
trees.
All
he
could
do
was
stare.
There,
shrouded
in
the
greenery,
was
an
armored
truck.
A
truck
identical
to
the
one
Collet
had
permitted
to
leave
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
earlier
tonight.
He
prayed
this
was
some
kind
of
bizarre
coincidence,
but
he
knew
it
could
not
be.
"It
seems
obvious,"
the
agent
said,
"that
this
truck
is
how
Langdon
and
Neveu
got
away
from
the
bank."
Collet
was
speechless.
He
thought
of
the
armored
truck
driver
he
had
stopped
at
the
roadblock.
The
Rolex.
His
impatience
to
leave.
never
checked
the
cargo
hold.
Incredulous,
Collet
realized
that
someone
in
the
bank
had
actually
lied
to
DCPJ
about
Langdon
and
Sophie's
whereabouts
and
then
helped
them
escape.
But
who?
And
why?
Collet
wondered
if
maybe
this
were
the
reason
Fache
had
told
him
not
to
take
action
yet.
Maybe
Fache
realized
there
were
more
people
involved
tonight
than
just
Langdon
and
Sophie.
And
if
Langdon
and
Neveu
arrived
in
the
armored
truck,
then
who
drove
the
Audi?
Hundreds
of
miles
to
the
south,
a
chartered
Beechcraft
Baron
58
raced
northward
over
the
Tyrrhenian
Sea.
Despite
calm
skies,
Bishop
Aringarosa
clutched
an
airsickness
bag,
certain
he
could
be
ill
at
any
moment.
His
conversation
with
Paris
had
not
at
all
been
what
he
had
imagined.
Alone
in
the
small
cabin,
Aringarosa
twisted
the
gold
ring
on
his
finger
and
tried
to
ease
his
overwhelming
sense
of
fear
and
desperation.
Everything
in
Paris
has
gone
terribly
wrong.
Closing
his
eyes,
Aringarosa
said
a
prayer
that
Bezu
Fache
would
have
the
means
to
fix
it.
Teabing
sat
on
the
divan,
cradling
the
wooden
box
on
his
lap
and
admiring
the
lid's
intricate
inlaid
Rose.
Tonight
has
become
the
strangest
and
most
magical
night
of
my
life.
"Lift
the
lid,"
Sophie
whispered,
standing
over
him,
beside
Langdon.
Teabing
smiled.
Do
not
rush
me.
Having
spent
over
a
decade
searching
for
this
keystone,
he
wanted
to
savor
every
millisecond
of
this
moment.
He
ran
a
palm
across
the
wooden
lid,
feeling
the
texture
of
the
inlaid
flower.
"The
Rose,"
he
whispered.
The
Rose
is
Magdalene
is
the
Holy
Grail.
The
Rose
is
the
compass
that
guides
the
way.
Teabing
felt
foolish.
For
years
he
had
traveled
to
cathedrals
and
churches
all
over
France,
paying
for
special
access,
examining
hundreds
of
archways
beneath
rose
windows,
searching
for
an
encrypted
keystone.
La
clef
de
voute
a
stone
key
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
Teabing
slowly
unlatched
the
lid
and
raised
it.
As
his
eyes
finally
gazed
upon
the
contents,
he
knew
in
an
instant
it
could
only
be
the
keystone.
He
was
staring
at
a
stone
cylinder,
