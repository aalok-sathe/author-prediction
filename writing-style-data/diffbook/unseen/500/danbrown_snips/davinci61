declared,
her
voice
hollow
in
the
stairwell.
"To
the
Mona
Lisa?"
Langdon
recoiled.
"Now?"
Sophie
considered
the
risk.
"I'm
not
a
murder
suspect.
I'll
take
my
chances.
I
need
to
understand
what
my
grandfather
was
trying
to
tell
me."
"What
about
the
embassy?"
Sophie
felt
guilty
turning
Langdon
into
a
fugitive
only
to
abandon
him,
but
she
saw
no
other
option.
She
pointed
down
the
stairs
to
a
metal
door.
"Go
through
that
door,
and
follow
the
illuminated
exit
signs.
My
grandfather
used
to
bring
me
down
here.
The
signs
will
lead
you
to
a
security
turnstile.
It's
monodirectional
and
opens
out."
She
handed
Langdon
her
car
keys.
"Mine
is
the
red
SmartCar
in
the
employee
lot.
Directly
outside
this
bulkhead.
Do
you
know
how
to
get
to
the
embassy?"
Langdon
nodded,
eyeing
the
keys
in
his
hand.
"Listen,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
softening.
"I
think
my
grandfather
may
have
left
me
a
message
at
the
Mona
Lisa
some
kind
of
clue
as
to
who
killed
him.
Or
why
I'm
in
danger."
Or
what
happened
to
my
family.
"I
have
to
go
see."
"But
if
he
wanted
to
tell
you
why
you
were
in
danger,
why
wouldn't
he
simply
write
it
on
the
floor
where
he
died?
Why
this
complicated
word
game?"
"Whatever
my
grandfather
was
trying
to
tell
me,
I
don't
think
he
wanted
anyone
else
to
hear
it.
Not
even
the
police."
Clearly,
her
grandfather
had
done
everything
in
his
power
to
send
a
confidential
transmission
directly
to
her.
He
had
written
it
in
code,
included
her
secret
initials,
and
told
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon
a
wise
command,
considering
the
American
symbologist
had
deciphered
his
code.
"As
strange
as
it
may
sound,"
Sophie
said,
"I
think
he
wants
me
to
get
to
the
Mona
Lisa
before
anyone
else
does."
"I'llcome."
"No!
We
don't
know
how
long
the
Grand
Gallery
will
stay
empty.
You
have
to
go."
Langdon
seemed
hesitant,
as
if
his
own
academic
curiosity
were
threatening
to
override
sound
judgment
and
drag
him
back
into
Fache's
hands.
"Go.
Now."
Sophie
gave
him
a
grateful
smile.
"I'll
see
you
at
the
embassy,
Mr.
Langdon."
Langdon
looked
displeased.
"I'll
meet
you
there
on
one
condition,"
he
replied,
his
voice
stern.
She
paused,
startled.
"What's
that?"
"That
you
stop
calling
me
Mr.
Langdon."
Sophie
detected
the
faint
hint
of
a
lopsided
grin
growing
across
Langdon's
face,
and
she
felt
herself
smile
back.
"Good
luck,
Robert."
When
Langdon
reached
the
landing
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
the
unmistakable
smell
of
linseed
oil
and
plaster
dust
assaulted
his
nostrils.
Ahead,
an
illuminated
SORTIEEXIT
displayed
an
arrow
pointing
down
a
long
corridor.
Langdon
stepped
into
the
hallway.
To
the
right
gaped
a
murky
restoration
studio
out
of
which
peered
an
army
of
statues
in
various
states
of
repair.
To
the
left,
Langdon
saw
a
suite
of
studios
that
resembled
Harvard
art
classrooms
rows
of
easels,
paintings,
palettes,
framing
tools
an
art
assembly
line.
As
he
moved
down
the
hallway,
Langdon
wondered
