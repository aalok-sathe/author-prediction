of
his
own
volition.
Still,
it
had
been
almost
ten
minutes.
Too
long.
"Any
chance
Langdon
is
onto
us?"
Fache
asked.
Collet
shook
his
head.
"We're
still
seeing
small
movements
inside
the
men's
room,
so
the
GPS
dot
is
obviously
still
on
him.
Perhaps
he
feels
ill?
If
he
had
found
the
dot,
he
would
have
removed
it
and
tried
to
run.
Fache
checked
his
watch.
"Fine."
Still
Fache
seemed
preoccupied.
All
evening,
Collet
had
sensed
an
atypical
intensity
in
his
captain.
Usually
detached
and
cool
under
pressure,
Fache
tonight
seemed
emotionally
engaged,
as
if
this
were
somehow
a
personal
matter
for
him.
Not
surprising,
Collet
thought.
Fache
needs
this
arrest
desperately.
Recently
the
Board
of
Ministers
and
the
media
had
become
more
openly
critical
of
Fache's
aggressive
tactics,
his
clashes
with
powerful
foreign
embassies,
and
his
gross
overbudgeting
on
new
technologies.
Tonight,
a
high
tech,
high
profile
arrest
of
an
American
would
go
a
long
way
to
silence
Fache's
critics,
helping
him
secure
the
job
a
few
more
years
until
he
could
retire
with
the
lucrative
pension.
God
knows
he
needs
the
pension,
Collet
thought.
Fache's
zeal
for
technology
had
hurt
him
both
professionally
and
personally.
Fache
was
rumored
to
have
invested
his
entire
savings
in
the
technology
craze
a
few
years
back
and
lost
his
shirt.
And
Fache
is
a
man
who
wears
only
the
finest
shirts.
Tonight,
there
was
still
plenty
of
time.
Sophie
Neveu's
odd
interruption,
though
unfortunate,
had
been
only
a
minor
wrinkle.
She
was
gone
now,
and
Fache
still
had
cards
to
play.
He
had
yet
to
inform
Langdon
that
his
name
had
been
scrawled
on
the
floor
by
the
victim.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
The
American's
reaction
to
that
little
bit
of
evidence
would
be
telling
indeed.
"Captain?"
one
of
the
DCPJ
agents
now
called
from
across
the
office.
"I
think
you
better
take
this
call."
He
was
holding
out
a
telephone
receiver,
looking
concerned.
"Who
is
it?"
Fache
said.
The
agent
frowned.
"It's
the
director
of
our
Cryptology
Department."
"And?"
"It's
about
Sophie
Neveu,
sir.
Something
is
not
quite
right."
It
was
time.
Silas
felt
strong
as
he
stepped
from
the
black
Audi,
the
nighttime
breeze
rustling
his
loose
fitting
robe.
The
winds
of
change
are
in
the
air.
He
knew
the
task
before
him
would
require
more
finesse
than
force,
and
he
left
his
handgun
in
the
car.
The
thirteen
round
Heckler
Koch
USP
40
had
been
provided
by
the
Teacher.
A
weapon
of
death
has
no
place
in
a
house
of
God.
The
plaza
before
the
great
church
was
deserted
at
this
hour,
the
only
visible
souls
on
the
far
side
of
Place
Saint
Sulpice
a
couple
of
teenage
hookers
showing
their
wares
to
the
late
night
tourist
traffic.
Their
nubile
bodies
sent
a
familiar
longing
to
Silas's
loins.
His
thigh
flexed
instinctively,
causing
the
barbed
cilice
belt
to
cut
painfully
into
his
flesh.
The
lust
evaporated
instantly.
For
ten
years
now,
Silas
had
faithfully
denied
himself
all
sexual
indulgence,
