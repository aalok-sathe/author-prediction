crafted
of
interconnecting
lettered
dials.
The
device
seemed
surprisingly
familiar
to
him.
"Designed
from
Da
Vinci's
diaries,"
Sophie
said.
"My
grandfather
made
them
as
a
hobby."
Of
course,
Teabing
realized.
He
had
seen
the
sketches
and
blueprints.
The
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail
lies
inside
this
stone.
Teabing
lifted
the
heavy
cryptex
from
the
box,
holding
it
gently.
Although
he
had
no
idea
how
to
open
the
cylinder,
he
sensed
his
own
destiny
lay
inside.
In
moments
of
failure,
Teabing
had
questioned
whether
his
life's
quest
would
ever
be
rewarded.
Now
those
doubts
were
gone
forever.
He
could
hear
the
ancient
words
the
foundation
of
the
Grail
legend:
Vous
ne
trouvezpas
le
Saint
Graal,
c'est
le
Saint
Graal
qui
vous
trouve.
You
do
not
find
the
Grail,
the
Grail
finds
you.
And
tonight,
incredibly,
the
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail
had
walked
right
through
his
front
door.
While
Sophie
and
Teabing
sat
with
the
cryptex
and
talked
about
the
vinegar,
the
dials,
and
what
the
password
might
be,
Langdon
carried
the
rosewood
box
across
the
room
to
a
well
lit
table
to
get
a
better
look
at
it.
Something
Teabing
had
just
said
was
now
running
through
Langdon's
mind.
The
key
to
the
Grail
is
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
Langdon
held
the
wooden
box
up
to
the
light
and
examined
the
inlaid
symbol
of
the
Rose.
Although
his
familiarity
with
art
did
not
include
woodworking
or
inlaid
furniture,
he
had
just
recalled
the
famous
tiled
ceiling
of
the
Spanish
monastery
outside
of
Madrid,
where,
three
centuries
after
its
construction,
the
ceiling
tiles
began
to
fall
out,
revealing
sacred
texts
scrawled
by
monks
on
the
plaster
beneath.
Langdon
looked
again
at
the
Rose.
Beneath
the
Rose.
Sub
Rosa.
Secret.
A
bump
in
the
hallway
behind
him
made
Langdon
turn.
He
saw
nothing
but
shadows.
Teabing's
manservant
most
likely
had
passed
through.
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
box.
He
ran
his
finger
over
the
smooth
edge
of
the
inlay,
wondering
if
he
could
pry
the
Rose
out,
but
the
craftsmanship
was
perfect.
He
doubted
even
a
razor
blade
could
fit
in
between
the
inlaid
Rose
and
the
carefully
carved
depression
into
which
it
was
seated.
Opening
the
box,
he
examined
the
inside
of
the
lid.
It
was
smooth.
As
he
shifted
its
position,
though,
the
light
caught
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
hole
on
the
underside
of
the
lid,
positioned
in
the
exact
center.
Langdon
closed
the
lid
and
examined
the
inlaid
symbol
from
the
top.
No
hole.
It
doesn
't
pass
through.
Setting
the
box
on
the
table,
he
looked
around
the
room
and
spied
a
stack
of
papers
with
a
paper
clip
on
it.
Borrowing
the
clip,
he
returned
to
the
box,
opened
it,
and
studied
the
hole
again.
Carefully,
he
unbent
the
paper
clip
and
inserted
one
end
into
the
hole.
He
gave
a
gentle
push.
It
took
almost
no
effort.
He
heard
something
clatter
quietly
onto
the
table.
Langdon
closed
the
lid
