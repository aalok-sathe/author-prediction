eased
himself
into
a
chair
opposite
Sophie.
"As
you
can
see,
our
professor
has
a
far
softer
heart
for
Rome
than
I
do.
Nonetheless,
he
is
correct
about
the
modern
clergy
believing
these
opposing
documents
are
false
testimony.
That's
understandable.
Constantine's
Bible
has
been
their
truth
for
ages.
Nobody
is
more
indoctrinated
than
the
indoctrinator.
"What
he
means,"
Langdon
said,
"is
that
we
worship
the
gods
of
our
fathers."
"What
I
mean,"
Teabing
countered,
"is
that
almost
everything
our
fathers
taught
us
about
Christ
is
false.
As
are
the
stories
about
the
Holy
Grail."
Sophie
looked
again
at
the
Da
Vinci
quote
before
her.
Blinding
ignorance
does
mislead
us.
01
Wretched
mortals,
open
your
eyes!
Teabing
reached
for
the
book
and
flipped
toward
the
center.
"And
finally,
before
I
show
you
Da
Vinci's
paintings
of
the
Holy
Grail,
I'd
like
you
to
take
a
quick
look
at
this."
He
opened
the
book
to
a
colorful
graphic
that
spanned
both
full
pages.
"I
assume
you
recognize
this
fresco?"
He's
kidding,
right?
Sophie
was
staring
at
the
most
famous
fresco
of
all
time
The
Last
Supper
Da
Vinci's
legendary
painting
from
the
wall
of
Santa
Maria
delle
Grazie
near
Milan.
The
decaying
fresco
portrayed
Jesus
and
His
disciples
at
the
moment
that
Jesus
announced
one
of
them
would
betray
Him.
"I
know
the
fresco,
yes."
"Then
perhaps
you
would
indulge
me
this
little
game?
Close
your
eyes
if
you
would."
Uncertain,
Sophie
closed
her
eyes.
"Where
is
Jesus
sitting?"
Teabing
asked.
"In
the
center."
"Good.
And
what
food
are
He
and
His
disciples
breaking
and
eating?"
"Bread."
Obviously.
"Superb.
And
what
drink?"
"Wine.
They
drank
wine."
"Great.
And
one
final
question.
How
many
wineglasses
are
on
the
table?"
Sophie
paused,
realizing
it
was
the
trick
question.
And
after
dinner,
Jesus
took
the
cup
of
wine,
sharing
it
with
His
disciples.
"One
cup,"
she
said.
"The
chalice."
The
Cup
of
Christ.
The
Holy
Grail.
"Jesus
passed
a
single
chalice
of
wine,
just
as
modern
Christians
do
at
communion."
Teabing
sighed.
"Open
your
eyes."
She
did.
Teabing
was
grinning
smugly.
Sophie
looked
down
at
the
painting,
seeing
to
her
astonishment
that
everyone
at
the
table
had
a
glass
of
wine,
including
Christ.
Thirteen
cups.
Moreover,
the
cups
were
tiny,
stemless,
and
made
of
glass.
There
was
no
chalice
in
the
painting.
No
Holy
Grail.
Teabing's
eyes
twinkled.
"A
bit
strange,
don't
you
think,
considering
that
both
the
Bible
and
our
standard
Grail
legend
celebrate
this
moment
as
the
definitive
arrival
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Oddly,
Da
Vinci
appears
to
have
forgotten
to
paint
the
Cup
of
Christ.
"Surely
art
scholars
must
have
noted
that."
"You
will
be
shocked
to
learn
what
anomalies
Da
Vinci
included
here
that
most
scholars
either
do
not
see
or
simply
choose
to
ignore.
This
fresco,
in
fact,
is
the
entire
key
to
the
Holy
Grail
mystery.
Da
Vinci
lays
it
all
out
in
the
open
in
The
Last
Supper"
Sophie
scanned
the
work
eagerly.
"Does
this
fresco
tell
us
