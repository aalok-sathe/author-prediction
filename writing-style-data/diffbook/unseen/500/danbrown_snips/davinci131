his
phone
might
not
have
been
working
properly,
he
feared
what
the
Teacher
might
think
if
he
had
been
repeatedly
phoning
with
no
answer.
He
'11
think
something
is
wrong.
Or
that
I
failed
to
get
the
bonds.
The
bishop
broke
a
light
sweat.
Or
worse
that
I
took
the
money
and
ran!
Even
at
a
modest
sixty
kilometers
an
hour,
the
dangling
front
bumper
of
the
armored
truck
grated
against
the
deserted
suburban
road
with
a
grinding
roar,
spraying
sparks
up
onto
the
hood.
We've
got
to
get
off
the
road,
Langdon
thought.
He
could
barely
even
see
where
they
were
headed.
The
truck's
lone
working
headlight
had
been
knocked
off
center
and
was
casting
a
skewed
sidelong
beam
into
the
woods
beside
the
country
highway.
Apparently
the
armor
in
this
"armored
truck"
referred
only
to
the
cargo
hold
and
not
the
front
end.
Sophie
sat
in
the
passenger
seat,
staring
blankly
at
the
rosewood
box
on
her
lap.
"Are
you
okay?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
looked
shaken.
"Do
you
believe
him?"
"About
the
three
additional
murders?
Absolutely.
It
answers
a
lot
of
questions
the
issue
of
your
grandfather's
desperation
to
pass
on
the
keystone,
as
well
as
the
intensity
with
which
Fache
is
hunting
me."
"No,
I
meant
about
Vernet
trying
to
protect
his
bank."
Langdon
glanced
over.
"As
opposed
to?"
"Taking
the
keystone
for
himself."
Langdon
had
not
even
considered
it.
"How
would
he
even
know
what
this
box
contains?"
"His
bank
stored
it.
He
knew
my
grandfather.
Maybe
he
knew
things.
He
might
have
decided
he
wanted
the
Grail
for
himself."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
Vernet
hardly
seemed
the
type.
"In
my
experience,
there
are
only
two
reasons
people
seek
the
Grail.
Either
they
are
naive
and
believe
they
are
searching
for
the
long
lost
Cup
of
Christ"
"Or?"
"Or
they
know
the
truth
and
are
threatened
by
it.
Many
groups
throughout
history
have
sought
to
destroy
the
Grail."
The
silence
between
them
accentuated
the
sound
of
the
scraping
bumper.
They
had
driven
a
few
kilometers
now,
and
as
Langdon
watched
the
cascade
of
sparks
coming
off
the
front
of
the
truck,
he
wondered
if
it
was
dangerous.
Either
way,
if
they
passed
another
car,
it
would
certainly
draw
attention.
Langdon
made
up
his
mind.
"I'm
going
to
see
if
I
can
bend
this
bumper
back."
Pulling
onto
the
shoulder,
he
brought
the
truck
to
a
stop.
Silence
at
last.
As
Langdon
walked
toward
the
front
of
the
truck,
he
felt
surprisingly
alert.
Staring
into
the
barrel
of
yet
another
gun
tonight
had
given
him
a
second
wind.
He
took
a
deep
breath
of
nighttime
air
and
tried
to
get
his
wits
about
him.
Accompanying
the
gravity
of
being
a
hunted
man,
Langdon
was
starting
to
feel
the
ponderous
weight
of
responsibility,
the
prospect
that
he
and
Sophie
might
actually
be
holding
an
encrypted
set
of
directions
to
one
of
the
most
enduring
mysteries
of
all
time.
As
if
this
burden
were
not
great
enough,
Langdon
now
