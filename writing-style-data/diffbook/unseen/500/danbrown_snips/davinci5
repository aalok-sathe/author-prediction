yet
what
the
Teacher
was
now
commanding
seemed
impossible.
"But
the
church,
it
is
a
fortress.
Especially
at
night.
How
will
I
enter?"
With
the
confident
tone
of
a
man
of
enormous
influence,
the
Teacher
explained
what
was
to
be
done.
When
Silas
hung
up
the
phone,
his
skin
tingled
with
anticipation.
One
hour,
he
told
himself,
grateful
that
the
Teacher
had
given
him
time
to
carry
out
the
necessary
penance
before
entering
a
house
of
God.
must
purge
my
soul
of
today's
sins.
The
sins
committed
today
had
been
holy
in
purpose.
Acts
of
war
against
the
enemies
of
God
had
been
committed
for
centuries.
Forgiveness
was
assured.
Even
so,
Silas
knew,
absolution
required
sacrifice.
Pulling
his
shades,
he
stripped
naked
and
knelt
in
the
center
of
his
room.
Looking
down,
he
examined
the
spiked
cilice
belt
clamped
around
his
thigh.
All
true
followers
of
The
Way
wore
this
device
a
leather
strap,
studded
with
sharp
metal
barbs
that
cut
into
the
flesh
as
a
perpetual
reminder
of
Christ's
suffering.
The
pain
caused
by
the
device
also
helped
counteract
the
desires
of
the
flesh.
Although
Silas
already
had
worn
his
cilice
today
longer
than
the
requisite
two
hours,
he
knew
today
was
no
ordinary
day.
Grasping
the
buckle,
he
cinched
it
one
notch
tighter,
wincing
as
the
barbs
dug
deeper
into
his
flesh.
Exhaling
slowly,
he
savored
the
cleansing
ritual
of
his
pain.
Pain
is
good,
Silas
whispered,
repeating
the
sacred
mantra
of
Father
Josemaria
Escriva
the
Teacher
of
all
Teachers.
Although
Escriva
had
died
in
1975,
his
wisdom
lived
on,
his
words
still
whispered
by
thousands
of
faithful
servants
around
the
globe
as
they
knelt
on
the
floor
and
performed
the
sacred
practice
known
as
"corporal
mortification."
Silas
turned
his
attention
now
to
a
heavy
knotted
rope
coiled
neatly
on
the
floor
beside
him.
The
Discipline.
The
knots
were
caked
with
dried
blood.
Eager
for
the
purifying
effects
of
his
own
agony,
Silas
said
a
quick
prayer.
Then,
gripping
one
end
of
the
rope,
he
closed
his
eyes
and
swung
it
hard
over
his
shoulder,
feeling
the
knots
slap
against
his
back.
He
whipped
it
over
his
shoulder
again,
slashing
at
his
flesh.
Again
and
again,
he
lashed.
Castigo
corpus
meum.
Finally,
he
felt
the
blood
begin
to
flow.
The
crisp
April
air
whipped
through
the
open
window
of
the
Citroen
ZX
as
it
skimmed
south
past
the
Opera
House
and
crossed
Place
Vendome.
In
the
passenger
seat,
Robert
Langdon
felt
the
city
tear
past
him
as
he
tried
to
clear
his
thoughts.
His
quick
shower
and
shave
had
left
him
looking
reasonably
presentable
but
had
done
little
to
ease
his
anxiety.
The
frightening
image
of
the
curator's
body
remained
locked
in
his
mind.
Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead.
Langdon
could
not
help
but
feel
a
deep
sense
of
loss
at
the
curator's
death.
Despite
Sauniere's
reputation
for
being
reclusive,
his
recognition
for
dedication
to
the
arts
made
him
an
easy
man
to
revere.
