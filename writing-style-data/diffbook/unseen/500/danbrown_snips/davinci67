happy
birthday
all
day.
Sadly,
she
trudged
up
to
bed
that
night.
As
she
climbed
in,
though,
she
found
a
note
card
lying
on
her
pillow.
On
the
card
was
written
a
simple
riddle.
Even
before
she
solved
the
riddle,
she
was
smiling.
know
what
this
is!
Her
grandfather
had
done
this
for
her
last
Christmas
morning.
A
treasure
hunt!
Eagerly,
she
pored
over
the
riddle
until
she
solved
it.
The
solution
pointed
her
to
another
part
of
the
house,
where
she
found
another
card
and
another
riddle.
She
solved
this
one
too,
racing
on
to
the
next
card.
Running
wildly,
she
darted
back
and
forth
across
the
house,
from
clue
to
clue,
until
at
last
she
found
a
clue
that
directed
her
back
to
her
own
bedroom.
Sophie
dashed
up
the
stairs,
rushed
into
her
room,
and
stopped
in
her
tracks.
There
in
the
middle
of
the
room
sat
a
shining
red
bicycle
with
a
ribbon
tied
to
the
handlebars.
Sophie
shrieked
with
delight.
"I
know
you
asked
for
a
doll,"
her
grandfather
said,
smiling
in
the
corner.
"I
thought
you
might
like
this
even
better."
The
next
day,
her
grandfather
taught
her
to
ride,
running
beside
her
down
the
walkway.
When
Sophie
steered
out
over
the
thick
lawn
and
lost
her
balance,
they
both
went
tumbling
onto
the
grass,
rolling
and
laughing.
"Grand
pere,
"
Sophie
said,
hugging
him.
"I'm
really
sorry
about
the
key."
"I
know,
sweetie.
You're
forgiven.
I
can't
possibly
stay
mad
at
you.
Grandfathers
and
granddaughters
always
forgive
each
other.
Sophie
knew
she
shouldn't
ask,
but
she
couldn't
help
it.
"What
does
it
open?
I
never
saw
a
key
like
that.
It
was
very
pretty."
Her
grandfather
was
silent
a
long
moment,
and
Sophie
could
see
he
was
uncertain
how
to
answer.
Grand
pere
never
lies.
"It
opens
a
box,"
he
finally
said.
"Where
I
keep
many
secrets."
Sophie
pouted.
"I
hate
secrets!"
"I
know,
but
these
are
important
secrets.
And
someday,
you'll
learn
to
appreciate
them
as
much
as
I
do."
"I
saw
letters
on
the
key,
and
a
flower."
"Yes,
that's
my
favorite
flower.
It's
called
a
fleur
de
lis.
We
have
them
in
the
garden.
The
white
ones.
In
English
we
call
that
kind
of
flower
a
lily."
"I
know
those!
They're
my
favorite
too!"
"Then
I'll
make
a
deal
with
you."
Her
grandfather's
eyebrows
raised
the
way
they
always
did
when
he
was
about
to
give
her
a
challenge.
"If
you
can
keep
my
key
a
secret,
and
never
talk
about
it
ever
again,
to
me
or
anybody,
then
someday
I
will
give
it
to
you."
Sophie
couldn't
believe
her
ears.
"You
will?"
"I
promise.
When
the
time
comes,
the
key
will
be
yours.
It
has
your
name
on
it."
Sophie
scowled.
"No
it
doesn't.
It
said
P.S.
My
name
isn't
P.S.!"
Her
grandfather
lowered
his
voice
and
looked
around
as
if
to
make
sure
no
one
was
listening.
"Okay,
Sophie,
if
you
must
know,
P.S.
is
a
code.
It's
