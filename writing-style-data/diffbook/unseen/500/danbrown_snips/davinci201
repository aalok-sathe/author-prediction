my
lawyers."
He
scowled
toward
the
monk
in
the
rear
of
the
plane.
"That
animal
broke
into
my
home
and
almost
killed
me.
That
is
a
fact,
and
Remy
will
corroborate."
"But
you
tied
him
up
and
flew
him
to
London!"
Langdon
said.
Teabing
held
up
his
right
hand
and
feigned
a
courtroom
oath.
"Your
honor,
forgive
an
eccentric
old
knight
his
foolish
prejudice
for
the
British
court
system.
I
realize
I
should
have
called
the
French
authorities,
but
I'm
a
snob
and
do
not
trust
those
laissez
faire
French
to
prosecute
properly.
This
man
almost
murdered
me.
Yes,
I
made
a
rash
decision
forcing
my
manservant
to
help
me
bring
him
to
England,
but
I
was
under
great
stress.
Mea
culpa.
Mea
culpa."
Langdon
looked
incredulous.
"Coming
from
you,
Leigh,
that
just
might
fly."
"Sir?"
the
pilot
called
back.
"The
tower
just
radioed.
They've
got
some
kind
of
maintenance
problem
out
near
your
hangar,
and
they're
asking
me
to
bring
the
plane
directly
to
the
terminal
instead."
Teabing
had
been
flying
to
Biggin
Hill
for
over
a
decade,
and
this
was
a
first.
"Did
they
mention
what
the
problem
is?"
"The
controller
was
vague.
Something
about
a
gas
leak
at
the
pumping
station?
They
asked
me
to
park
in
front
of
the
terminal
and
keep
everyone
onboard
until
further
notice.
Safety
precaution.
We're
not
supposed
to
deplane
until
we
get
the
all
clear
from
airport
authorities."
Teabing
was
skeptical.
Must
be
one
hell
of
a
gas
leak.
The
pumping
station
was
a
good
half
mile
from
his
hangar.
Remy
also
looked
concerned.
"Sir,
this
sounds
highly
irregular."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie
and
Langdon.
"My
friends,
I
have
an
unpleasant
suspicion
that
we
are
about
to
be
met
by
a
welcoming
committee."
Langdon
gave
a
bleak
sigh.
"I
guess
Fache
still
thinks
I'm
his
man."
"Either
that,"
Sophie
said,
"or
he
is
too
deep
into
this
to
admit
his
error.
Teabing
was
not
listening.
Regardless
of
Fache's
mind
set,
action
needed
to
be
taken
fast.
Don't
lose
sight
of
the
ultimate
goal.
The
Grail.
We're
so
dose.
Below
them,
the
landing
gear
descended
with
a
clunk.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
sounding
deeply
remorseful,
"I
should
turn
myself
in
and
sort
this
out
legally.
Leave
you
all
out
of
it.
"Oh,
heavens,
Robert!"
Teabing
waved
it
off.
"Do
you
really
think
they're
going
to
let
the
rest
of
us
go?
I
just
transported
you
illegally.
Miss
Neveu
assisted
in
your
escape
from
the
Louvre,
and
we
have
a
man
tied
up
in
the
back
of
the
plane.
Really
now!
We're
all
in
this
together."
"Maybe
a
different
airport?"
Sophie
said.
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"If
we
pull
up
now,
by
the
time
we
get
clearance
anywhere
else,
our
welcoming
party
will
include
army
tanks."
Sophie
slumped.
Teabing
sensed
that
if
they
were
to
have
any
chance
of
postponing
confrontation
with
the
British
authorities
long
enough
to
find
the
Grail,
bold
action
had
to
be
taken.
"Give
me
a
minute,"
he
said,
hobbling
