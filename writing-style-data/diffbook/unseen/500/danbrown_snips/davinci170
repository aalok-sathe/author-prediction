to
look.
It
was
a
small
piece
of
wood,
like
a
puzzle
piece.
The
wooden
Rose
had
popped
out
of
the
lid
and
fallen
onto
the
desk.
Speechless,
Langdon
stared
at
the
bare
spot
on
the
lid
where
the
Rose
had
been.
There,
engraved
in
the
wood,
written
in
an
immaculate
hand,
were
four
lines
of
text
in
a
language
he
had
never
seen.
The
characters
look
vaguely
Semitic,
Langdon
thought
to
himself,
and
yet
I
don
't
recognize
the
language!
A
sudden
movement
behind
him
caught
his
attention.
Out
of
nowhere,
a
crushing
blow
to
the
head
knocked
Langdon
to
his
knees.
As
he
fell,
he
thought
for
a
moment
he
saw
a
pale
ghost
hovering
over
him,
clutching
a
gun.
Then
everything
went
black.
Sophie
Neveu,
despite
working
in
law
enforcement,
had
never
found
herself
at
gunpoint
until
tonight.
Almost
inconceivably,
the
gun
into
which
she
was
now
staring
was
clutched
in
the
pale
hand
of
an
enormous
albino
with
long
white
hair.
He
looked
at
her
with
red
eyes
that
radiated
a
frightening,
disembodied
quality.
Dressed
in
a
wool
robe
with
a
rope
tie,
he
resembled
a
medieval
cleric.
Sophie
could
not
imagine
who
he
was,
and
yet
she
was
feeling
a
sudden
newfound
respect
for
Teabing's
suspicions
that
the
Church
was
behind
this.
"You
know
what
I
have
come
for,"
the
monk
said,
his
voice
hollow.
Sophie
and
Teabing
were
seated
on
the
divan,
arms
raised
as
their
attacker
had
commanded.
Langdon
lay
groaning
on
the
floor.
The
monk's
eyes
fell
immediately
to
the
keystone
on
Teabing's
lap.
Teabing's
tone
was
defiant.
"You
will
not
be
able
to
open
it."
"My
Teacher
is
very
wise,"
the
monk
replied,
inching
closer,
the
gun
shifting
between
Teabing
and
Sophie.
Sophie
wondered
where
Teabing's
manservant
was.
Didn't
he
hear
Robert
fall?
"Who
is
your
teacher?"
Teabing
asked.
"Perhaps
we
can
make
a
financial
arrangement."
"The
Grail
is
priceless."
He
moved
closer.
"You're
bleeding,"
Teabing
noted
calmly,
nodding
to
the
monk's
right
ankle
where
a
trickle
of
blood
had
run
down
his
leg.
"And
you're
limping."
"As
do
you,"
the
monk
replied,
motioning
to
the
metal
crutches
propped
beside
Teabing.
"Now,
hand
me
the
keystone."
"You
know
of
the
keystone?"
Teabing
said,
sounding
surprised.
"Never
mind
what
I
know.
Stand
up
slowly,
and
give
it
to
me."
"Standing
is
difficult
for
me."
"Precisely.
I
would
prefer
nobody
attempt
any
quick
moves."
Teabing
slipped
his
right
hand
through
one
of
his
crutches
and
grasped
the
keystone
in
his
left.
Lurching
to
his
feet,
he
stood
erect,
palming
the
heavy
cylinder
in
his
left
hand,
and
leaning
unsteadily
on
his
crutch
with
his
right.
The
monk
closed
to
within
a
few
feet,
keeping
the
gun
aimed
directly
at
Teabing's
head.
Sophie
watched,
feeling
helpless
as
the
monk
reached
out
to
take
the
cylinder.
"You
will
not
succeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Only
the
worthy
can
unlock
this
stone."
God
alone
judges
the
worthy,
Silas
thought.
"It's
quite
heavy,"
the
man
on
crutches
said,
his
