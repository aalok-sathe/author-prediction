with
the
brand
name,
but
he
was
glad
to
hear
the
prophylactic
manufacturers
had
gotten
their
hieroglyphs
right.
"Well
done.
Amon
is
indeed
represented
as
a
man
with
a
ram's
head,
and
his
promiscuity
and
curved
horns
are
related
to
our
modern
sexual
slang
'horny.'
"No
shit!"
"No
shit,"
Langdon
said.
"And
do
you
know
who
Amon's
counterpart
was?
The
Egyptian
goddess
of
fertility?"
The
question
met
with
several
seconds
of
silence.
"It
was
Isis,"
Langdon
told
them,
grabbing
a
grease
pen.
"So
we
have
the
male
god,
Amon."
He
wrote
it
down.
"And
the
female
goddess,
Isis,
whose
ancient
pictogram
was
once
called
L'ISA."
Langdon
finished
writing
and
stepped
back
from
the
projector.
AMON
L'ISA
"Ring
any
bells?"
he
asked.
"Mona
Lisa
holy
crap,"
somebody
gasped.
Langdon
nodded.
"Gentlemen,
not
only
does
the
face
of
Mona
Lisa
look
androgynous,
but
her
name
is
an
anagram
of
the
divine
union
of
male
and
female.
And
that,
my
friends,
is
Da
Vinci's
little
secret,
and
the
reason
for
Mona
Lisa's
knowing
smile."
"My
grandfather
was
here,"
Sophie
said,
dropping
suddenly
to
her
knees,
now
only
ten
feet
from
the
Mona
Lisa.
She
pointed
the
black
light
tentatively
to
a
spot
on
the
parquet
floor.
At
first
Langdon
saw
nothing.
Then,
as
he
knelt
beside
her,
he
saw
a
tiny
droplet
of
dried
liquid
that
was
luminescing.
Ink?
Suddenly
he
recalled
what
black
lights
were
actually
used
for.
Blood.
His
senses
tingled.
Sophie
was
right.
Jacques
Sauniere
had
indeed
paid
a
visit
to
the
Mona
Lisa
before
he
died.
"He
wouldn't
have
come
here
without
a
reason,"
Sophie
whispered,
standing
up.
"I
know
he
left
a
message
for
me
here."
Quickly
striding
the
final
few
steps
to
the
Mona
Lisa,
she
illuminated
the
floor
directly
in
front
of
the
painting.
She
waved
the
light
back
and
forth
across
the
bare
parquet.
"There's
nothing
here!"
At
that
moment,
Langdon
saw
a
faint
purple
glimmer
on
the
protective
glass
before
the
Mona
Lisa.
Reaching
down,
he
took
Sophie's
wrist
and
slowly
moved
the
light
up
to
the
painting
itself.
They
both
froze.
On
the
glass,
six
words
glowed
in
purple,
scrawled
directly
across
the
Mona
Lisa's
face.
Seated
at
Sauniere's
desk,
Lieutenant
Collet
pressed
the
phone
to
his
ear
in
disbelief.
Did
I
hear
Fache
correctly?
"A
bar
of
soap?
But
how
could
Langdon
have
known
about
the
GPS
dot?"
"Sophie
Neveu,"
Fache
replied.
"She
told
him."
"What!
Why?"
"Damned
good
question,
but
I
just
heard
a
recording
that
confirms
she
tipped
him
off."
Collet
was
speechless.
What
was
Neveu
thinking?
Fache
had
proof
that
Sophie
had
interfered
with
a
DCPJ
sting
operation?
Sophie
Neveu
was
not
only
going
to
be
fired,
she
was
also
going
to
jail.
"But,
Captain
then
where
is
Langdon
now?"
"Have
any
fire
alarms
gone
off
there?"
"No,
sir."
"And
no
one
has
come
out
under
the
Grand
Gallery
gate?"
"No.
We've
got
a
Louvre
security
officer
on
the
gate.
Just
as
you
requested."
"Okay,
Langdon
must
still
be
