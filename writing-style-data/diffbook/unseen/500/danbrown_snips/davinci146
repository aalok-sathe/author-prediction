what
the
Grail
really
is?"
"Not
what
it
is,"
Teabing
whispered.
"But
rather
who
it
is.
The
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
thing.
It
is,
in
fact
a.
person"
Sophie
stared
at
Teabing
a
long
moment
and
then
turned
to
Langdon.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
a
person?"
Langdon
nodded.
"A
woman,
in
fact."
From
the
blank
look
on
Sophie's
face,
Langdon
could
tell
they
had
already
lost
her.
He
recalled
having
a
similar
reaction
the
first
time
he
heard
the
statement.
It
was
not
until
he
understood
the
symbology
behind
the
Grail
that
the
feminine
connection
became
clear.
Teabing
apparently
had
a
similar
thought.
"Robert,
perhaps
this
is
the
moment
for
the
symbologist
to
clarify?"
He
went
to
a
nearby
end
table,
found
a
piece
of
paper,
and
laid
it
in
front
of
Langdon.
Langdon
pulled
a
pen
from
his
pocket.
"Sophie,
are
you
familiar
with
the
modern
icons
for
male
and
female?"
He
drew
the
common
male
symbol
c?
and
female
symbol
.
"Of
course,"
she
said.
"These,"
he
said
quietly,
"are
not
the
original
symbols
for
male
and
female.
Many
people
incorrectly
assume
the
male
symbol
is
derived
from
a
shield
and
spear,
while
the
female
symbol
represents
a
mirror
reflecting
beauty.
In
fact,
the
symbols
originated
as
ancient
astronomical
symbols
for
the
planet
god
Mars
and
planet
goddess
Venus.
The
original
symbols
are
far
simpler."
Langdon
drew
another
icon
on
the
paper.
"This
symbol
is
the
original
icon
for
male,
"
he
told
her.
"A
rudimentary
phallus."
"Quite
to
the
point,"
Sophie
said.
"As
it
were,"
Teabing
added.
Langdon
went
on.
"This
icon
is
formally
known
as
the
blade,
and
it
represents
aggression
and
manhood.
In
fact,
this
exact
phallus
symbol
is
still
used
today
on
modern
military
uniforms
to
denote
rank."
"Indeed."
Teabing
grinned.
"The
more
penises
you
have,
the
higher
your
rank.
Boys
will
be
boys."
Langdon
winced.
"Moving
on,
the
female
symbol,
as
you
might
imagine,
is
the
exact
opposite."
He
drew
another
symbol
on
the
page.
"This
is
called
the
chalice.
Sophie
glanced
up,
looking
surprised.
Langdon
could
see
she
had
made
the
connection.
"The
chalice,"
he
said,
"resembles
a
cup
or
vessel,
and
more
important,
it
resembles
the
shape
of
a
woman's
womb.
This
symbol
communicates
femininity,
womanhood,
and
fertility."
Langdon
looked
directly
at
her
now.
"Sophie,
legend
tells
us
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
chalice
a
cup.
But
the
Grail's
description
as
a
chalice
is
actually
an
allegory
to
protect
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail.
That
is
to
say,
the
legend
uses
the
chalice
as
a
metaphor
for
something
far
more
important."
"A
woman,"
Sophie
said.
"Exactly."
Langdon
smiled.
"The
Grail
is
literally
the
ancient
symbol
for
womanhood,
and
the
Holy
Grail
represents
the
sacred
feminine
and
the
goddess,
which
of
course
has
now
been
lost,
virtually
eliminated
by
the
Church.
The
power
of
the
female
and
her
ability
to
produce
life
was
once
very
sacred,
but
it
posed
a
threat
to
the
rise
of
the
predominantly
male
Church,
