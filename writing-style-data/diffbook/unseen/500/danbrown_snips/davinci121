truck,
after
an
unnerving
pause
atop
the
bank
ramp,
had
moved
on,
snaking
left
and
right
for
a
minute
or
two,
and
was
now
accelerating
to
what
felt
like
top
speed.
Beneath
them,
the
bulletproof
tires
hummed
on
smooth
pavement.
Forcing
his
attention
to
the
rosewood
box
in
his
arms,
Langdon
laid
the
precious
bundle
on
the
floor,
unwrapped
his
jacket,
and
extracted
the
box,
pulling
it
toward
him.
Sophie
shifted
her
position
so
they
were
sitting
side
by
side.
Langdon
suddenly
felt
like
they
were
two
kids
huddled
over
a
Christmas
present.
In
contrast
to
the
warm
colors
of
the
rosewood
box,
the
inlaid
rose
had
been
crafted
of
a
pale
wood,
probably
ash,
which
shone
clearly
in
the
dim
light.
The
Rose.
Entire
armies
and
religions
had
been
built
on
this
symbol,
as
had
secret
societies.
The
Rosicrucians.
The
Knights
of
the
Rosy
Cross.
"Go
ahead,"
Sophie
said.
"Open
it."
Langdon
took
a
deep
breath.
Reaching
for
the
lid,
he
stole
one
more
admiring
glance
at
the
intricate
woodwork
and
then,
unhooking
the
clasp,
he
opened
the
lid,
revealing
the
object
within.
Langdon
had
harbored
several
fantasies
about
what
they
might
find
inside
this
box,
but
clearly
he
had
been
wrong
on
every
account.
Nestled
snugly
inside
the
box's
heavily
padded
interior
of
crimson
silk
lay
an
object
Langdon
could
not
even
begin
to
comprehend.
Crafted
of
polished
white
marble,
it
was
a
stone
cylinder
approximately
the
dimensions
of
a
tennis
ball
can.
More
complicated
than
a
simple
column
of
stone,
however,
the
cylinder
appeared
to
have
been
assembled
in
many
pieces.
Six
doughnutsized
disks
of
marble
had
been
stacked
and
affixed
to
one
another
within
a
delicate
brass
framework.
It
looked
like
some
kind
of
tubular,
multiwheeled
kaleidoscope.
Each
end
of
the
cylinder
was
affixed
with
an
end
cap,
also
marble,
making
it
impossible
to
see
inside.
Having
heard
liquid
within,
Langdon
assumed
the
cylinder
was
hollow.
As
mystifying
as
the
construction
of
the
cylinder
was,
however,
it
was
the
engravings
around
the
tube's
circumference
that
drew
Langdon's
primary
focus.
Each
of
the
six
disks
had
been
carefully
carved
with
the
same
unlikely
series
of
letters
the
entire
alphabet.
The
lettered
cylinder
reminded
Langdon
of
one
of
his
childhood
toys
a
rod
threaded
with
lettered
tumblers
that
could
be
rotated
to
spell
different
words.
"Amazing,
isn't
it?"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
glanced
up.
"I
don't
know.
What
the
hell
is
it?"
Now
there
was
a
glint
in
Sophie's
eye.
"My
grandfather
used
to
craft
these
as
a
hobby.
They
were
invented
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Even
in
the
diffuse
light,
Sophie
could
see
Langdon'
s
surprise.
"Da
Vinci?"
he
muttered,
looking
again
at
the
canister.
"Yes.
It's
called
a
cryptex.
According
to
my
grandfather,
the
blueprints
come
from
one
of
Da
Vinci's
secret
diaries."
"What
is
it
for?"
Considering
tonight's
events,
Sophie
knew
the
answer
might
have
some
interesting
implications.
"It's
a
vault,"
she
said.
"For
storing
secret
information."
Langdon's
eyes
widened
further.
Sophie
explained
that
creating
models
