Silas
gazed
blankly
at
the
floor
and
pondered
taking
his
own
life.
After
all,
it
had
been
Aringarosa
who
gave
Silas
life
in
the
first
place
in
that
small
rectory
in
Spain,
educating
him,
giving
him
purpose.
"My
friend,"
Aringarosa
had
told
him,
"you
were
born
an
albino.
Do
not
let
others
shame
you
for
this.
Do
you
not
understand
how
special
this
makes
you?
Were
you
not
aware
that
Noah
himself
was
an
albino?"
"Noah
of
the
Ark?"
Silas
had
never
heard
this.
Aringarosa
was
smiling.
"Indeed,
Noah
of
the
Ark.
An
albino.
Like
you,
he
had
skin
white
like
an
angel.
Consider
this.
Noah
saved
all
of
life
on
the
planet.
You
are
destined
for
great
things,
Silas.
The
Lord
has
freed
you
for
a
reason.
You
have
your
calling.
The
Lord
needs
your
help
to
do
His
work."
Over
time,
Silas
learned
to
see
himself
in
a
new
light.
am
pure.
White.
Beautiful.
Like
an
angel.
At
the
moment,
though,
in
his
room
at
the
residence
hall,
it
was
his
father's
disappointed
voice
that
whispered
to
him
from
the
past.
Tu
es
un
desastre.
Un
spectre.
Kneeling
on
the
wooden
floor,
Silas
prayed
for
forgiveness.
Then,
stripping
off
his
robe,
he
reached
again
for
the
Discipline.
Struggling
with
the
gear
shift,
Langdon
managed
to
maneuver
the
hijacked
taxi
to
the
far
side
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
while
stalling
only
twice.
Unfortunately,
the
inherent
humor
in
the
situation
was
overshadowed
by
the
taxi
dispatcher
repeatedly
hailing
their
cab
over
the
radio.
"Voiture
cinq
six
trois.
Oil
etes
vous?
Repondez!"
When
Langdon
reached
the
exit
of
the
park,
he
swallowed
his
machismo
and
jammed
on
the
brakes.
"You'd
better
drive."
Sophie
looked
relieved
as
she
jumped
behind
the
wheel.
Within
seconds
she
had
the
car
humming
smoothly
westward
along
Allee
de
Longchamp,
leaving
the
Garden
of
Earthly
Delights
behind.
"Which
way
is
Rue
Haxo?"
Langdon
asked,
watching
Sophie
edge
the
speedometer
over
a
hundred
kilometers
an
hour.
Sophie's
eyes
remained
focused
on
the
road.
"The
cab
driver
said
it's
adjacent
to
the
Roland
Garros
tennis
stadium.
I
know
that
area."
Langdon
pulled
the
heavy
key
from
his
pocket
again,
feeling
the
weight
in
his
palm.
He
sensed
it
was
an
object
of
enormous
consequence.
Quite
possibly
the
key
to
his
own
freedom.
Earlier,
while
telling
Sophie
about
the
Knights
Templar,
Langdon
had
realized
that
this
key,
in
addition
to
having
the
Priory
seal
embossed
on
it,
possessed
a
more
subtle
tie
to
the
Priory
of
Sion.
The
equal
armed
cruciform
was
symbolic
of
balance
and
harmony
but
also
of
the
Knights
Templar.
Everyone
had
seen
the
paintings
of
Knights
Templar
wearing
white
tunics
emblazoned
with
red
equal
armed
crosses.
Granted,
the
arms
of
the
Templar
cross
were
slightly
flared
at
the
ends,
but
they
were
still
of
equal
length.
A
square
cross.
Just
like
the
one
on
this
key.
Langdon
felt
his
imagination
starting
to
run
wild
as
he
fantasized
about
what
they
might
find.
The
Holy
Grail.
