Embedded
in
the
gray
granite
floor,
a
thin
polished
strip
of
brass
glistened
in
the
stone
a
golden
line
slanting
across
the
church's
floor.
The
line
bore
graduated
markings,
like
a
ruler.
It
was
a
gnomon,
Silas
had
been
told,
a
pagan
astronomical
device
like
a
sundial.
Tourists,
scientists,
historians,
and
pagans
from
around
the
world
came
to
Saint
Sulpice
to
gaze
upon
this
famous
line.
The
Rose
Line.
Slowly,
Silas
let
his
eyes
trace
the
path
of
the
brass
strip
as
it
made
its
way
across
the
floor
from
his
right
to
left,
slanting
in
front
of
him
at
an
awkward
angle,
entirely
at
odds
with
the
symmetry
of
the
church.
Slicing
across
the
main
altar
itself,
the
line
looked
to
Silas
like
a
slash
wound
across
a
beautiful
face.
The
strip
cleaved
the
communion
rail
in
two
and
then
crossed
the
entire
width
of
the
church,
finally
reaching
the
corner
of
the
north
transept,
where
it
arrived
at
the
base
of
a
most
unexpected
structure.
A
colossal
Egyptian
obelisk.
Here,
the
glistening
Rose
Line
took
a
ninety
degree
vertical
turn
and
continued
directly
up
the
face
of
the
obelisk
itself,
ascending
thirty
three
feet
to
the
very
tip
of
the
pyramidical
apex,
where
it
finally
ceased.
The
Rose
Line,
Silas
thought.
The
brotherhood
hid
the
keystone
at
the
Rose
Line.
Earlier
tonight,
when
Silas
told
the
Teacher
that
the
Priory
keystone
was
hidden
inside
Saint
Sulpice,
the
Teacher
had
sounded
doubtful.
But
when
Silas
added
that
the
brothers
had
all
given
him
a
precise
location,
with
relation
to
a
brass
line
running
through
Saint
Sulpice,
the
Teacher
had
gasped
with
revelation.
"You
speak
of
the
Rose
Line!"
The
Teacher
quickly
told
Silas
of
Saint
Sulpice's
famed
architectural
oddity
a
strip
of
brass
that
segmented
the
sanctuary
on
a
perfect
north
south
axis.
It
was
an
ancient
sundial
of
sorts,
a
vestige
of
the
pagan
temple
that
had
once
stood
on
this
very
spot.
The
sun's
rays,
shining
through
the
oculus
on
the
south
wall,
moved
farther
down
the
line
every
day,
indicating
the
passage
of
time,
from
solstice
to
solstice.
The
north
south
stripe
had
been
known
as
the
Rose
Line.
For
centuries,
the
symbol
of
the
Rose
had
been
associated
with
maps
and
guiding
souls
in
the
proper
direction.
The
Compass
Rose
drawn
on
almost
every
map
indicated
North,
East,
South,
and
West.
Originally
known
as
the
Wind
Rose,
it
denoted
the
directions
of
the
thirty
two
winds,
blowing
from
the
directions
of
eight
major
winds,
eight
half
winds,
and
sixteen
quarter
winds.
When
diagrammed
inside
a
circle,
these
thirty
two
points
of
the
compass
perfectly
resembled
a
traditional
thirty
two
petal
rose
bloom.
To
this
day,
the
fundamental
navigational
tool
was
still
known
as
a
Compass
Rose,
its
northernmost
direction
still
marked
by
an
arrowhead
or,
more
commonly,
the
symbol
of
the
fleur
de
lis.
On
a
globe,
a
Rose
Line
also
called
a
meridian
or
longitude
was
any
imaginary
line
drawn
from
the
North
Pole
