was
holding
the
door,
looking
impatient.
Langdon
exhaled,
turning
a
longing
glance
back
up
the
open
air
escalator.
Nothing's
wrong
at
all,
he
lied
to
himself,
trudging
back
toward
the
elevator.
As
a
boy,
Langdon
had
fallen
down
an
abandoned
well
shaft
and
almost
died
treading
water
in
the
narrow
space
for
hours
before
being
rescued.
Since
then,
he'd
suffered
a
haunting
phobia
of
enclosed
spaces
elevators,
subways,
squash
courts.
The
elevator
is
a
perfectly
safe
machine,
Langdon
continually
told
himself,
never
believing
it.
It's
a
tiny
metal
box
hanging
in
an
enclosed
shaft!
Holding
his
breath,
he
stepped
into
the
lift,
feeling
the
familiar
tingle
of
adrenaline
as
the
doors
slid
shut.
Two
floors.
Ten
seconds.
"You
and
Mr.
Sauniere,"
Fache
said
as
the
lift
began
to
move,
"you
never
spoke
at
all?
Never
corresponded?
Never
sent
each
other
anything
in
the
mail?"
Another
odd
question.
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"No.
Never."
Fache
cocked
his
head,
as
if
making
a
mental
note
of
that
fact.
Saying
nothing,
he
stared
dead
ahead
at
the
chrome
doors.
As
they
ascended,
Langdon
tried
to
focus
on
anything
other
than
the
four
walls
around
him.
In
the
reflection
of
the
shiny
elevator
door,
he
saw
the
captain's
tie
clip
a
silver
crucifix
with
thirteen
embedded
pieces
of
black
onyx.
Langdon
found
it
vaguely
surprising.
The
symbol
was
known
as
a
crux
gemmata
a
cross
bearing
thirteen
gems
a
Christian
ideogram
for
Christ
and
His
twelve
apostles.
Somehow
Langdon
had
not
expected
the
captain
of
the
French
police
to
broadcast
his
religion
so
openly.
Then
again,
this
was
France;
Christianity
was
not
a
religion
here
so
much
as
a
birthright.
"It's
a
crux
gemmata"
Fache
said
suddenly.
Startled,
Langdon
glanced
up
to
find
Fache's
eyes
on
him
in
the
reflection.
The
elevator
jolted
to
a
stop,
and
the
doors
opened.
Langdon
stepped
quickly
out
into
the
hallway,
eager
for
the
wide
open
space
afforded
by
the
famous
high
ceilings
of
the
Louvre
galleries.
The
world
into
which
he
stepped,
however,
was
nothing
like
he
expected.
Surprised,
Langdon
stopped
short.
Fache
glanced
over.
"I
gather,
Mr.
Langdon,
you
have
never
seen
the
Louvre
after
hours?"
guess
not,
Langdon
thought,
trying
to
get
his
bearings.
Usually
impeccably
illuminated,
the
Louvre
galleries
were
startlingly
dark
tonight.
Instead
of
the
customary
flat
white
light
flowing
down
from
above,
a
muted
red
glow
seemed
to
emanate
upward
from
the
baseboards
intermittent
patches
of
red
light
spilling
out
onto
the
tile
floors.
As
Langdon
gazed
down
the
murky
corridor,
he
realized
he
should
have
anticipated
this
scene.
Virtually
all
major
galleries
employed
red
service
lighting
at
night
strategically
placed,
low
level,
noninvasive
lights
that
enabled
staff
members
to
navigate
hallways
and
yet
kept
the
paintings
in
relative
darkness
to
slow
the
fading
effects
of
overexposure
to
light.
Tonight,
the
museum
possessed
an
almost
oppressive
quality.
Long
shadows
encroached
everywhere,
and
the
usually
soaring
vaulted
ceilings
appeared
as
a
low,
black
void.
"This
way,"
Fache
said,
turning
sharply
right
and
setting
