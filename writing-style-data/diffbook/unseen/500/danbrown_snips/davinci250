on
his
crutches,
gracelessly
keeping
the
gun
aimed
at
Sophie,
and
removed
the
keystone
from
his
pocket.
He
swayed
a
bit
as
he
held
it
out
for
Langdon.
"A
token
of
trust,
Robert."
Robert
felt
wary
and
didn't
move.
Leigh
is
giving
the
keystone
back
to
us?
"Take
it,"
Teabing
said,
thrusting
it
awkwardly
toward
Langdon.
Langdon
could
imagine
only
one
reason
Teabing
would
give
it
back.
"You
opened
it
already.
You
removed
the
map."
Teabing
was
shaking
his
head.
"Robert,
if
I
had
solved
the
keystone,
I
would
have
disappeared
to
find
the
Grail
myself
and
kept
you
uninvolved.
No,
I
do
not
know
the
answer.
And
I
can
admit
that
freely.
A
true
knight
learns
humility
in
the
face
of
the
Grail.
He
learns
to
obey
the
signs
placed
before
him.
When
I
saw
you
enter
the
abbey,
I
understood.
You
were
here
for
a
reason.
To
help.
I
am
not
looking
for
singular
glory
here.
I
serve
a
far
greater
master
than
my
own
pride.
The
Truth.
Mankind
deserves
to
know
that
truth.
The
Grail
found
us
all,
and
now
she
is
begging
to
be
revealed.
We
must
work
together."
Despite
Teabing's
pleas
for
cooperation
and
trust,
his
gun
remained
trained
on
Sophie
as
Langdon
stepped
forward
and
accepted
the
cold
marble
cylinder.
The
vinegar
inside
gurgled
as
Langdon
grasped
it
and
stepped
backward.
The
dials
were
still
in
random
order,
and
the
cryptex
remained
locked.
Langdon
eyed
Teabing.
"How
do
you
know
I
won't
smash
it
right
now?"
Teabing's
laugh
was
an
eerie
chortle.
"I
should
have
realized
your
threat
to
break
it
in
the
Temple
Church
was
an
empty
one.
Robert
Langdon
would
never
break
the
keystone.
You
are
an
historian,
Robert.
You
are
holding
the
key
to
two
thousand
years
of
history
the
lost
key
to
the
Sangreal.
You
can
feel
the
souls
of
all
the
knights
burned
at
the
stake
to
protect
her
secret.
Would
you
have
them
die
in
vain?
No,
you
will
vindicate
them.
You
will
join
the
ranks
of
the
great
men
you
admire
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Newton
each
of
whom
would
have
been
honored
to
be
in
your
shoes
right
now.
The
contents
of
the
keystone
are
crying
out
to
us.
Longing
to
be
set
free.
The
time
has
come.
Destiny
has
led
us
to
this
moment."
"I
cannot
help
you,
Leigh.
I
have
no
idea
how
to
open
this.
I
only
saw
Newton's
tomb
for
a
moment.
And
even
if
I
knew
the
password"
Langdon
paused,
realizing
he
had
said
too
much.
"You
would
not
tell
me?"
Teabing
sighed.
"I
am
disappointed
and
surprised,
Robert,
that
you
do
not
appreciate
the
extent
to
which
you
are
in
my
debt.
My
task
would
have
been
far
simpler
had
Remy
and
I
eliminated
you
both
when
you
walked
into
Chateau
Villette.
Instead
I
risked
everything
to
take
the
nobler
course."
"This
is
noble?"
Langdon
demanded,
eyeing
the
gun.
"Sauniere's
fault,"
Teabing
said.
"He
and
his
senechaux
lied
to
Silas.
Otherwise,
