on
the
wet
grass,
he
could
feel
a
warm
stream
of
blood
flowing
from
the
bullet
wound
below
his
ribs.
Still,
he
stared
straight
ahead.
The
fog
made
it
look
like
heaven
here.
Raising
his
bloody
hands
to
pray,
he
watched
the
raindrops
caress
his
fingers,
turning
them
white
again.
As
the
droplets
fell
harder
across
his
back
and
shoulders,
he
could
feel
his
body
disappearing
bit
by
bit
into
the
mist.
am
a
ghost.
A
breeze
rustled
past
him,
carrying
the
damp,
earthy
scent
of
new
life.
With
every
living
cell
in
his
broken
body,
Silas
prayed.
He
prayed
for
forgiveness.
He
prayed
for
mercy.
And,
above
all,
he
prayed
for
his
mentor
Bishop
Aringarosa
that
the
Lord
would
not
take
him
before
his
time.
He
has
so
much
work
left
to
do.
The
fog
was
swirling
around
him
now,
and
Silas
felt
so
light
that
he
was
sure
the
wisps
would
carry
him
away.
Closing
his
eyes,
he
said
a
final
prayer.
From
somewhere
in
the
mist,
the
voice
of
Manuel
Aringarosa
whispered
to
him.
Our
Lord
is
a
good
and
merciful
God.
Silas's
pain
at
last
began
to
fade,
and
he
knew
the
bishop
was
right.
It
was
late
afternoon
when
the
London
sun
broke
through
and
the
city
began
to
dry.
Bezu
Fache
felt
weary
as
he
emerged
from
the
interrogation
room
and
hailed
a
cab.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
vociferously
proclaimed
his
innocence,
and
yet
from
his
incoherent
rantings
about
the
Holy
Grail,
secret
documents,
and
mysterious
brotherhoods,
Fache
suspected
the
wily
historian
was
setting
the
stage
for
his
lawyers
to
plead
an
insanity
defense.
Sure,
Fache
thought.
Insane.
Teabing
had
displayed
ingenious
precision
in
formulating
a
plan
that
protected
his
innocence
at
every
turn.
He
had
exploited
both
the
Vatican
and
Opus
Dei,
two
groups
that
turned
out
to
be
completely
innocent.
His
dirty
work
had
been
carried
out
unknowingly
by
a
fanatical
monk
and
a
desperate
bishop.
More
clever
still,
Teabing
had
situated
his
electronic
listening
post
in
the
one
place
a
man
with
polio
could
not
possibly
reach.
The
actual
surveillance
had
been
carried
out
by
his
manservant,
Remy
the
lone
person
privy
to
Teabing's
true
identity
now
conveniently
dead
of
an
allergic
reaction.
Hardly
the
handiwork
of
someone
lacking
mental
faculties,
Fache
thought.
The
information
coming
from
Collet
out
of
Chateau
Villette
suggested
that
Teabing's
cunning
ran
so
deep
that
Fache
himself
might
even
learn
from
it.
To
successfully
hide
bugs
in
some
of
Paris's
most
powerful
offices,
the
British
historian
had
turned
to
the
Greeks.
Trojan
horses.
Some
of
Teabing's
intended
targets
received
lavish
gifts
of
artwork,
others
unwittingly
bid
at
auctions
in
which
Teabing
had
placed
specific
lots.
In
Sauniere's
case,
the
curator
had
received
a
dinner
invitation
to
Chateau
Villette
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
Teabing's
funding
a
new
Da
Vinci
Wing
at
the
Louvre.
Sauniere's
invitation
had
contained
an
innocuous
postscript
expressing
fascination
with
a
robotic
knight
that
Sauniere
was
rumored
to
have
built.
Bring
