terrain."
"Urn,
sir?"
The
agent
pointed
to
a
nearby
pegboard
on
which
hung
several
sets
of
keys.
The
labels
above
the
keys
bore
familiar
names.
DAIMLER
ROLLS
ROYCE
ASTIN
MARTIN
PORSCHE
The
last
peg
was
empty.
When
Collet
read
the
label
above
the
empty
peg,
he
knew
he
was
in
trouble.
The
Range
Rover
was
Java
Black
Pearl,
four
wheel
drive,
standard
transmission,
with
high
strength
polypropylene
lamps,
rear
light
cluster
fittings,
and
the
steering
wheel
on
the
right.
Langdon
was
pleased
he
was
not
driving.
Teabing's
manservant
Remy,
on
orders
from
his
master,
was
doing
an
impressive
job
of
maneuvering
the
vehicle
across
the
moonlit
fields
behind
Chateau
Villette.
With
no
headlights,
he
had
crossed
an
open
knoll
and
was
now
descending
a
long
slope,
moving
farther
away
from
the
estate.
He
seemed
to
be
heading
toward
a
jagged
silhouette
of
wooded
land
in
the
distance.
Langdon,
cradling
the
keystone,
turned
in
the
passenger
seat
and
eyed
Teabing
and
Sophie
in
the
back
seat.
"How's
your
head,
Robert?"
Sophie
asked,
sounding
concerned.
Langdon
forced
a
pained
smile.
"Better,
thanks."
It
was
killing
him.
Beside
her,
Teabing
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
bound
and
gagged
monk
lying
in
the
cramped
luggage
area
behind
the
back
seat.
Teabing
had
the
monk's
gun
on
his
lap
and
looked
like
an
old
photo
of
a
British
safari
chap
posing
over
his
kill.
"So
glad
you
popped
in
this
evening,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
grinning
as
if
he
were
having
fun
for
the
first
time
in
years.
"Sorry
to
get
you
involved
in
this,
Leigh."
"Oh,
please,
I've
waited
my
entire
life
to
be
involved."
Teabing
looked
past
Langdon
out
the
windshield
at
the
shadow
of
a
long
hedgerow.
He
tapped
Remy
on
the
shoulder
from
behind.
"Remember,
no
brake
lights.
Use
the
emergency
brake
if
you
need
it.
I
want
to
get
into
the
woods
a
bit.
No
reason
to
risk
them
seeing
us
from
the
house."
Remy
coasted
to
a
crawl
and
guided
the
Range
Rover
through
an
opening
in
the
hedge.
As
the
vehicle
lurched
onto
an
overgrown
pathway,
almost
immediately
the
trees
overhead
blotted
out
the
moonlight.
can
't
see
a
thing,
Langdon
thought,
straining
to
distinguish
any
shapes
at
all
in
front
of
them.
It
was
pitch
black.
Branches
rubbed
against
the
left
side
of
the
vehicle,
and
Remy
corrected
in
the
other
direction.
Keeping
the
wheel
more
or
less
straight
now,
he
inched
ahead
about
thirty
yards.
"You're
doing
beautifully,
Remy,"
Teabing
said.
"That
should
be
far
enough.
Robert,
if
you
could
press
that
little
blue
button
just
below
the
vent
there.
See
it?"
Langdon
found
the
button
and
pressed
it.
A
muted
yellow
glow
fanned
out
across
the
path
in
front
of
them,
revealing
thick
underbrush
on
either
side
of
the
pathway.
Fog
lights,
Langdon
realized.
They
gave
off
just
enough
light
to
keep
them
on
the
path,
and
yet
they
were
deep
enough
into
the
woods
now
that
the
lights
would
not
give
them
away.
"Well,
