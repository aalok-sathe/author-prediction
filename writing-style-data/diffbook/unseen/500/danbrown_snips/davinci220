filled
with
anger
and
frustration,
and
Remy
tightened
with
fear
that
Silas
might
actually
shoot
Langdon
while
he
was
holding
the
cryptex.
The
cryptex
cannot
fall!
The
cryptex
was
to
be
Remy's
ticket
to
freedom
and
wealth.
A
little
over
a
year
ago,
he
was
simply
a
fifty
five
year
old
manservant
living
within
the
walls
of
Chateau
Villette,
catering
to
the
whims
of
the
insufferable
cripple
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
Then
he
was
approached
with
an
extraordinary
proposition.
Remy's
association
with
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
the
preeminent
Grail
historian
on
earth
was
going
to
bring
Remy
everything
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
in
life.
Since
then,
every
moment
he
had
spent
inside
Chateau
Villette
had
been
leading
him
to
this
very
instant.
am
so
close,
Remy
told
himself,
gazing
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
Temple
Church
and
the
keystone
in
Robert
Langdon's
hand.
If
Langdon
dropped
it,
all
would
be
lost.
Am
I
willing
to
show
my
face?
It
was
something
the
Teacher
had
strictly
forbidden.
Remy
was
the
only
one
who
knew
the
Teacher's
identity.
"Are
you
certain
you
want
Silas
to
carry
out
this
task?"
Remy
had
asked
the
Teacher
less
than
half
an
hour
ago,
upon
getting
orders
to
steal
the
keystone.
"I
myself
am
capable."
The
Teacher
was
resolute.
"Silas
served
us
well
with
the
four
Priory
members.
He
will
recover
the
keystone.
You
must
remain
anonymous.
If
others
see
you,
they
will
need
to
be
eliminated,
and
there
has
been
enough
killing
already.
Do
not
reveal
your
face."
My
face
will
change,
Remy
thought.
With
what
you've
promised
to
pay
me,
I
will
become
an
entirely
new
man.
Surgery
could
even
change
his
fingerprints,
the
Teacher
had
told
him.
Soon
he
would
be
free
another
unrecognizable,
beautiful
face
soaking
up
the
sun
on
the
beach.
"Understood,"
Remy
said.
"I
will
assist
Silas
from
the
shadows."
"For
your
own
knowledge,
Remy,"
the
Teacher
had
told
him,
"the
tomb
in
question
is
not
in
the
Temple
Church.
So
have
no
fear.
They
are
looking
in
the
wrong
place."
Remy
was
stunned.
"And
you
know
where
the
tomb
is?"
"Of
course.
Later,
I
will
tell
you.
For
the
moment,
you
must
act
quickly.
If
the
others
figure
out
the
true
location
of
the
tomb
and
leave
the
church
before
you
take
the
cryptex,
we
could
lose
the
Grail
forever."
Remy
didn't
give
a
damn
about
the
Grail,
except
that
the
Teacher
refused
to
pay
him
until
it
was
found.
Remy
felt
giddy
every
time
he
thought
of
the
money
he
soon
would
have.
One
third
of
twenty
million
euro.
Plenty
to
disappear
forever.
Remy
had
pictured
the
beach
towns
on
the
Cote
d'Azur,
where
he
planned
to
live
out
his
days
basking
in
the
sun
and
letting
others
serve
him
for
a
change.
Now,
however,
here
in
the
Temple
Church,
with
Langdon
threatening
to
break
the
keystone,
Remy's
future
was
at
risk.
Unable
to
bear
the
thought
of
coming
this
close
only
to
lose
it
all,
Remy
made
the
