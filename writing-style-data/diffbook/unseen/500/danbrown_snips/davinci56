said
a
young
woman
in
the
front
row.
"I'm
a
bio
major
and
I've
never
seen
this
Divine
Proportion
in
nature."
"No?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Ever
study
the
relationship
between
females
and
males
in
a
honeybee
community?"
"Sure.
The
female
bees
always
outnumber
the
male
bees."
"Correct.
And
did
you
know
that
if
you
divide
the
number
of
female
bees
by
the
number
of
male
bees
in
any
beehive
in
the
world,
you
always
get
the
same
number?"
"You
do?"
"Yup.
PHI."
The
girl
gaped.
"NO
WAY!"
"Way!"
Langdon
fired
back,
smiling
as
he
projected
a
slide
of
a
spiral
seashell.
"Recognize
this?"
"It's
a
nautilus,"
the
bio
major
said.
"A
cephalopod
mollusk
that
pumps
gas
into
its
chambered
shell
to
adjust
its
buoyancy."
"Correct.
And
can
you
guess
what
the
ratio
is
of
each
spiral's
diameter
to
the
next?"
The
girl
looked
uncertain
as
she
eyed
the
concentric
arcs
of
the
nautilus
spiral.
Langdon
nodded.
"PHI.
The
Divine
Proportion.
One
point
six
one
eight
to
one."
The
girl
looked
amazed.
Langdon
advanced
to
the
next
slide
a
close
up
of
a
sunflower's
seed
head.
"Sunflower
seeds
grow
in
opposing
spirals.
Can
you
guess
the
ratio
of
each
rotation's
diameter
to
the
next?"
"PHI?"
everyone
said.
"Bingo."
Langdon
began
racing
through
slides
now
spiraled
pinecone
petals,
leaf
arrangement
on
plant
stalks,
insect
segmentation
all
displaying
astonishing
obedience
to
the
Divine
Proportion.
"This
is
amazing!"
someone
cried
out.
"Yeah,"
someone
else
said,
"but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
art?"
"Aha!"
Langdon
said.
"Glad
you
asked."
He
pulled
up
another
slide
a
pale
yellow
parchment
displaying
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
famous
male
nude
The
Vitruvian
Man
named
for
Marcus
Vitruvius,
the
brilliant
Roman
architect
who
praised
the
Divine
Proportion
in
his
text
De
Architectura.
"Nobody
understood
better
than
Da
Vinci
the
divine
structure
of
the
human
body.
Da
Vinci
actually
exhumed
corpses
to
measure
the
exact
proportions
of
human
bone
structure.
He
was
the
first
to
show
that
the
human
body
is
literally
made
of
building
blocks
whose
proportional
ratios
always
equal
PHI."
Everyone
in
class
gave
him
a
dubious
look.
"Don't
believe
me?"
Langdon
challenged.
"Next
time
you're
in
the
shower,
take
a
tape
measure."
A
couple
of
football
players
snickered.
"Not
just
you
insecure
jocks,"
Langdon
prompted.
"All
of
you.
Guys
and
girls.
Try
it.
Measure
the
distance
from
the
tip
of
your
head
to
the
floor.
Then
divide
that
by
the
distance
from
your
belly
button
to
the
floor.
Guess
what
number
you
get."
"Not
PHI!"
one
of
the
jocks
blurted
out
in
disbelief.
"Yes,
PHI,"
Langdon
replied.
"One
point
six
one
eight.
Want
another
example?
Measure
the
distance
from
your
shoulder
to
your
fingertips,
and
then
divide
it
by
the
distance
from
your
elbow
to
your
fingertips.
PHI
again.
Another?
Hip
to
floor
divided
by
knee
to
floor.
PHI
again.
Finger
joints.
Toes.
Spinal
divisions.
PHI.
PHI.
PHI.
My
friends,
each
of
you
is
a
walking
tribute
to
the
Divine
Proportion.
Even
in
the
darkness,
Langdon
could
see
