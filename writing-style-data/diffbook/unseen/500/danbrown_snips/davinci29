critical
juncture.
He
gave
Langdon
a
calm
look
of
apology.
"One
moment
please."
He
pulled
the
phone
from
his
belt
and
pressed
the
radio
transmission
button.
"Oui?"
"Capitaine,
un
agent
du
Departement
de
Cryptographic
est
arrive.
Fache's
anger
stalled
momentarily.
A
cryptographer?
Despite
the
lousy
timing,
this
was
probably
good
news.
Fache,
after
finding
Sauniere's
cryptic
text
on
the
floor,
had
uploaded
photographs
of
the
entire
crime
scene
to
the
Cryptography
Department
in
hopes
someone
there
could
tell
him
what
the
hell
Sauniere
was
trying
to
say.
If
a
code
breaker
had
now
arrived,
it
most
likely
meant
someone
had
decrypted
Sauniere's
message.
"I'm
busy
at
the
moment,"
Fache
radioed
back,
leaving
no
doubt
in
his
tone
that
a
line
had
been
crossed.
"Ask
the
cryptographer
to
wait
at
the
command
post.
I'll
speak
to
him
when
I'm
done."
"Her,
"
the
voice
corrected.
"It's
Agent
Neveu."
Fache
was
becoming
less
amused
with
this
call
every
passing
moment.
Sophie
Neveu
was
one
of
DCPJ's
biggest
mistakes.
A
young
Parisian
dechiffreuse
who
had
studied
cryptography
in
England
at
the
Royal
Holloway,
Sophie
Neveu
had
been
foisted
on
Fache
two
years
ago
as
part
of
the
ministry's
attempt
to
incorporate
more
women
into
the
police
force.
The
ministry's
ongoing
foray
into
political
correctness,
Fache
argued,
was
weakening
the
department.
Women
not
only
lacked
the
physicality
necessary
for
police
work,
but
their
mere
presence
posed
a
dangerous
distraction
to
the
men
in
the
field.
As
Fache
had
feared,
Sophie
Neveu
was
proving
far
more
distracting
than
most.
At
thirty
two
years
old,
she
had
a
dogged
determination
that
bordered
on
obstinate.
Her
eager
espousal
of
Britain's
new
cryptologic
methodology
continually
exasperated
the
veteran
French
cryptographers
above
her.
And
by
far
the
most
troubling
to
Fache
was
the
inescapable
universal
truth
that
in
an
office
of
middle
aged
men,
an
attractive
young
woman
always
drew
eyes
away
from
the
work
at
hand.
The
man
on
the
radio
said,
"Agent
Neveu
insisted
on
speaking
to
you
immediately,
Captain.
I
tried
to
stop
her,
but
she's
on
her
way
into
the
gallery.
Fache
recoiled
in
disbelief.
"Unacceptable!
I
made
it
very
clear
For
a
moment,
Robert
Langdon
thought
Bezu
Fache
was
suffering
a
stroke.
The
captain
was
mid
sentence
when
his
jaw
stopped
moving
and
his
eyes
bulged.
His
blistering
gaze
seemed
fixated
on
something
over
Langdon's
shoulder.
Before
Langdon
could
turn
to
see
what
it
was,
he
heard
a
woman's
voice
chime
out
behind
him.
"Excusez
moi,
messieurs.
Langdon
turned
to
see
a
young
woman
approaching.
She
was
moving
down
the
corridor
toward
them
with
long,
fluid
strides
a
haunting
certainty
to
her
gait.
Dressed
casually
in
a
knee
length,
cream
colored
Irish
sweater
over
black
leggings,
she
was
attractive
and
looked
to
be
about
thirty.
Her
thick
burgundy
hair
fell
unstyled
to
her
shoulders,
framing
the
warmth
of
her
face.
Unlike
the
waifish,
cookie
cutter
blondes
that
adorned
Harvard
dorm
room
walls,
this
woman
was
healthy
with
an
unembellished
beauty
and
genuineness
that
radiated
