is
that?
What
happened?"
Teabing
hobbled
over.
"You
were
rescued
by
a
knight
brandishing
an
Excalibur
made
by
Acme
Orthopedic."
Huh?
Langdon
tried
to
sit
up.
Sophie's
touch
was
shaken
but
tender.
"Just
give
yourself
a
minute,
Robert."
"I
fear,"
Teabing
said,
"that
I've
just
demonstrated
for
your
lady
friend
the
unfortunate
benefit
of
my
condition.
It
seems
everyone
underestimates
you."
From
his
seat
on
the
divan,
Langdon
gazed
down
at
the
monk
and
tried
to
imagine
what
had
happened.
"He
was
wearing
a
cilice,
"
Teabing
explained.
"A
what?"
Teabing
pointed
to
a
bloody
strip
of
barbed
leather
that
lay
on
the
floor.
"A
Discipline
belt.
He
wore
it
on
his
thigh.
I
took
careful
aim."
Langdon
rubbed
his
head.
He
knew
of
Discipline
belts.
"But
how
did
you
know?"
Teabing
grinned.
"Christianity
is
my
field
of
study,
Robert,
and
there
are
certain
sects
who
wear
their
hearts
on
their
sleeves."
He
pointed
his
crutch
at
the
blood
soaking
through
the
monk's
cloak.
"As
it
were."
"Opus
Dei,"
Langdon
whispered,
recalling
recent
media
coverage
of
several
prominent
Boston
businessmen
who
were
members
of
Opus
Dei.
Apprehensive
coworkers
had
falsely
and
publicly
accused
the
men
of
wearing
Discipline
belts
beneath
their
three
piece
suits.
In
fact,
the
three
men
did
no
such
thing.
Like
many
members
of
Opus
Dei,
these
businessmen
were
at
the
"supernumerary"
stage
and
practiced
no
corporal
mortification
at
all.
They
were
devout
Catholics,
caring
fathers
to
their
children,
and
deeply
dedicated
members
of
the
community.
Not
surprisingly,
the
media
spotlighted
their
spiritual
commitment
only
briefly
before
moving
on
to
the
shock
value
of
the
sect's
more
stringent
"numerary"
members
members
like
the
monk
now
lying
on
the
floor
before
Langdon.
Teabing
was
looking
closely
at
the
bloody
belt.
"But
why
would
Opus
Dei
be
trying
to
find
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
was
too
groggy
to
consider
it.
"Robert,"
Sophie
said,
walking
to
the
wooden
box.
"What's
this?"
She
was
holding
the
small
Rose
inlay
he
had
removed
from
the
lid.
"It
covered
an
engraving
on
the
box.
I
think
the
text
might
tell
us
how
to
open
the
keystone."
Before
Sophie
and
Teabing
could
respond,
a
sea
of
blue
police
lights
and
sirens
erupted
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
began
snaking
up
the
half
mile
driveway.
Teabing
frowned.
"My
friends,
it
seems
we
have
a
decision
to
make.
And
we'd
better
make
it
fast."
Collet
and
his
agents
burst
through
the
front
door
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
estate
with
their
guns
drawn.
Fanning
out,
they
began
searching
all
the
rooms
on
the
first
level.
They
found
a
bullet
hole
in
the
drawing
room
floor,
signs
of
a
struggle,
a
small
amount
of
blood,
a
strange,
barbed
leather
belt,
and
a
partially
used
roll
of
duct
tape.
The
entire
level
seemed
deserted.
Just
as
Collet
was
about
to
divide
his
men
to
search
the
basement
and
grounds
behind
the
house,
he
heard
voices
on
the
level
above
them.
"They're
upstairs!"
Rushing
up
the
wide
staircase,
