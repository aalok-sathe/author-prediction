has
recently
passed,
and
with
it
has
ended
the
two
thousand
year
long
astrological
Age
of
Pisces
the
fish,
which
is
also
the
sign
of
Jesus.
As
any
astrological
symbologist
will
tell
you,
the
Piscean
ideal
believes
that
man
must
be
told
what
to
do
by
higher
powers
because
man
is
incapable
of
thinking
for
himself.
Hence
it
has
been
a
time
of
fervent
religion.
Now,
however,
we
are
entering
the
Age
of
Aquarius
the
water
bearer
whose
ideals
claim
that
man
will
learn
the
truth
and
be
able
to
think
for
himself.
The
ideological
shift
is
enormous,
and
it
is
occurring
right
now."
Langdon
felt
a
shiver.
Astrological
prophecy
never
held
much
interest
or
credibility
for
him,
but
he
knew
there
were
those
in
the
Church
who
followed
it
very
closely.
"The
Church
calls
this
transitional
period
the
End
of
Days."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"As
in
the
end
of
the
world?
The
Apocalypse?"
"No."
Langdon
replied.
"That's
a
common
misconception.
Many
religions
speak
of
the
End
of
Days.
It
refers
not
to
the
end
of
the
world,
but
rather
the
end
of
our
current
age
Pisces,
which
began
at
the
time
of
Christ's
birth,
spanned
two
thousand
years,
and
waned
with
the
passing
of
the
millennium.
Now
that
we've
passed
into
the
Age
of
Aquarius,
the
End
of
Days
has
arrived."
"Many
Grail
historians,"
Teabing
added,
"believe
that
"the
Priory
is
indeed
planning
to
release
this
truth,
this
point
in
history
would
be
a
symbolically
apt
time.
Most
Priory
academics,
myself
included,
anticipated
the
brotherhood's
release
would
coincide
precisely
with
the
millennium.
Obviously,
it
did
not.
Admittedly,
the
Roman
calendar
does
not
mesh
perfectly
with
astrological
markers,
so
there
is
some
gray
area
in
the
prediction.
Whether
the
Church
now
has
inside
information
that
an
exact
date
is
looming,
or
whether
they
are
just
getting
nervous
on
account
of
astrological
prophecy,
I
don't
know.
Anyway,
it's
immaterial.
Either
scenario
explains
how
the
Church
might
be
motivated
to
launch
a
preemptive
attack
against
the
Priory."
Teabing
frowned.
"And
believe
me,
if
the
Church
finds
the
Holy
Grail,
they
will
destroy
it.
The
documents
and
the
relics
of
the
blessed
Mary
Magdalene
as
well."
His
eyes
grew
heavy.
"Then,
my
dear,
with
the
Sangreal
documents
gone,
all
evidence
will
be
lost.
The
Church
will
have
won
their
age
old
war
to
rewrite
history.
The
past
will
be
erased
forever."
Slowly,
Sophie
pulled
the
cruciform
key
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
Teabing.
Teabing
took
the
key
and
studied
it.
"My
goodness.
The
Priory
seal.
Where
did
you
get
this?"
"My
grandfather
gave
it
to
me
tonight
before
he
died."
Teabing
ran
his
fingers
across
the
cruciform.
"A
key
to
a
church?"
She
drew
a
deep
breath.
"This
key
provides
access
to
the
keystone."
Teabing's
head
snapped
up,
his
face
wild
with
disbelief.
"Impossible!
What
church
did
I
miss?
I've
searched
every
church
in
France!"
"It's
not
in
a
church,"
Sophie
said.
"It's
in
a
Swiss
depository
bank."
