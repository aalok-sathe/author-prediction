attempting
to
bring
education
into
the
prison
system
Culture
for
Convicts,
as
Langdon's
colleagues
liked
to
call
it.
Standing
at
an
overhead
projector
in
a
darkened
penitentiary
library,
Langdon
had
shared
the
Mona
Lisa's
secret
with
the
prisoners
attending
class,
men
whom
he
found
surprisingly
engaged
rough,
but
sharp.
"You
may
notice,"
Langdon
told
them,
walking
up
to
the
projected
image
of
the
Mona
Lisa
on
the
library
wall,
"that
the
background
behind
her
face
is
uneven."
Langdon
motioned
to
the
glaring
discrepancy.
"Da
Vinci
painted
the
horizon
line
on
the
left
significantly
lower
than
the
right."
"He
screwed
it
up?"
one
of
the
inmates
asked.
Langdon
chuckled.
"No.
Da
Vinci
didn't
do
that
too
often.
Actually,
this
is
a
little
trick
Da
Vinci
played.
By
lowering
the
countryside
on
the
left,
Da
Vinci
made
Mona
Lisa
look
much
larger
from
the
left
side
than
from
the
right
side.
A
little
Da
Vinci
inside
joke.
Historically,
the
concepts
of
male
and
female
have
assigned
sides
left
is
female,
and
right
is
male.
Because
Da
Vinci
was
a
big
fan
of
feminine
principles,
he
made
Mona
Lisa
look
more
majestic
from
the
left
than
the
right."
"I
heard
he
was
a
fag,"
said
a
small
man
with
a
goatee.
Langdon
winced.
"Historians
don't
generally
put
it
quite
that
way,
but
yes,
Da
Vinci
was
a
homosexual."
"Is
that
why
he
was
into
that
whole
feminine
thing?"
"Actually,
Da
Vinci
was
in
tune
with
the
balance
between
male
and
female.
He
believed
that
a
human
soul
could
not
be
enlightened
unless
it
had
both
male
and
female
elements."
"You
mean
like
chicks
with
dicks?"
someone
called.
This
elicited
a
hearty
round
of
laughs.
Langdon
considered
offering
an
etymological
sidebar
about
the
word
hermaphrodite
and
its
ties
to
Hermes
and
Aphrodite,
but
something
told
him
it
would
be
lost
on
this
crowd.
"Hey,
Mr.
Langford,"
a
muscle
bound
man
said.
"Is
it
true
that
the
Mona
Lisa
is
a
picture
of
Da
Vinci
in
drag?
I
heard
that
was
true."
"It's
quite
possible,"
Langdon
said.
"Da
Vinci
was
a
prankster,
and
computerized
analysis
of
the
Mona
Lisa
and
Da
Vinci's
self
portraits
confirm
some
startling
points
of
congruency
in
their
faces.
Whatever
Da
Vinci
was
up
to,"
Langdon
said,
"his
Mona
Lisa
is
neither
male
nor
female.
It
carries
a
subtle
message
of
androgyny.
It
is
a
fusing
of
both."
"You
sure
that's
not
just
some
Harvard
bullshit
way
of
saying
Mona
Lisa
is
one
ugly
chick."
Now
Langdon
laughed.
"You
may
be
right.
But
actually
Da
Vinci
left
a
big
clue
that
the
painting
was
supposed
to
be
androgynous.
Has
anyone
here
ever
heard
of
an
Egyptian
god
named
Anion?"
"Hell
yes!"
the
big
guy
said.
"God
of
masculine
fertility!"
Langdon
was
stunned.
"It
says
so
on
every
box
of
Amon
condoms."
The
muscular
man
gave
a
wide
grin.
"It's
got
a
guy
with
a
ram's
head
on
the
front
and
says
he's
the
Egyptian
god
of
fertility."
Langdon
was
not
familiar
