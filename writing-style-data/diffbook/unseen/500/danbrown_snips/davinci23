the
message
again
and
looked
up
at
Fache.
"What
the
hell
does
this
mean!"
Fache's
eyes
shone
white.
"That,
monsieur,
is
precisely
the
question
you
are
here
to
answer."
Not
far
away,
inside
Sauniere's
office,
Lieutenant
Collet
had
returned
to
the
Louvre
and
was
huddled
over
an
audio
console
set
up
on
the
curator's
enormous
desk.
With
the
exception
of
the
eerie,
robot
like
doll
of
a
medieval
knight
that
seemed
to
be
staring
at
him
from
the
corner
of
Sauniere's
desk,
Collet
was
comfortable.
He
adjusted
his
AKG
headphones
and
checked
the
input
levels
on
the
hard
disk
recording
system.
All
systems
were
go.
The
microphones
were
functioning
flawlessly,
and
the
audio
feed
was
crystal
clear.
he
moment
de
verite,
he
mused.
Smiling,
he
closed
his
eyes
and
settled
in
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
conversation
now
being
taped
inside
the
Grand
Gallery.
The
modest
dwelling
within
the
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice
was
located
on
the
second
floor
of
the
church
itself,
to
the
left
of
the
choir
balcony.
A
two
room
suite
with
a
stone
floor
and
minimal
furnishings,
it
had
been
home
to
Sister
Sandrine
Bieil
for
over
a
decade.
The
nearby
convent
was
her
formal
residence,
if
anyone
asked,
but
she
preferred
the
quiet
of
the
church
and
had
made
herself
quite
comfortable
upstairs
with
a
bed,
phone,
and
hot
plate.
As
the
church's
conservatrice
d'affaires,
Sister
Sandrine
was
responsible
for
overseeing
all
nonreligious
aspects
of
church
operations
general
maintenance,
hiring
support
staff
and
guides,
securing
the
building
after
hours,
and
ordering
supplies
like
communion
wine
and
wafers.
Tonight,
asleep
in
her
small
bed,
she
awoke
to
the
shrill
of
her
telephone.
Tiredly,
she
lifted
the
receiver.
"Soeur
Sandrine.
Eglise
Saint
Sulpice.
"Hello,
Sister,"
the
man
said
in
French.
Sister
Sandrine
sat
up.
What
time
is
it?
Although
she
recognized
her
boss's
voice,
in
fifteen
years
she
had
never
been
awoken
by
him.
The
abbe
was
a
deeply
pious
man
who
went
home
to
bed
immediately
after
mass.
"I
apologize
if
I
have
awoken
you,
Sister,"
the
abbe
said,
his
own
voice
sounding
groggy
and
on
edge.
"I
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you.
I
just
received
a
call
from
an
influential
American
bishop.
Perhaps
you
know
him?
Manuel
Aringarosa?"
"The
head
of
Opus
Dei?"
Of
course
I
know
of
him.
Who
in
the
Church
doesn't?
Aringarosa's
conservative
prelature
had
grown
powerful
in
recent
years.
Their
ascension
to
grace
was
jump
started
in
1982
when
Pope
John
Paul
II
unexpectedly
elevated
them
to
a
"personal
prelature
of
the
Pope,"
officially
sanctioning
all
of
their
practices.
Suspiciously,
Opus
Dei's
elevation
occurred
the
same
year
the
wealthy
sect
allegedly
had
transferred
almost
one
billion
dollars
into
the
Vatican's
Institute
for
Religious
Works
commonly
known
as
the
Vatican
Bank
bailing
it
out
of
an
embarrassing
bankruptcy.
In
a
second
maneuver
that
raised
eyebrows,
the
Pope
placed
the
founder
of
Opus
Dei
on
the
"fast
track"
for
sainthood,
accelerating
an
often
century
long
waiting
period
for
canonization
to
