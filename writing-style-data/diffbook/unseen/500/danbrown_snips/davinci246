small
announcement
apologizing
that
certain
areas
were
closed
for
renovations.
They
emerged
immediately
into
a
high
walled,
open
roof
courtyard
through
which
morning
rain
was
falling.
Above
them,
the
wind
howled
across
the
opening
with
a
low
drone,
like
someone
blowing
over
the
mouth
of
a
bottle.
Entering
the
narrow,
low
hanging
walkways
that
bordered
the
courtyard
perimeter,
Langdon
felt
the
familiar
uneasiness
he
always
felt
in
enclosed
spaces.
These
walkways
were
called
cloisters,
and
Langdon
noted
with
uneasiness
that
these
particular
cloisters
lived
up
to
their
Latin
ties
to
the
word
claustrophobic.
Focusing
his
mind
straight
ahead
toward
the
end
of
the
tunnel,
Langdon
followed
the
signs
for
the
that
blew
through
the
lone
pillared
wall
that
was
the
cloister's
only
source
of
light.
Another
couple
scurried
past
them
the
other
way,
hurrying
to
get
out
of
the
worsening
weather.
The
cloisters
looked
deserted
now,
admittedly
the
abbey's
least
enticing
section
in
the
wind
and
rain.
Forty
yards
down
the
east
cloister,
an
archway
materialized
on
their
left,
giving
way
to
another
hallway.
Although
this
was
the
entrance
they
were
looking
for,
the
opening
was
cordoned
off
by
a
swag
and
an
official
looking
sign.
CLOSED
FOR
RENOVATION
PYX
CHAMBER
ST.
FAITH'S
CHAPEL
The
long,
deserted
corridor
beyond
the
swag
was
littered
with
scaffolding
and
drop
cloths.
Immediately
beyond
the
swag,
Langdon
could
see
the
entrances
to
the
Pyx
Chamber
and
St.
Faith's
Chapel
on
the
right
and
left.
The
entrance
to
the
Chapter
House,
however,
was
much
farther
away,
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
hallway.
Even
from
here,
Langdon
could
see
that
its
heavy
wooden
door
was
wide
open,
and
the
spacious
octagonal
interior
was
bathed
in
a
grayish
natural
light
from
the
room's
enormous
windows
that
looked
out
on
College
Garden.
Go
through
Chapter
House,
out
south
exit,
to
public
garden.
"We
just
left
the
east
cloister,"
Langdon
said,
"so
the
south
exit
to
the
garden
must
be
through
there
and
to
the
right."
Sophie
was
already
stepping
over
the
swag
and
moving
forward.
As
they
hurried
down
the
dark
corridor,
the
sounds
of
the
wind
and
rain
from
the
open
cloister
faded
behind
them.
The
Chapter
House
was
a
kind
of
satellite
structure
a
freestanding
annex
at
the
end
of
the
long
hallway
to
ensure
the
privacy
of
the
Parliament
proceedings
housed
there.
"It
looks
huge,"
Sophie
whispered
as
they
approached.
Langdon
had
forgotten
just
how
large
this
room
was.
Even
from
outside
the
entrance,
he
could
gaze
across
the
vast
expanse
of
floor
to
the
breathtaking
windows
on
the
far
side
of
the
octagon,
which
rose
five
stories
to
a
vaulted
ceiling.
They
would
certainly
have
a
clear
view
of
the
garden
from
in
here.
Crossing
the
threshold,
both
Langdon
and
Sophie
found
themselves
having
to
squint.
After
the
gloomy
cloisters,
the
Chapter
House
felt
like
a
solarium.
They
were
a
good
ten
feet
into
the
room,
searching
the
south
wall,
when
they
realized
the
door
they
had
been
promised
was
not
there.
