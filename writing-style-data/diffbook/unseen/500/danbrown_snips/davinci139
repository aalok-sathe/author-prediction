fireside
antiques
she
was
supposed
to
sit
on
the
Renaissance
velvet
divan,
the
rustic
eagle
claw
rocker,
or
the
pair
of
stone
pews
that
looked
like
they'd
been
lifted
from
some
Byzantine
temple.
Langdon
unwrapped
the
cryptex
from
his
coat,
walked
to
the
velvet
divan,
and
slid
the
wooden
box
deep
underneath
it,
well
out
of
sight.
Then,
shaking
out
his
jacket,
he
put
it
back
on,
smoothed
the
lapels,
and
smiled
at
Sophie
as
he
sat
down
directly
over
the
stashed
treasure.
The
divan
it
is,
Sophie
thought,
taking
a
seat
beside
him.
As
she
stared
into
the
growing
fire,
enjoying
the
warmth,
Sophie
had
the
sensation
that
her
grandfather
would
have
loved
this
room.
The
dark
wood
paneling
was
bedecked
with
Old
Master
paintings,
one
of
which
Sophie
recognized
as
a
Poussin,
her
grandfather's
second
favorite
painter.
On
the
mantel
above
the
fireplace,
an
alabaster
bust
of
Isis
watched
over
the
room.
Beneath
the
Egyptian
goddess,
inside
the
fireplace,
two
stone
gargoyles
served
as
andirons,
their
mouths
gaping
to
reveal
their
menacing
hollow
throats.
Gargoyles
had
always
terrified
Sophie
as
a
child;
that
was,
until
her
grandfather
cured
her
of
the
fear
by
taking
her
atop
Notre
Dame
Cathedral
in
a
rainstorm.
"Princess,
look
at
these
silly
creatures,"
he
had
told
her,
pointing
to
the
gargoyle
rainspouts
with
their
mouths
gushing
water.
"Do
you
hear
that
funny
sound
in
their
throats?"
Sophie
nodded,
having
to
smile
at
the
burping
sound
of
the
water
gurgling
through
their
throats.
"They're
gargling,
"
her
grandfather
told
her.
"Gargariser!
And
that's
where
they
get
the
silly
name
'gargoyles.'
"
Sophie
had
never
again
been
afraid.
The
fond
memory
caused
Sophie
a
pang
of
sadness
as
the
harsh
reality
of
the
murder
gripped
her
again.
Grand
pere
is
gone.
She
pictured
the
cryptex
under
the
divan
and
wondered
if
Leigh
Teabing
would
have
any
idea
how
to
open
it.
Or
if
we
even
should
ask
him.
Sophie's
grandfather's
final
words
had
instructed
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon.
He
had
said
nothing
about
involving
anyone
else.
We
needed
somewhere
to
hide,
Sophie
said,
deciding
to
trust
Robert's
judgment.
"Sir
Robert!"
a
voice
bellowed
somewhere
behind
them.
"I
see
you
travel
with
a
maiden."
Langdon
stood
up.
Sophie
jumped
to
her
feet
as
well.
The
voice
had
come
from
the
top
of
a
curled
staircase
that
snaked
up
to
the
shadows
of
the
second
floor.
At
the
top
of
the
stairs,
a
form
moved
in
the
shadows,
only
his
silhouette
visible.
"Good
evening,"
Langdon
called
up.
"Sir
Leigh,
may
I
present
Sophie
Neveu."
"An
honor."
Teabing
moved
into
the
light.
"Thank
you
for
having
us,"
Sophie
said,
now
seeing
the
man
wore
metal
leg
braces
and
used
crutches.
He
was
coming
down
one
stair
at
a
time.
"I
realize
it's
quite
late."
"It
is
so
late,
my
dear,
it's
early."
He
laughed.
"Vous
n'etes
pas
Americaine?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Parisienne.
"Your
English
is
superb."
"Thank
you.
I
studied
at
the
Royal
Holloway."
"So
then,
