the
Church."
Langdon
often
wondered
how
many
modern
card
players
had
any
clue
that
their
four
suits
spades,
hearts,
clubs,
diamonds
were
Grail
related
symbols
that
came
directly
from
Tarot's
four
suits
of
swords,
cups,
scepters,
and
pentacles.
Spades
were
Swords
The
blade.
Male.
Hearts
were
Cups
The
chalice.
Feminine.
Clubs
were
Scepters
The
Royal
Line.
The
flowering
staff.
Diamonds
were
Pentacles
The
goddess.
The
sacred
feminine.
Four
minutes
later,
as
Langdon
began
feeling
fearful
they
would
not
find
what
they
had
come
for,
the
computer
produced
another
hit.
The
Gravity
of
Genius:
Biography
of
a
Modern
Knight.
"Gravity
of
Genius?"
Langdon
called
out
to
Gettum.
"Bio
of
a
modern
knight?"
Gettum
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner.
"How
modern?
Please
don't
tell
me
it's
your
Sir
Rudy
Giuliani.
Personally,
I
found
that
one
a
bit
off
the
mark."
Langdon
had
his
own
qualms
about
the
newly
knighted
Sir
Mick
Jagger,
but
this
hardly
seemed
the
moment
to
debate
the
politics
of
modern
British
knighthood.
"Let's
have
a
look."
Langdon
summoned
up
the
hypertext
keywords.
honorable
knight,
Sir
Isaac
Newton
in
London
in
1727
and
his
tomb
in

Abbey
Alexander

and
colleague
"I
guess
'modern'
is
a
relative
term,"
Sophie
called
to
Gettum.
"It's
an
old
book.
About
Sir
Isaac
Newton."
Gettum
shook
her
head
in
the
doorway.
"No
good.
Newton
was
buried
in
Westminster
Abbey,
the
seat
of
English
Protestantism.
There's
no
way
a
Catholic
Pope
was
present.
Cream
and
sugar?"
Sophie
nodded.
Gettum
waited.
"Robert?"
Langdon's
heart
was
hammering.
He
pulled
his
eyes
from
the
screen
and
stood
up.
"Sir
Isaac
Newton
is
our
knight."
Sophie
remained
seated.
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
"Newton
is
buried
in
London,"
Langdon
said.
"His
labors
produced
new
sciences
that
incurred
the
wrath
of
the
Church.
And
he
was
a
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion.
What
more
could
we
want?"
"What
more?"
Sophie
pointed
to
the
poem.
"How
about
a
knight
a
Pope
interred?
You
heard
Ms.
Gettum.
Newton
was
not
buried
by
a
Catholic
Pope."
Langdon
reached
for
the
mouse.
"Who
said
anything
about
a
Catholic
Pope?"
He
clicked
on
the
"Pope"
hyperlink,
and
the
complete
sentence
appeared.
Sir
Isaac
Newton's
burial,
attended
by
kings
and
nobles,
was
presided
over
by
Alexander
Pope,
friend
and
colleague,
who
gave
a
stirring
eulogy
before
sprinkling
dirt
on
the
tomb.
Langdon
looked
at
Sophie.
"We
had
the
correct
Pope
on
our
second
hit.
Alexander."
He
paused.
"A.Pope."
In
London
lies
a
knight
A.
Pope
interred.
Sophie
stood
up,
looking
stunned.
Jacques
Sauniere,
the
master
of
double
entendres,
had
proven
once
again
that
he
was
a
frighteningly
clever
man.
Silas
awoke
with
a
start.
He
had
no
idea
what
had
awoken
him
or
how
long
he
had
been
asleep.
Was
I
dreaming?
Sitting
up
now
on
his
straw
mat,
he
listened
to
the
quiet
breathing
of
the
Opus
Dei
residence
hall,
the
stillness
textured
only
by
the
soft
murmurs
of
someone
praying
aloud
in
a
room
below
him.
These
