replaced
with
oriental
carpets,
dark
oak
furniture,
and
cushioned
chairs.
On
the
broad
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
two
crystal
glasses
sat
beside
an
opened
bottle
of
Perrier,
its
bubbles
still
fizzing.
A
pewter
pot
of
coffee
steamed
beside
it.
Clockwork,
Langdon
thought.
Leave
it
to
the
Swiss.
The
man
gave
a
perceptive
smile.
"I
sense
this
is
your
first
visit
to
us?"
Sophie
hesitated
and
then
nodded.
"Understood.
Keys
are
often
passed
on
as
inheritance,
and
our
first
time
users
are
invariably
uncertain
of
the
protocol."
He
motioned
to
the
table
of
drinks.
"This
room
is
yours
as
long
as
you
care
to
use
it."
"You
say
keys
are
sometimes
inherited?"
Sophie
asked.
"Indeed.
Your
key
is
like
a
Swiss
numbered
account,
which
are
often
willed
through
generations.
On
our
gold
accounts,
the
shortest
safety
deposit
box
lease
is
fifty
years.
Paid
in
advance.
So
we
see
plenty
of
family
turnover.
Langdon
stared.
"Did
you
say
fifty
years?"
"At
a
minimum,"
their
host
replied.
"Of
course,
you
can
purchase
much
longer
leases,
but
barring
further
arrangements,
if
there
is
no
activity
on
an
account
for
fifty
years,
the
contents
of
that
safe
deposit
box
are
automatically
destroyed.
Shall
I
run
through
the
process
of
accessing
your
box?"
Sophie
nodded.
"Please."
Their
host
swept
an
arm
across
the
luxurious
salon.
"This
is
your
private
viewing
room.
Once
I
leave
the
room,
you
may
spend
all
the
time
you
need
in
here
to
review
and
modify
the
contents
of
your
safe
deposit
box,
which
arrives
over
here."
He
walked
them
to
the
far
wall
where
a
wide
conveyor
belt
entered
the
room
in
a
graceful
curve,
vaguely
resembling
a
baggage
claim
carousel.
"You
insert
your
key
in
that
slot
there."
The
man
pointed
to
a
large
electronic
podium
facing
the
conveyor
belt.
The
podium
had
a
familiar
triangular
hole.
"Once
the
computer
confirms
the
markings
on
your
key,
you
enter
your
account
number,
and
your
safe
deposit
box
will
be
retrieved
robotically
from
the
vault
below
for
your
inspection.
When
you
are
finished
with
your
box,
you
place
it
back
on
the
conveyor
belt,
insert
your
key
again,
and
the
process
is
reversed.
Because
everything
is
automated,
your
privacy
is
guaranteed,
even
from
the
staff
of
this
bank.
If
you
need
anything
at
all,
simply
press
the
call
button
on
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
room."
Sophie
was
about
to
ask
a
question
when
a
telephone
rang.
The
man
looked
puzzled
and
embarrassed.
"Excuse
me,
please."
He
walked
over
to
the
phone,
which
was
sitting
on
the
table
beside
the
coffee
and
Perrier.
"Oui?"
he
answered.
His
brow
furrowed
as
he
listened
to
the
caller.
"Oui
oui
d'
accord.
"
He
hung
up,
and
gave
them
an
uneasy
smile.
"I'm
sorry,
I
must
leave
you
now.
Make
yourselves
at
home."
He
moved
quickly
toward
the
door.
"Excuse
me,"
Sophie
called.
"Could
you
clarify
something
before
you
go?
You
mentioned
that
we
enter
an
account
number?"
The
man
