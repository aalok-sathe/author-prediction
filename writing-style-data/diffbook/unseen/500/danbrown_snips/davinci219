grow
hot
and
realized
he
had
wet
himself.
"Listen
carefully,"
the
tuxedoed
man
whispered.
"You
will
exit
this
church
silently,
and
you
will
run.
You
will
not
stop.
Is
that
clear?"
The
boy
nodded
as
best
he
could
with
the
hand
over
his
mouth.
"If
you
call
the
police"
The
tuxedoed
man
pressed
the
gun
to
his
skin.
"I
will
find
you."
The
next
thing
the
boy
knew,
he
was
sprinting
across
the
outside
courtyard
with
no
plans
of
stopping
until
his
legs
gave
out.
Like
a
ghost,
Silas
drifted
silently
behind
his
target.
Sophie
Neveu
sensed
him
too
late.
Before
she
could
turn,
Silas
pressed
the
gun
barrel
into
her
spine
and
wrapped
a
powerful
arm
across
her
chest,
pulling
her
back
against
his
hulking
body.
She
yelled
in
surprise.
Teabing
and
Langdon
both
turned
now,
their
expressions
astonished
and
fearful.
"What?"
Teabing
choked
out.
"What
did
you
do
to
Remy!"
"Your
only
concern,"
Silas
said
calmly,
"is
that
I
leave
here
with
the
keystone."
This
recovery
mission,
as
Remy
had
described
it,
was
to
be
clean
and
simple:
Enter
the
church,
take
the
keystone,
and
walk
out;
no
killing,
no
struggle.
Holding
Sophie
firm,
Silas
dropped
his
hand
from
her
chest,
down
to
her
waist,
slipping
it
inside
her
deep
sweater
pockets,
searching.
He
could
smell
the
soft
fragrance
of
her
hair
through
his
own
alcohol
laced
breath.
"Where
is
it?"
he
whispered.
The
keystone
was
in
her
sweater
pocket
earlier.
So
where
is
it
now?
"It's
over
here,"
Langdon's
deep
voice
resonated
from
across
the
room.
Silas
turned
to
see
Langdon
holding
the
black
cryptex
before
him,
waving
it
back
and
forth
like
a
matador
tempting
a
dumb
animal.
"Set
it
down,"
Silas
demanded.
"Let
Sophie
and
Leigh
leave
the
church,"
Langdon
replied.
"You
and
I
can
settle
this."
Silas
pushed
Sophie
away
from
him
and
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon,
moving
toward
him.
"Not
a
step
closer,"
Langdon
said.
"Not
until
they
leave
the
building."
"You
are
in
no
position
to
make
demands."
"I
disagree."
Langdon
raised
the
cryptex
high
over
his
head.
"I
will
not
hesitate
to
smash
this
on
the
floor
and
break
the
vial
inside."
Although
Silas
sneered
outwardly
at
the
threat,
he
felt
a
flash
of
fear.
This
was
unexpected.
He
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon's
head
and
kept
his
voice
as
steady
as
his
hand.
"You
would
never
break
the
keystone.
You
want
to
find
the
Grail
as
much
as
I
do."
You're
wrong.
You
want
it
much
more.
You've
proven
you're
willing
to
kill
for
it."
Forty
feet
away,
peering
out
from
the
annex
pews
near
the
archway,
Remy
Legaludec
felt
a
rising
alarm.
The
maneuver
had
not
gone
as
planned,
and
even
from
here,
he
could
see
Silas
was
uncertain
how
to
handle
the
situation.
At
the
Teacher's
orders,
Remy
had
forbidden
Silas
to
fire
his
gun.
"Let
them
go,"
Langdon
again
demanded,
holding
the
cryptex
high
over
his
head
and
staring
into
Silas's
gun.
