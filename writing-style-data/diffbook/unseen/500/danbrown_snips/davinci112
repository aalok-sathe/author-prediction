people
out
of
my
bank
before
the
police
arrive.
If
he
moved
quickly,
this
impending
disaster
could
be
deftly
sidestepped.
Vernet
could
tell
the
police
that
the
fugitives
in
question
had
indeed
walked
into
his
bank
as
reported,
but
because
they
were
not
clients
and
had
no
account
number,
they
were
turned
away.
He
wished
the
damned
watchman
had
not
called
Interpol.
Discretion
was
apparently
not
part
of
the
vocabulary
of
a
15
euro
per
hour
watchman.
Stopping
at
the
doorway,
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
loosened
his
muscles.
Then,
forcing
a
balmy
smile,
he
unlocked
the
door
and
swirled
into
the
room
like
a
warm
breeze.
"Good
evening,"
he
said,
his
eyes
finding
his
clients.
"I
am
Andre
Vernet.
How
can
I
be
of
serv
The
rest
of
the
sentence
lodged
somewhere
beneath
his
Adam's
apple.
The
woman
before
him
was
as
unexpected
a
visitor
as
Vernet
had
ever
had.
"I'm
sorry,
do
we
know
each
other?"
Sophie
asked.
She
did
not
recognize
the
banker,
but
he
for
a
moment
looked
as
if
he'd
seen
a
ghost.
"No,"
the
bank
president
fumbled.
"I
don't
believe
so.
Our
services
are
anonymous."
He
exhaled
and
forced
a
calm
smile.
"My
assistant
tells
me
you
have
a
gold
key
but
no
account
number?
Might
I
ask
how
you
came
by
this
key?"
"My
grandfather
gave
it
to
me,"
Sophie
replied,
watching
the
man
closely.
His
uneasiness
seemed
more
evident
now.
"Really?
Your
grandfather
gave
you
the
key
but
failed
to
give
you
the
account
number?"
"I
don't
think
he
had
time,"
Sophie
said.
"He
was
murdered
tonight."
Her
words
sent
the
man
staggering
backward.
"Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead?"
he
demanded,
his
eyes
filling
with
horror.
"But
how?!"
Now
it
was
Sophie
who
reeled,
numb
with
shock.
"You
knew
my
grandfather?"
Banker
Andre
Vernet
looked
equally
astounded,
steadying
himself
by
leaning
on
an
end
table.
"Jacques
and
I
were
dear
friends.
When
did
this
happen?"
"Earlier
this
evening.
Inside
the
Louvre."
Vernet
walked
to
a
deep
leather
chair
and
sank
into
it.
"I
need
to
ask
you
both
a
very
important
question."
He
glanced
up
at
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Sophie.
"Did
either
of
you
have
anything
to
do
with
his
death?"
"No!"
Sophie
declared.
"Absolutely
not."
Vernet's
face
was
grim,
and
he
paused,
pondering.
"Your
pictures
are
being
circulated
by
Interpol.
This
is
how
I
recognized
you.
You're
wanted
for
a
murder."
Sophie
slumped.
Fache
ran
an
Interpol
broadcast
already?
It
seemed
the
captain
was
more
motivated
than
Sophie
had
anticipated.
She
quickly
told
Vernet
who
Langdon
was
and
what
had
happened
inside
the
Louvre
tonight.
Vernet
looked
amazed.
"And
as
your
grandfather
was
dying,
he
left
you
a
message
telling
you
to
find
Mr.
Langdon?"
"Yes.
And
this
key."
Sophie
laid
the
gold
key
on
the
coffee
table
in
front
of
Vernet,
placing
the
Priory
seal
face
down.
Vernet
glanced
at
the
key
but
made
no
move
to
touch
it.
"He
left
you
only
this
key?
Nothing
else?
No
