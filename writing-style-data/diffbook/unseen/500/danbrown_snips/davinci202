toward
the
cockpit.
"What
are
you
doing?"
Langdon
asked.
"Sales
meeting,"
Teabing
said,
wondering
how
much
it
would
cost
him
to
persuade
his
pilot
to
perform
one
highly
irregular
maneuver.
The
Hawker
is
on
final
approach.
Simon
Edwards
Executive
Services
Officer
at
Biggin
Hill
Airport
paced
the
control
tower,
squinting
nervously
at
the
rain
drenched
runway.
He
never
appreciated
being
awoken
early
on
a
Saturday
morning,
but
it
was
particularly
distasteful
that
he
had
been
called
in
to
oversee
the
arrest
of
one
of
his
most
lucrative
clients.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
paid
Biggin
Hill
not
only
for
a
private
hangar
but
a
"per
landing
fee"
for
his
frequent
arrivals
and
departures.
Usually,
the
airfield
had
advance
warning
of
his
schedule
and
was
able
to
follow
a
strict
protocol
for
his
arrival.
Teabing
liked
things
just
so.
The
custom
built
Jaguar
stretch
limousine
that
he
kept
in
his
hangar
was
to
be
fully
gassed,
polished,
and
the
day's
London
Times
laid
out
on
the
back
seat.
A
customs
official
was
to
be
waiting
for
the
plane
at
the
hangar
to
expedite
the
mandatory
documentation
and
luggage
check.
Occasionally,
customs
agents
accepted
large
tips
from
Teabing
in
exchange
for
turning
a
blind
eye
to
the
transport
of
harmless
organics
mostly
luxury
foods
French
escargots,
a
particularly
ripe
unprocessed
Roquefort,
certain
fruits.
Many
customs
laws
were
absurd,
anyway,
and
if
Biggin
Hill
didn't
accommodate
its
clients,
certainly
competing
airfields
would.
Teabing
was
provided
with
what
he
wanted
here
at
Biggin
Hill,
and
the
employees
reaped
the
benefits.
Edwards's
nerves
felt
frayed
now
as
he
watched
the
jet
coming
in.
He
wondered
if
Teabing's
penchant
for
spreading
the
wealth
had
gotten
him
in
trouble
somehow;
the
French
authorities
seemed
very
intent
on
containing
him.
Edwards
had
not
yet
been
told
what
the
charges
were,
but
they
were
obviously
serious.
At
the
French
authorities'
request,
Kent
police
had
ordered
the
Biggin
Hill
air
traffic
controller
to
radio
the
Hawker's
pilot
and
order
him
directly
to
the
terminal
rather
than
to
the
client's
hangar.
The
pilot
had
agreed,
apparently
believing
the
far
fetched
story
of
a
gas
leak.
Though
the
British
police
did
not
generally
carry
weapons,
the
gravity
of
the
situation
had
brought
out
an
armed
response
team.
Now,
eight
policemen
with
handguns
stood
just
inside
the
terminal
building,
awaiting
the
moment
when
the
plane's
engines
powered
down.
The
instant
this
happened,
a
runway
attendant
would
place
safety
wedges
under
the
tires
so
the
plane
could
no
longer
move.
Then
the
police
would
step
into
view
and
hold
the
occupants
at
bay
until
the
French
police
arrived
to
handle
the
situation.
The
Hawker
was
low
in
the
sky
now,
skimming
the
treetops
to
their
right.
Simon
Edwards
went
downstairs
to
watch
the
landing
from
tarmac
level.
The
Kent
police
were
poised,
just
out
of
sight,
and
the
maintenance
man
waited
with
his
wedges.
Out
on
the
runway,
the
Hawker's
nose
tipped
up,
and
the
tires
touched
down
in
a
puff
of
smoke.
The
plane
settled
