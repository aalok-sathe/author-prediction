corporal
mortification
he
had
endured
earlier
today,
and
yet
the
pain
was
inconsequential
compared
with
the
anguish
of
his
life
before
Opus
Dei
had
saved
him.
Still,
the
memories
haunted
his
soul.
Release
your
hatred,
Silas
commanded
himself.
Forgive
those
who
trespassed
against
you.
Looking
up
at
the
stone
towers
of
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
fought
that
familiar
undertow
that
force
that
often
dragged
his
mind
back
in
time,
locking
him
once
again
in
the
prison
that
had
been
his
world
as
a
young
man.
The
memories
of
purgatory
came
as
they
always
did,
like
a
tempest
to
his
senses
the
reek
of
rotting
cabbage,
the
stench
of
death,
human
urine
and
feces.
The
cries
of
hopelessness
against
the
howling
wind
of
the
Pyrenees
and
the
soft
sobs
of
forgotten
men.
Andorra,
he
thought,
feeling
his
muscles
tighten.
Incredibly,
it
was
in
that
barren
and
forsaken
suzerain
between
Spain
and
France,
shivering
in
his
stone
cell,
wanting
only
to
die,
that
Silas
had
been
saved.
He
had
not
realized
it
at
the
time.
The
light
came
long
after
the
thunder.
His
name
was
not
Silas
then,
although
he
didn't
recall
the
name
his
parents
had
given
him.
He
had
left
home
when
he
was
seven.
His
drunken
father,
a
burly
dockworker,
enraged
by
the
arrival
of
an
albino
son,
beat
his
mother
regularly,
blaming
her
for
the
boy's
embarrassing
condition.
When
the
boy
tried
to
defend
her,
he
too
was
badly
beaten.
One
night,
there
was
a
horrific
fight,
and
his
mother
never
got
up.
The
boy
stood
over
his
lifeless
mother
and
felt
an
unbearable
up
welling
of
guilt
for
permitting
it
to
happen.
This
is
my
fault!
As
if
some
kind
of
demon
were
controlling
his
body,
the
boy
walked
to
the
kitchen
and
grasped
a
butcher
knife.
Hypnotically,
he
moved
to
the
bedroom
where
his
father
lay
on
the
bed
in
a
drunken
stupor.
Without
a
word,
the
boy
stabbed
him
in
the
back.
His
father
cried
out
in
pain
and
tried
to
roll
over,
but
his
son
stabbed
him
again,
over
and
over
until
the
apartment
fell
quiet.
The
boy
fled
home
but
found
the
streets
of
Marseilles
equally
unfriendly.
His
strange
appearance
made
him
an
outcast
among
the
other
young
runaways,
and
he
was
forced
to
live
alone
in
the
basement
of
a
dilapidated
factory,
eating
stolen
fruit
and
raw
fish
from
the
dock.
His
only
companions
were
tattered
magazines
he
found
in
the
trash,
and
he
taught
himself
to
read
them.
Over
time,
he
grew
strong.
When
he
was
twelve,
another
drifter
a
girl
twice
his
age
mocked
him
on
the
streets
and
attempted
to
steal
his
food.
The
girl
found
herself
pummeled
to
within
inches
of
her
life.
When
the
authorities
pulled
the
boy
off
her,
they
gave
him
an
ultimatum
leave
Marseilles
or
go
to
juvenile
prison.
The
boy
moved
down
the
coast
to
Toulon.
Over
time,
the
looks
of
pity
on
the
streets
turned
to
looks
of
fear.
The
boy
had
grown
