Magdalene's
long
red
hair
and
quiet
eyes.
There
was
something
in
the
woman's
expression
that
echoed
the
loss
of
a
loved
one.
Sophie
could
feel
it
too.
"Robert?"
she
said
softly.
He
stepped
closer.
"I
know
Leigh
said
the
Grail
story
is
all
around
us,
but
tonight
is
the
first
time
I've
ever
heard
any
of
this."
Langdon
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
put
a
comforting
hand
on
her
shoulder,
but
he
refrained.
"You've
heard
her
story
before,
Sophie.
Everyone
has.
We
just
don't
realize
it
when
we
hear
it."
"I
don't
understand."
"The
Grail
story
is
everywhere,
but
it
is
hidden.
When
the
Church
outlawed
speaking
of
the
shunned
Mary
Magdalene,
her
story
and
importance
had
to
be
passed
on
through
more
discreet
channels
channels
that
supported
metaphor
and
symbolism."
"Of
course.
The
arts."
Langdon
motioned
to
The
Last
Supper.
"A
perfect
example.
Some
of
today's
most
enduring
art,
literature,
and
music
secretly
tell
the
history
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus."
Langdon
quickly
told
her
about
works
by
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Poussin,
Bernini,
Mozart,
and
Victor
Hugo
that
all
whispered
of
the
quest
to
restore
the
banished
sacred
feminine.
Enduring
legends
like
Sir
Gawain
and
the
Green
Knight,
King
Arthur,
and
Sleeping
Beauty
were
Grail
allegories.
Victor
Hugo's
Hunchback
of
Notre
Dame
and
Mozart's
Magic
Flute
were
filled
with
Masonic
symbolism
and
Grail
secrets.
"Once
you
open
your
eyes
to
the
Holy
Grail,"
Langdon
said,
"you
see
her
everywhere.
Paintings.
Music.
Books.
Even
in
cartoons,
theme
parks,
and
popular
movies."
Langdon
held
up
his
Mickey
Mouse
watch
and
told
her
that
Walt
Disney
had
made
it
his
quiet
life's
work
to
pass
on
the
Grail
story
to
future
generations.
Throughout
his
entire
life,
Disney
had
been
hailed
as
"the
Modern
Day
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Both
men
were
generations
ahead
of
their
times,
uniquely
gifted
artists,
members
of
secret
societies,
and,
most
notably,
avid
pranksters.
Like
Leonardo,
Walt
Disney
loved
infusing
hidden
messages
and
symbolism
in
his
art.
For
the
trained
symbologist,
watching
an
early
Disney
movie
was
like
being
barraged
by
an
avalanche
of
allusion
and
metaphor.
Most
of
Disney's
hidden
messages
dealt
with
religion,
pagan
myth,
and
stories
of
the
subjugated
goddess.
It
was
no
mistake
that
Disney
retold
tales
like
Cinderella,
Sleeping
Beauty,
and
Snow
White
all
of
which
dealt
with
the
incarceration
of
the
sacred
feminine.
Nor
did
one
need
a
background
in
symbolism
to
understand
that
Snow
White
a
princess
who
fell
from
grace
after
partaking
of
a
poisoned
apple
was
a
clear
allusion
to
the
downfall
of
Eve
in
the
Garden
of
Eden.
Or
that
Sleeping
Beauty's
Princess
Aurora
code
named
"Rose"
and
hidden
deep
in
the
forest
to
protect
her
from
the
clutches
of
the
evil
witch
was
the
Grail
story
for
children.
Despite
its
corporate
image,
Disney
still
had
a
savvy,
playful
element
among
its
employees,
and
their
artists
still
amused
themselves
by
inserting
hidden
symbolism
in
Disney
products.
Langdon
would
never
forget
one
of
his
students
bringing
in
a
DVD
