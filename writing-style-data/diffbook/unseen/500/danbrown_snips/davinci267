you
remember
earlier
that
I
mentioned
Rosslyn
itself
is
a
copy
of
Solomon's
Temple?
Those
two
pillars
are
exact
replicas
of
the
two
pillars
that
stood
at
the
head
of
Solomon's
Temple."
Langdon
pointed
to
the
pillar
on
the
left.
"That's
called
Boaz
or
the
Mason's
Pillar.
The
other
is
called
Jachin
or
the
Apprentice
Pillar."
He
paused.
"In
fact,
virtually
every
Masonic
temple
in
the
world
has
two
pillars
like
these."
Langdon
had
already
explained
to
her
about
the
Templars'
powerful
historic
ties
to
the
modern
Masonic
secret
societies,
whose
primary
degrees
Apprentice
Freemason,
Fellowcraft
Freemason,
and
Master
Mason
harked
back
to
early
Templar
days.
Sophie's
grandfather's
final
verse
made
direct
reference
to
the
Master
Masons
who
adorned
Rosslyn
with
their
carved
artistic
offerings.
It
also
noted
Rosslyn's
central
ceiling,
which
was
covered
with
carvings
of
stars
and
planets.
"I've
never
been
in
a
Masonic
temple,"
Sophie
said,
still
eyeing
the
pillars.
"I
am
almost
positive
I
saw
these
here.
"
She
turned
back
into
the
chapel,
as
if
looking
for
something
else
to
jog
her
memory.
The
rest
of
the
visitors
were
now
leaving,
and
the
young
docent
made
his
way
across
the
chapel
to
them
with
a
pleasant
smile.
He
was
a
handsome
young
man
in
his
late
twenties,
with
a
Scottish
brogue
and
strawberry
blond
hair.
"I'm
about
to
close
up
for
the
day.
May
I
help
you
find
anything?"
How
about
the
Holy
Grail?
Langdon
wanted
to
say.
"The
code,"
Sophie
blurted,
in
sudden
revelation.
"There's
a
code
here!"
The
docent
looked
pleased
by
her
enthusiasm.
"Yes
there
is,
ma'am."
"It's
on
the
ceiling,"
she
said,
turning
to
the
right
hand
wall.
"Somewhere
over
there."
He
smiled.
"Not
your
first
visit
to
Rosslyn,
I
see."
The
code,
Langdon
thought.
He
had
forgotten
that
little
bit
of
lore.
Among
Rosslyn's
numerous
mysteries
was
a
vaulted
archway
from
which
hundreds
of
stone
blocks
protruded,
jutting
down
to
form
a
bizarre
multifaceted
surface.
Each
block
was
carved
with
a
symbol,
seemingly
at
random,
creating
a
cipher
of
unfathomable
proportion.
Some
people
believed
the
code
revealed
the
entrance
to
the
vault
beneath
the
chapel.
Others
believed
it
told
the
true
Grail
legend.
Not
that
it
mattered
cryptographers
had
been
trying
for
centuries
to
decipher
its
meaning.
To
this
day
the
Rosslyn
Trust
offered
a
generous
reward
to
anyone
who
could
unveil
the
secret
meaning,
but
the
code
remained
a
mystery.
"I'd
be
happy
to
show"
The
docent's
voice
trailed
off.
My
first
code,
Sophie
thought,
moving
alone,
in
a
trance,
toward
the
encoded
archway.
Having
handed
the
rosewood
box
to
Langdon,
she
could
feel
herself
momentarily
forgetting
all
about
the
Holy
Grail,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
and
all
the
mysteries
of
the
past
day.
When
she
arrived
beneath
the
encoded
ceiling
and
saw
the
symbols
above
her,
the
memories
came
flooding
back.
She
was
recalling
her
first
visit
here,
and
strangely,
the
memories
conjured
an
unexpected
sadness.
She
was
a
little
girl
a
year
or
so
after
her
family's
