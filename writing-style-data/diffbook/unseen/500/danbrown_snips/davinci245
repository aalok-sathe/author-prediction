to
her,
she
was
staring
aghast
at
the
top
of
the
black
marble
sarcophagus.
"Someone
was
here,"
she
whispered,
pointing
to
a
spot
on
the
sarcophagus
near
Newton's
outstretched
right
foot.
Langdon
did
not
understand
her
concern.
A
careless
tourist
had
left
a
charcoal,
grave
rubbing
pencil
on
the
sarcophagus
lid
near
Newton's
foot.
It's
nothing.
Langdon
reached
out
to
pick
it
up,
but
as
he
leaned
toward
the
sarcophagus,
the
light
shifted
on
the
polished
black
marble
slab,
and
Langdon
froze.
Suddenly,
he
saw
why
Sophie
was
afraid.
Scrawled
on
the
sarcophagus
lid,
at
Newton's
feet,
shimmered
a
barely
visible
charcoal
pencil
message:
I
have
Teabing.
Go
through
Chapter
House,
out
south
exit,
to
public
garden.
Langdon
read
the
words
twice,
his
heart
pounding
wildly.
Sophie
turned
and
scanned
the
nave.
Despite
the
pall
of
trepidation
that
settled
over
him
upon
seeing
the
words,
Langdon
told
himself
this
was
good
news.
Leigh
is
still
alive.
There
was
another
implication
here
too.
"They
don't
know
the
password
either,"
he
whispered.
Sophie
nodded.
Otherwise
why
make
their
presence
known?
"They
may
want
to
trade
Leigh
for
the
password."
"Or
it's
a
trap."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"I
don't
think
so.
The
garden
is
outside
the
abbey
walls.
A
very
public
place."
Langdon
had
once
visited
the
abbey's
famous
College
Garden
a
small
fruit
orchard
and
herb
garden
left
over
from
the
days
when
monks
grew
natural
pharmacological
remedies
here.
Boasting
the
oldest
living
fruit
trees
in
Great
Britain,
College
Garden
was
a
popular
spot
for
tourists
to
visit
without
having
to
enter
the
abbey.
"I
think
sending
us
outside
is
a
show
of
faith.
So
we
feel
safe."
Sophie
looked
dubious.
"You
mean
outside,
where
there
are
no
metal
detectors?"
Langdon
scowled.
She
had
a
point.
Gazing
back
at
the
orb
filled
tomb,
Langdon
wished
he
had
some
idea
about
the
cryptex
password
something
with
which
to
negotiate.
got
Leigh
involved
in
this,
and
I'll
do
whatever
it
takes
if
there
is
a
chance
to
help
him.
"The
note
says
to
go
through
the
Chapter
House
to
the
south
exit,"
Sophie
said.
"Maybe
from
the
exit
we
would
have
a
view
of
the
garden?
That
way
we
could
assess
the
situation
before
we
walked
out
there
and
exposed
ourselves
to
any
danger?"
The
idea
was
a
good
one.
Langdon
vaguely
recalled
the
Chapter
House
as
a
huge
octagonal
hall
where
the
original
British
Parliament
convened
in
the
days
before
the
modern
Parliament
building
existed.
It
had
been
years
since
he
had
been
there,
but
he
remembered
it
being
out
through
the
cloister
somewhere.
Taking
several
steps
back
from
the
tomb,
Langdon
peered
around
the
choir
screen
to
his
right,
across
the
nave
to
the
side
opposite
that
which
they
had
descended.
A
gaping
vaulted
passageway
stood
nearby,
with
a
large
sign.
THIS
WAY
TO:
CLOISTERS
DEANERY
COLLEGE
HALL
MUSEUM
PYX
CHAMBER
ST.
FAITH'S
CHAPEL
Langdon
and
Sophie
were
jogging
as
they
passed
beneath
the
sign,
moving
too
quickly
to
notice
the
