Lisa!
The
Mona
Lisa.
For
an
instant,
standing
in
the
exit
stairwell,
Sophie
forgot
all
about
trying
to
leave
the
Louvre.
Her
shock
over
the
anagram
was
matched
only
by
her
embarrassment
at
not
having
deciphered
the
message
herself.
Sophie's
expertise
in
complex
cryptanalysis
had
caused
her
to
overlook
simplistic
word
games,
and
yet
she
knew
she
should
have
seen
it.
After
all,
she
was
no
stranger
to
anagrams
especially
in
English.
When
she
was
young,
often
her
grandfather
would
use
anagram
games
to
hone
her
English
spelling.
Once
he
had
written
the
English
word
"planets"
and
told
Sophie
that
an
astonishing
sixty
two
other
English
words
of
varying
lengths
could
be
formed
using
those
same
letters.
Sophie
had
spent
three
days
with
an
English
dictionary
until
she
found
them
all.
"I
can't
imagine,"
Langdon
said,
staring
at
the
printout,
"how
your
grandfather
created
such
an
intricate
anagram
in
the
minutes
before
he
died."
Sophie
knew
the
explanation,
and
the
realization
made
her
feel
even
worse.
should
have
seen
this!
She
now
recalled
that
her
grandfather
a
wordplay
aficionado
and
art
lover
had
entertained
himself
as
a
young
man
by
creating
anagrams
of
famous
works
of
art.
In
fact,
one
of
his
anagrams
had
gotten
him
in
trouble
once
when
Sophie
was
a
little
girl.
While
being
interviewed
by
an
American
art
magazine,
Sauniere
had
expressed
his
distaste
for
the
modernist
Cubist
movement
by
noting
that
Picasso's
masterpiece
Les
Demoiselles
d
'Avignon
was
a
perfect
anagram
of
vile
meaningless
doodles.
Picasso
fans
were
not
amused.
"My
grandfather
probably
created
this
Mona
Lisa
anagram
long
ago,"
Sophie
said,
glancing
up
at
Langdon.
And
tonight
he
was
forced
to
use
it
as
a
makeshift
code.
Her
grandfather's
voice
had
called
out
from
beyond
with
chilling
precision.
Leonardo
da
Vinci!
The
Mona
Lisa!
Why
his
final
words
to
her
referenced
the
famous
painting,
Sophie
had
no
idea,
but
she
could
think
of
only
one
possibility.
A
disturbing
one.
Those
were
not
his
final
words.
Was
she
supposed
to
visit
the
Mona
Lisa?
Had
her
grandfather
left
her
a
message
there?
The
idea
seemed
perfectly
plausible.
After
all,
the
famous
painting
hung
in
the
Salle
des
Etats
a
private
viewing
chamber
accessible
only
from
the
Grand
Gallery.
In
fact,
Sophie
now
realized,
the
doors
that
opened
into
the
chamber
were
situated
only
twenty
meters
from
where
her
grandfather
had
been
found
dead.
He
easily
could
have
visited
the
Mona
Lisa
before
he
died.
Sophie
gazed
back
up
the
emergency
stairwell
and
felt
torn.
She
knew
she
should
usher
Langdon
from
the
museum
immediately,
and
yet
instinct
urged
her
to
the
contrary.
As
Sophie
recalled
her
first
childhood
visit
to
the
Denon
Wing,
she
realized
that
if
her
grandfather
had
a
secret
to
tell
her,
few
places
on
earth
made
a
more
apt
rendezvous
than
Da
Vinci's
Mona
Lisa.
"She's
just
a
little
bit
farther,"
her
grandfather
had
whispered,
clutching
Sophie's
tiny
hand
as
he
led
her
through
the
deserted
museum
after
hours.
Sophie
was
