days,
his
trust
in
God
and
The
Way
never
wavered.
It
was
only
a
month
later
that
the
clouds
parted
miraculously
and
the
light
of
possibility
shone
through.
Divine
intervention,
Aringarosa
had
called
it.
The
bishop
had
seemed
hopeful
for
the
first
time.
"Silas,"
he
whispered,
"God
has
bestowed
upon
us
an
opportunity
to
protect
The
Way.
Our
battle,
like
all
battles,
will
take
sacrifice.
Will
you
be
a
soldier
of
God?"
Silas
fell
to
his
knees
before
Bishop
Aringarosa
the
man
who
had
given
him
a
new
life
and
he
said,
"I
am
a
lamb
of
God.
Shepherd
me
as
your
heart
commands."
When
Aringarosa
described
the
opportunity
that
had
presented
itself,
Silas
knew
it
could
only
be
the
hand
of
God
at
work.
Miraculous
fate!
Aringarosa
put
Silas
in
contact
with
the
man
who
had
proposed
the
plan
a
man
who
called
himself
the
Teacher.
Although
the
Teacher
and
Silas
never
met
face
to
face,
each
time
they
spoke
by
phone,
Silas
was
awed,
both
by
the
profundity
of
the
Teacher's
faith
and
by
the
scope
of
his
power.
The
Teacher
seemed
to
be
a
man
who
knew
all,
a
man
with
eyes
and
ears
in
all
places.
How
the
Teacher
gathered
his
information,
Silas
did
not
know,
but
Aringarosa
had
placed
enormous
trust
in
the
Teacher,
and
he
had
told
Silas
to
do
the
same.
"Do
as
the
Teacher
commands
you,"
the
bishop
told
Silas.
"And
we
will
be
victorious."
Victorious.
Silas
now
gazed
at
the
bare
floor
and
feared
victory
had
eluded
them.
The
Teacher
had
been
tricked.
The
keystone
was
a
devious
dead
end.
And
with
the
deception,
all
hope
had
vanished.
Silas
wished
he
could
call
Bishop
Aringarosa
and
warn
him,
but
the
Teacher
had
removed
all
their
lines
of
direct
communication
tonight.
For
our
safety.
Finally,
overcoming
enormous
trepidation,
Silas
crawled
to
his
feet
and
found
his
robe,
which
lay
on
the
floor.
He
dug
his
cell
phone
from
the
pocket.
Hanging
his
head
in
shame,
he
dialed.
"Teacher,"
he
whispered,
"all
is
lost."
Silas
truthfully
told
the
man
how
he
had
been
tricked.
"You
lose
your
faith
too
quickly,"
the
Teacher
replied.
"I
have
just
received
news.
Most
unexpected
and
welcome.
The
secret
lives.
Jacques
Sauniere
transferred
information
before
he
died.
I
will
call
you
soon.
Our
work
tonight
is
not
yet
done."
Riding
inside
the
dimly
lit
cargo
hold
of
the
armored
truck
was
like
being
transported
inside
a
cell
for
solitary
confinement.
Langdon
fought
the
all
too
familiar
anxiety
that
haunted
him
in
confined
spaces.
Vernet
said
he
would
take
us
a
safe
distance
out
of
the
city.
Where?
How
far?
Langdon's
legs
had
gotten
stiff
from
sitting
cross
legged
on
the
metal
floor,
and
he
shifted
his
position,
wincing
to
feel
the
blood
pouring
back
into
his
lower
body.
In
his
arms,
he
still
clutched
the
bizarre
treasure
they
had
extricated
from
the
bank.
"I
think
we're
on
the
highway
now,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
sensed
the
same
thing.
The
