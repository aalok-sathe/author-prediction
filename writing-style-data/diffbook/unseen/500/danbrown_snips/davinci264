thoughts
obviously
far
away.
When
he
turned,
there
was
an
uncertainty
about
him.
"My
Lord,
where
do
you
go
from
here?"
Aringarosa
had
been
asked
the
exact
same
question
as
he
left
Castel
Gandolfo
the
night
before.
"I
suspect
my
path
is
as
uncertain
as
yours."
"Yes."
Fache
paused.
"I
suspect
I
will
be
retiring
early."
Aringarosa
smiled.
"A
little
faith
can
do
wonders,
Captain.
A
little
faith.
Rosslyn
Chapel
often
called
the
Cathedral
of
Codes
stands
seven
miles
south
of
Edinburgh,
Scotland,
on
the
site
of
an
ancient
Mithraic
temple.
Built
by
the
Knights
Templar
in
1446,
the
chapel
is
engraved
with
a
mind
boggling
array
of
symbols
from
the
Jewish,
Christian,
Egyptian,
Masonic,
and
pagan
traditions.
The
chapel's
geographic
coordinates
fall
precisely
on
the
north
south
meridian
that
runs
through
Glastonbury.
This
longitudinal
Rose
Line
is
the
traditional
marker
of
King
Arthur's
Isle
of
Avalon
and
is
considered
the
central
pillar
of
Britain's
sacred
geometry.
It
is
from
this
hallowed
Rose
Line
that
Rosslyn
originally
spelled
Roslin
takes
its
name.
Rosslyn's
rugged
spires
were
casting
long
evening
shadows
as
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu
pulled
their
rental
car
into
the
grassy
parking
area
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
on
which
the
chapel
stood.
Their
short
flight
from
London
to
Edinburgh
had
been
restful,
although
neither
of
them
had
slept
for
the
anticipation
of
what
lay
ahead.
Gazing
up
at
the
stark
edifice
framed
against
a
cloud
swept
sky,
Langdon
felt
like
Alice
falling
headlong
into
the
rabbit
hole.
This
must
be
a
dream.
And
yet
he
knew
the
text
of
Sauniere's
final
message
could
not
have
been
more
specific.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
Langdon
had
fantasized
that
Sauniere's
"Grail
map"
would
be
a
diagram
a
drawing
with
an
X
marks
the
spot
and
yet
the
Priory's
final
secret
had
been
unveiled
in
the
same
way
Sauniere
had
spoken
to
them
from
the
beginning.
Simple
verse.
Four
explicit
lines
that
pointed
without
a
doubt
to
this
very
spot.
In
addition
to
identifying
Rosslyn
by
name,
the
verse
made
reference
to
several
of
the
chapel's
renowned
architectural
features.
Despite
the
clarity
of
Sauniere's
final
revelation,
Langdon
had
been
left
feeling
more
off
balance
than
enlightened.
To
him,
Rosslyn
Chapel
seemed
far
too
obvious
a
location.
For
centuries,
this
stone
chapel
had
echoed
with
whispers
of
the
Holy
Grail's
presence.
The
whispers
had
turned
to
shouts
in
recent
decades
when
ground
penetrating
radar
revealed
the
presence
of
an
astonishing
structure
beneath
the
chapel
a
massive
subterranean
chamber.
Not
only
did
this
deep
vault
dwarf
the
chapel
atop
it,
but
it
appeared
to
have
no
entrance
or
exit.
Archaeologists
petitioned
to
begin
blasting
through
the
bedrock
to
reach
the
mysterious
chamber,
but
the
Rosslyn
Trust
expressly
forbade
any
excavation
of
the
sacred
site.
Of
course,
this
only
fueled
the
fires
of
speculation.
What
was
the
Rosslyn
Trust
trying
to
hide?
Rosslyn
had
now
become
a
pilgrimage
site
for
mystery
seekers.
Some
claimed
they
were
drawn
here
by
