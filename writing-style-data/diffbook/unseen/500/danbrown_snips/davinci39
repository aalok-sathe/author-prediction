toweled
off,
the
rest
room's
door
creaked
open
behind
him.
He
spun.
Sophie
Neveu
entered,
her
green
eyes
flashing
fear.
"Thank
God
you
came.
We
don't
have
much
time."
Langdon
stood
beside
the
sinks,
staring
in
bewilderment
at
DCPJ
cryptographer
Sophie
Neveu.
Only
minutes
ago,
Langdon
had
listened
to
her
phone
message,
thinking
the
newly
arrived
cryptographer
must
be
insane.
And
yet,
the
more
he
listened,
the
more
he
sensed
Sophie
Neveu
was
speaking
in
earnest.
Do
not
react
to
this
message.
Just
listen
calmly.
You
are
in
danger
right
now.
Follow
my
directions
very
closely.
Filled
with
uncertainty,
Langdon
had
decided
to
do
exactly
as
Sophie
advised.
He
told
Fache
that
the
phone
message
was
regarding
an
injured
friend
back
home.
Then
he
had
asked
to
use
the
rest
room
at
the
end
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
Sophie
stood
before
him
now,
still
catching
her
breath
after
doubling
back
to
the
rest
room.
In
the
fluorescent
lights,
Langdon
was
surprised
to
see
that
her
strong
air
actually
radiated
from
unexpectedly
soft
features.
Only
her
gaze
was
sharp,
and
the
juxtaposition
conjured
images
of
a
multilayered
Renoir
portrait
veiled
but
distinct,
with
a
boldness
that
somehow
retained
its
shroud
of
mystery.
"I
wanted
to
warn
you,
Mr.
Langdon"
Sophie
began,
still
catching
her
breath,
"that
you
are
sous
surveillance
cachee.
Under
a
guarded
observation."
As
she
spoke,
her
accented
English
resonated
off
the
tile
walls,
giving
her
voice
a
hollow
quality.
"But
why?"
Langdon
demanded.
Sophie
had
already
given
him
an
explanation
on
the
phone,
but
he
wanted
to
hear
it
from
her
lips.
"Because,"
she
said,
stepping
toward
him,
"Fache's
primary
suspect
in
this
murder
is
you.
Langdon
was
braced
for
the
words,
and
yet
they
still
sounded
utterly
ridiculous.
According
to
Sophie,
Langdon
had
been
called
to
the
Louvre
tonight
not
as
a
symbologist
but
rather
as
a
suspect
and
was
currently
the
unwitting
target
of
one
of
DCPJ's
favorite
interrogation
methods
surveillance
cachee
a
deft
deception
in
which
the
police
calmly
invited
a
suspect
to
a
crime
scene
and
interviewed
him
in
hopes
he
would
get
nervous
and
mistakenly
incriminate
himself.
"Look
in
your
jacket's
left
pocket,"
Sophie
said.
"You'll
find
proof
they
are
watching
you."
Langdon
felt
his
apprehension
rising.
Look
in
my
pocket?
It
sounded
like
some
kind
of
cheap
magic
trick.
"Just
look."
Bewildered,
Langdon
reached
his
hand
into
his
tweed
jacket's
left
pocket
one
he
never
used.
Feeling
around
inside,
he
found
nothing.
What
the
devil
did
you
expect?
He
began
wondering
if
Sophie
might
just
be
insane
after
all.
Then
his
fingers
brushed
something
unexpected.
Small
and
hard.
Pinching
the
tiny
object
between
his
fingers,
Langdon
pulled
it
out
and
stared
in
astonishment.
It
was
a
metallic,
button
shaped
disk,
about
the
size
of
a
watch
battery.
He
had
never
seen
it
before.
"What
the?"
"GPS
tracking
dot,"
Sophie
said.
"Continuously
transmits
its
location
to
a
Global
Positioning
System
satellite
that
DCPJ
can
monitor.
We
use
them
to
monitor
people's
locations.
It's
