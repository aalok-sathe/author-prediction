one
in
constant
conflict
with
the
Church."
As
Langdon
said
this,
an
odd
thought
popped
into
his
mind.
He
glanced
down
at
the
message
on
the
floor
again.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
"Yes?"
Fache
said.
Langdon
weighed
his
words
carefully.
"I
was
just
thinking
that
Sauniere
shared
a
lot
of
spiritual
ideologies
with
Da
Vinci,
including
a
concern
over
the
Church's
elimination
of
the
sacred
feminine
from
modern
religion.
Maybe,
by
imitating
a
famous
Da
Vinci
drawing,
Sauniere
was
simply
echoing
some
of
their
shared
frustrations
with
the
modern
Church's
demonization
of
the
goddess."
Fache's
eyes
hardened.
"You
think
Sauniere
is
calling
the
Church
a
lame
saint
and
a
Draconian
devil?"
Langdon
had
to
admit
it
seemed
far
fetched,
and
yet
the
pentacle
seemed
to
endorse
the
idea
on
some
level.
"All
I
am
saying
is
that
Mr.
Sauniere
dedicated
his
life
to
studying
the
history
of
the
goddess,
and
nothing
has
done
more
to
erase
that
history
than
the
Catholic
Church.
It
seems
reasonable
that
Sauniere
might
have
chosen
to
express
his
disappointment
in
his
final
good
bye."
"Disappointment?"
Fache
demanded,
sounding
hostile
now.
"This
message
sounds
more
enraged
than
disappointed,
wouldn't
you
say?"
Langdon
was
reaching
the
end
of
his
patience.
"Captain,
you
asked
for
my
instincts
as
to
what
Sauniere
is
trying
to
say
here,
and
that's
what
I'm
giving
you."
"That
this
is
an
indictment
of
the
Church?"
Fache's
jaw
tightened
as
he
spoke
through
clenched
teeth.
"Mr.
Langdon,
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
death
in
my
work,
and
let
me
tell
you
something.
When
a
man
is
murdered
by
another
man,
I
do
not
believe
his
final
thoughts
are
to
write
an
obscure
spiritual
statement
that
no
one
will
understand.
I
believe
he
is
thinking
of
one
thing
only."
Fache's
whispery
voice
sliced
the
air.
"La
vengeance.
I
believe
Sauniere
wrote
this
note
to
tell
us
who
killed
him."
Langdon
stared.
"But
that
makes
no
sense
whatsoever."
"No?"
"No,"
he
fired
back,
tired
and
frustrated.
"You
told
me
Sauniere
was
attacked
in
his
office
by
someone
he
had
apparently
invited
in."
"Yes."
"So
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
curator
knew
his
attacker."
Fache
nodded.
"Go
on."
"So
if
Sauniere
knew
the
person
who
killed
him,
what
kind
of
indictment
is
this?"
He
pointed
at
the
floor.
"Numeric
codes?
Lame
saints?
Draconian
devils?
Pentacles
on
his
stomach?
It's
all
too
cryptic."
Fache
frowned
as
if
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him.
"You
have
a
point."
"Considering
the
circumstances,"
Langdon
said,
"I
would
assume
that
if
Sauniere
wanted
to
tell
you
who
killed
him,
he
would
have
written
down
somebody's
name.
As
Langdon
spoke
those
words,
a
smug
smile
crossed
Fache's
lips
for
the
first
time
all
night.
"Precisement,
"
Fache
said.
"Precisement.
I
am
witnessing
the
work
of
a
master,
mused
Lieutenant
Collet
as
he
tweaked
his
audio
gear
and
listened
to
Fache's
voice
coming
through
the
headphones.
The
agent
superieur
knew
it
was
moments
like
these
that
had
lifted
