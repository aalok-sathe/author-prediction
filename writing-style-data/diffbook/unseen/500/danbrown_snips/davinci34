a
cloud,
and
the
air
around
him
smelled
sweet
with
candles.
Jesus
was
there,
staring
down
at
him.
am
here,
Jesus
said.
The
stone
has
been
rolled
aside,
and
you
are
born
again.
He
slept
and
awoke.
Fog
shrouded
his
thoughts.
He
had
never
believed
in
heaven,
and
yet
Jesus
was
watching
over
him.
Food
appeared
beside
his
bed,
and
the
ghost
ate
it,
almost
able
to
feel
the
flesh
materializing
on
his
bones.
He
slept
again.
When
he
awoke,
Jesus
was
still
smiling
down,
speaking.
You
are
saved,
my
son.
Blessed
are
those
who
follow
my
path.
Again,
he
slept.
It
was
a
scream
of
anguish
that
startled
the
ghost
from
his
slumber.
His
body
leapt
out
of
bed,
staggered
down
a
hallway
toward
the
sounds
of
shouting.
He
entered
into
a
kitchen
and
saw
a
large
man
beating
a
smaller
man.
Without
knowing
why,
the
ghost
grabbed
the
large
man
and
hurled
him
backward
against
a
wall.
The
man
fled,
leaving
the
ghost
standing
over
the
body
of
a
young
man
in
priest's
robes.
The
priest
had
a
badly
shattered
nose.
Lifting
the
bloody
priest,
the
ghost
carried
him
to
a
couch.
"Thank
you,
my
friend,"
the
priest
said
in
awkward
French.
"The
offertory
money
is
tempting
for
thieves.
You
speak
French
in
your
sleep.
Do
you
also
speak
Spanish?"
The
ghost
shook
his
head.
"What
is
your
name?"
he
continued
in
broken
French.
The
ghost
could
not
remember
the
name
his
parents
had
given
him.
All
he
heard
were
the
taunting
gibes
of
the
prison
guards.
The
priest
smiled.
"No
hay
problema.
My
name
is
Manuel
Aringarosa.
I
am
a
missionary
from
Madrid.
I
was
sent
here
to
build
a
church
for
the
Obra
de
Dios."
"Where
am
I?"
His
voice
sounded
hollow.
"Oviedo.
In
the
north
of
Spain."
"How
did
I
get
here?"
"Someone
left
you
on
my
doorstep.
You
were
ill.
I
fed
you.
You've
been
here
many
days."
The
ghost
studied
his
young
caretaker.
Years
had
passed
since
anyone
had
shown
any
kindness.
"Thank
you,
Father."
The
priest
touched
his
bloody
lip.
"It
is
I
who
am
thankful,
my
friend."
When
the
ghost
awoke
in
the
morning,
his
world
felt
clearer.
He
gazed
up
at
the
crucifix
on
the
wall
above
his
bed.
Although
it
no
longer
spoke
to
him,
he
felt
a
comforting
aura
in
its
presence.
Sitting
up,
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
newspaper
clipping
on
his
bedside
table.
The
article
was
in
French,
a
week
old.
When
he
read
the
story,
he
filled
with
fear.
It
told
of
an
earthquake
in
the
mountains
that
had
destroyed
a
prison
and
freed
many
dangerous
criminals.
His
heart
began
pounding.
The
priest
knows
who
I
am!
The
emotion
he
felt
was
one
he
had
not
felt
for
some
time.
Shame.
Guilt.
It
was
accompanied
by
the
fear
of
being
caught.
He
jumped
from
his
bed.
Where
do
I
run
?
"The
Book
of
Acts,"
a
voice
said
from
the
door.
The
ghost
turned,
