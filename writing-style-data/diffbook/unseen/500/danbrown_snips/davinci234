sunny
afternoons,
Londoners
picnic
beneath
the
willows
and
feed
the
pond's
resident
pelicans,
whose
ancestors
were
a
gift
to
Charles
II
from
the
Russian
ambassador.
The
Teacher
saw
no
pelicans
today.
The
stormy
weather
had
brought
instead
seagulls
from
the
ocean.
The
lawns
were
covered
with
them
hundreds
of
white
bodies
all
facing
the
same
direction,
patiently
riding
out
the
damp
wind.
Despite
the
morning
fog,
the
park
afforded
splendid
views
of
the
Houses
of
Parliament
and
Big
Ben.
Gazing
across
the
sloping
lawns,
past
the
duck
pond
and
the
delicate
silhouettes
of
the
weeping
willows,
the
Teacher
could
see
the
spires
of
the
building
that
housed
the
knight's
tomb
the
real
reason
he
had
told
Remy
to
come
to
this
spot.
As
the
Teacher
approached
the
front
passenger
door
of
the
parked
limousine,
Remy
leaned
across
and
opened
the
door.
The
Teacher
paused
outside,
taking
a
pull
from
the
flask
of
cognac
he
was
carrying.
Then,
dabbing
his
mouth,
he
slid
in
beside
Remy
and
closed
the
door.
Remy
held
up
the
keystone
like
a
trophy.
"It
was
almost
lost."
"You
have
done
well,"
the
Teacher
said.
"We
have
done
well,"
Remy
replied,
laying
the
keystone
in
the
Teacher's
eager
hands.
The
Teacher
admired
it
a
long
moment,
smiling.
"And
the
gun?
You
wiped
it
down?"
"Back
in
the
glove
box
where
I
found
it."
"Excellent."
The
Teacher
took
another
drink
of
cognac
and
handed
the
flask
to
Remy.
"Let's
toast
our
success.
The
end
is
near."
Remy
accepted
the
bottle
gratefully.
The
cognac
tasted
salty,
but
Remy
didn't
care.
He
and
the
Teacher
were
truly
partners
now.
He
could
feel
himself
ascending
to
a
higher
station
in
life.
will
never
be
a
servant
again.
As
Remy
gazed
down
the
embankment
at
the
duck
pond
below,
Chateau
Villette
seemed
miles
away.
Taking
another
swig
from
the
flask,
Remy
could
feel
the
cognac
warming
his
blood.
The
warmth
in
Remy's
throat,
however,
mutated
quickly
to
an
uncomfortable
heat.
Loosening
his
bow
tie,
Remy
tasted
an
unpleasant
grittiness
and
handed
the
flask
back
to
the
Teacher.
"I've
probably
had
enough,"
he
managed,
weakly.
Taking
the
flask,
the
Teacher
said,
"Remy,
as
you
are
aware,
you
are
the
only
one
who
knows
my
face.
I
placed
enormous
trust
in
you."
"Yes,"
he
said,
feeling
feverish
as
he
loosened
his
tie
further.
"And
your
identity
shall
go
with
me
to
the
grave."
The
Teacher
was
silent
a
long
moment.
"I
believe
you."
Pocketing
the
flask
and
the
keystone,
the
Teacher
reached
for
the
glove
box
and
pulled
out
the
tiny
Medusa
revolver.
For
an
instant,
Remy
felt
a
surge
of
fear,
but
the
Teacher
simply
slipped
it
in
his
trousers
pocket.
What
is
he
doing?
Remy
felt
himself
sweating
suddenly.
"I
know
I
promised
you
freedom,"
the
Teacher
said,
his
voice
now
sounding
regretful.
"But
considering
your
circumstances,
this
is
the
best
I
can
do."
The
swelling
in
Remy's
throat
came
on
like
an
earthquake,
and
he
lurched
against
the
steering
column,
grabbing
