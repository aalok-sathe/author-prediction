to
make
that
moment
possible."
"You?"
Sophie
declared,
glancing
up
now,
her
green
eyes
boring
into
him
with
rage
and
realization.
"You
are
the
one
responsible
for
my
grandfather's
murder?"
Teabing
scoffed.
"Your
grandfather
and
his
senechaux
were
traitors
to
the
Grail."
Sophie
felt
a
fury
rising
from
deep
within.
He's
lying!
Teabing's
voice
was
relentless.
"Your
grandfather
sold
out
to
the
Church.
It
is
obvious
they
pressured
him
to
keep
the
truth
quiet."
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"The
Church
had
no
influence
on
my
grandfather!"
Teabing
laughed
coldly.
"My
dear,
the
Church
has
two
thousand
years
of
experience
pressuring
those
who
threaten
to
unveil
its
lies.
Since
the
days
of
Constantine,
the
Church
has
successfully
hidden
the
truth
about
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus.
We
should
not
be
surprised
that
now,
once
again,
they
have
found
a
way
to
keep
the
world
in
the
dark.
The
Church
may
no
longer
employ
crusaders
to
slaughter
non
believers,
but
their
influence
is
no
less
persuasive.
No
less
insidious."
He
paused,
as
if
to
punctuate
his
next
point.
"Miss
Neveu,
for
some
time
now
your
grandfather
has
wanted
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family."
Sophie
was
stunned.
"How
could
you
know
that?"
"My
methods
are
immaterial.
The
important
thing
for
you
to
grasp
right
now
is
this."
He
took
a
deep
breath.
"The
deaths
of
your
mother,
father,
grandmother,
and
brother
were
not
accidental."
The
words
sent
Sophie's
emotions
reeling.
She
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
was
unable.
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"What
are
you
saying?"
"Robert,
it
explains
everything.
All
the
pieces
fit.
History
repeats
itself.
The
Church
has
a
precedent
of
murder
when
it
comes
to
silencing
the
Sangreal.
With
the
End
of
Days
imminent,
killing
the
Grand
Master's
loved
ones
sent
a
very
clear
message.
Be
quiet,
or
you
and
Sophie
are
next."
"It
was
a
car
accident,"
Sophie
stammered,
feeling
the
childhood
pain
welling
inside
her.
"An
accident!"
"Bedtime
stories
to
protect
your
innocence,"
Teabing
said.
"Consider
that
only
two
family
members
went
untouched
the
Priory's
Grand
Master
and
his
lone
granddaughter
the
perfect
pair
to
provide
the
Church
with
control
over
the
brotherhood.
I
can
only
imagine
the
terror
the
Church
wielded
over
your
grandfather
these
past
years,
threatening
to
kill
you
if
he
dared
release
the
Sangreal
secret,
threatening
to
finish
the
job
they
started
unless
Sauniere
influenced
the
Priory
to
reconsider
its
ancient
vow."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
argued,
now
visibly
riled,
"certainly
you
have
no
proof
that
the
Church
had
anything
to
do
with
those
deaths,
or
that
it
influenced
the
Priory's
decision
to
remain
silent."
"Proof?"
Teabing
fired
back.
"You
want
proof
the
Priory
was
influenced?
The
new
millennium
has
arrived,
and
yet
the
world
remains
ignorant!
Is
that
not
proof
enough?"
In
the
echoes
of
Teabing's
words,
Sophie
heard
another
voice
speaking.
Sophie,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family.
She
realized
she
was
trembling.
Could
this
possibly
be
that
truth
her
grandfather
had
wanted
to
tell
her?
That
her
