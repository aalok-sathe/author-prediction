the
niche's
star
filled
canopy.
What
orb
ought
to
be
here
and
yet
is
missing?
He
touched
the
cryptex
in
his
pocket
as
if
he
could
somehow
divine
the
answer
from
Sauniere's
crafted
marble.
Only
five
letters
separate
me
from
the
Grail.
Pacing
now
near
the
corner
of
the
choir
screen,
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
glanced
up
the
long
nave
toward
the
main
altar
in
the
distance.
His
gaze
dropped
from
the
gilded
altar
down
to
the
bright
crimson
robe
of
an
abbey
docent
who
was
being
waved
over
by
two
very
familiar
individuals.
Langdon
and
Neveu.
Calmly,
the
Teacher
moved
two
steps
back
behind
the
choir
screen.
That
was
fast.
He
had
anticipated
Langdon
and
Sophie
would
eventually
decipher
the
poem's
meaning
and
come
to
Newton's
tomb,
but
this
was
sooner
than
he
had
imagined.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
the
Teacher
considered
his
options.
He
had
grown
accustomed
to
dealing
with
surprises.
am
holding
the
cryptex.
Reaching
down
to
his
pocket,
he
touched
the
second
object
that
gave
him
his
confidence:
the
Medusa
revolver.
As
expected,
the
abbey's
metal
detectors
had
blared
as
the
Teacher
passed
through
with
the
concealed
gun.
Also
as
expected,
the
guards
had
backed
off
at
once
when
the
Teacher
glared
indignantly
and
flashed
his
identification
card.
Official
rank
always
commanded
the
proper
respect.
Although
initially
the
Teacher
had
hoped
to
solve
the
cryptex
alone
and
avoid
any
further
complications,
he
now
sensed
that
the
arrival
of
Langdon
and
Neveu
was
actually
a
welcome
development.
Considering
the
lack
of
success
he
was
having
with
the
"orb"
reference,
he
might
be
able
to
use
their
expertise.
After
all,
if
Langdon
had
deciphered
the
poem
to
find
the
tomb,
there
was
a
reasonable
chance
he
also
knew
something
about
the
orb.
And
if
Langdon
knew
the
password,
then
it
was
just
a
matter
of
applying
the
right
pressure.
Not
here,
of
course.
Somewhere
private.
The
Teacher
recalled
a
small
announcement
sign
he
had
seen
on
his
way
into
the
abbey.
Immediately
he
knew
the
perfect
place
to
lure
them.
The
only
question
now
what
to
use
as
bait.
Langdon
and
Sophie
moved
slowly
down
the
north
aisle,
keeping
to
the
shadows
behind
the
ample
pillars
that
separated
it
from
the
open
nave.
Despite
having
traveled
more
than
halfway
down
the
nave,
they
still
had
no
clear
view
of
Newton's
tomb.
The
sarcophagus
was
recessed
in
a
niche,
obscured
from
this
oblique
angle.
"At
least
there's
nobody
over
there,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
nodded,
relieved.
The
entire
section
of
the
nave
near
Newton's
tomb
was
deserted.
"I'll
go
over,"
he
whispered.
"You
should
stay
hidden
just
in
case
someone
Sophie
had
already
stepped
from
the
shadows
and
was
headed
across
the
open
floor.
"
is
watching,"
Langdon
sighed,
hurrying
to
join
her.
Crossing
the
massive
nave
on
a
diagonal,
Langdon
and
Sophie
remained
silent
as
the
elaborate
sepulchre
revealed
itself
in
tantalizing
increments
