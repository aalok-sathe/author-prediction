Langdon
wandering
alone
down
the
remaining
length
of
corridor,
but
he
took
comfort
in
knowing
the
Grand
Gallery
was
a
dead
end
whose
only
exit
was
at
the
other
end
the
gate
under
which
they
had
entered.
Although
French
fire
regulations
required
several
emergency
stairwells
for
a
space
this
large,
those
stairwells
had
been
sealed
automatically
when
Sauniere
tripped
the
security
system.
Granted,
that
system
had
now
been
reset,
unlocking
the
stairwells,
but
it
didn't
matter
the
external
doors,
if
opened,
would
set
off
fire
alarms
and
were
guarded
outside
by
DCPJ
agents.
Langdon
could
not
possibly
leave
without
Fache
knowing
about
it.
"I
need
to
return
to
Mr.
Sauniere's
office
for
a
moment,"
Fache
said.
"Please
come
find
me
directly,
Mr.
Langdon.
There
is
more
we
need
to
discuss."
Langdon
gave
a
quiet
wave
as
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness.
Turning,
Fache
marched
angrily
in
the
opposite
direction.
Arriving
at
the
gate,
he
slid
under,
exited
the
Grand
Gallery,
marched
down
the
hall,
and
stormed
into
the
command
center
at
Sauniere's
office.
"Who
gave
the
approval
to
let
Sophie
Neveu
into
this
building!"
Fache
bellowed.
Collet
was
the
first
to
answer.
"She
told
the
guards
outside
she'd
broken
the
code."
Fache
looked
around.
"Is
she
gone?"
"She's
not
with
you?"
"She
left."
Fache
glanced
out
at
the
darkened
hallway.
Apparently
Sophie
had
been
in
no
mood
to
stop
by
and
chat
with
the
other
officers
on
her
way
out.
For
a
moment,
Fache
considered
radioing
the
guards
in
the
entresol
and
telling
them
to
stop
Sophie
and
drag
her
back
up
here
before
she
could
leave
the
premises.
He
thought
better
of
it.
That
was
only
his
pride
talking
wanting
the
last
word.
He'd
had
enough
distractions
tonight.
Deal
with
Agent
Neveu
later,
he
told
himself,
already
looking
forward
to
firing
her.
Pushing
Sophie
from
his
mind,
Fache
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
miniature
knight
standing
on
Sauniere's
desk.
Then
he
turned
back
to
Collet.
"Do
you
have
him?"
Collet
gave
a
curt
nod
and
spun
the
laptop
toward
Fache.
The
red
dot
was
clearly
visible
on
the
floor
plan
overlay,
blinking
methodically
in
a
room
marked
TOILETTES
PUBLIQUES.
"Good,"
Fache
said,
lighting
a
cigarette
and
stalking
into
the
hall.
I've
got
a
phone
call
to
make.
Be
damned
sure
the
rest
room
is
the
only
place
Langdon
goes."
Robert
Langdon
felt
light
headed
as
he
trudged
toward
the
end
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
Sophie's
phone
message
played
over
and
over
in
his
mind.
At
the
end
of
the
corridor,
illuminated
signs
bearing
the
international
stick
figure
symbols
for
rest
rooms
guided
him
through
a
maze
like
series
of
dividers
displaying
Italian
drawings
and
hiding
the
rest
rooms
from
sight.
Finding
the
men's
room
door,
Langdon
entered
and
turned
on
the
lights.
The
room
was
empty.
Walking
to
the
sink,
he
splashed
cold
water
on
his
face
and
tried
to
wake
up.
Harsh
fluorescent
lights
glared
off
the
stark
tile,
and
the
room
smelled
of
ammonia.
As
he
