the
poem,
he
had
known
the
answer.
Even
so,
that
the
others
had
not
figured
it
out
was
not
surprising.
have
an
unfair
advantage.
Having
listened
to
Sauniere's
conversations
for
months
now,
the
Teacher
had
heard
the
Grand
Master
mention
this
famous
knight
on
occasion,
expressing
esteem
almost
matching
that
he
held
for
Da
Vinci.
The
poem's
reference
to
the
knight
was
brutally
simple
once
one
saw
it
a
credit
to
Sauniere's
wit
and
yet
how
this
tomb
would
reveal
the
final
password
was
still
a
mystery.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
The
Teacher
vaguely
recalled
photos
of
the
famous
tomb
and,
in
particular,
its
most
distinguishing
feature.
A
magnificent
orb.
The
huge
sphere
mounted
atop
the
tomb
was
almost
as
large
as
the
tomb
itself.
The
presence
of
the
orb
seemed
both
encouraging
and
troubling
to
the
Teacher.
On
one
hand,
it
felt
like
a
signpost,
and
yet,
according
to
the
poem,
the
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
was
an
orb
that
ought
to
be
on
his
tomb
not
one
that
was
already
there.
He
was
counting
on
his
closer
inspection
of
the
tomb
to
unveil
the
answer.
The
rain
was
getting
heavier
now,
and
he
tucked
the
cryptex
deep
in
his
right
hand
pocket
to
protect
it
from
the
dampness.
He
kept
the
tiny
Medusa
revolver
in
his
left,
out
of
sight.
Within
minutes,
he
was
stepping
into
the
quiet
sanctuary
of
London's
grandest
nine
hundred
year
old
building.
Just
as
the
Teacher
was
stepping
out
of
the
rain,
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
stepping
into
it.
On
the
rainy
tarmac
at
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport,
Aringarosa
emerged
from
his
cramped
plane,
bundling
his
cassock
against
the
cold
damp.
He
had
hoped
to
be
greeted
by
Captain
Fache.
Instead
a
young
British
police
officer
approached
with
an
umbrella.
"Bishop
Aringarosa?
Captain
Fache
had
to
leave.
He
asked
me
to
look
after
you.
He
suggested
I
take
you
to
Scotland
Yard.
He
thought
it
would
be
safest."
Safest?
Aringarosa
looked
down
at
the
heavy
briefcase
of
Vatican
bonds
clutched
in
his
hand.
He
had
almost
forgotten.
"Yes,
thank
you."
Aringarosa
climbed
into
the
police
car,
wondering
where
Silas
could
be.
Minutes
later,
the
police
scanner
crackled
with
the
answer.
5
Orme
Court.
Aringarosa
recognized
the
address
instantly.
The
Opus
Dei
Centre
in
London.
He
spun
to
the
driver.
"Take
me
there
at
once!"
Langdon's
eyes
had
not
left
the
computer
screen
since
the
search
began.
Five
minutes.
Only
two
hits.
Both
irrelevant.
He
was
starting
to
get
worried.
Pamela
Gettum
was
in
the
adjoining
room,
preparing
hot
drinks.
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
inquired
unwisely
if
there
might
be
some
coffee
brewing
alongside
the
tea
Gettum
had
offered,
and
from
the
sound
of
the
microwave
beeps
in
the
next
room,
Langdon
suspected
their
request
was
about
to
be
rewarded
with
instant
Nescafe.
Finally,
the
computer
pinged
happily.
"Sounds
like
you
got
another,"
Gettum
called
from
the
next
room.
"What's
the
title?"
Langdon
eyed
the
screen.
Grail
Allegory
