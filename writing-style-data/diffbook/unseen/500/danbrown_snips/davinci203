in
for
deceleration,
streaking
from
right
to
left
in
front
of
the
terminal,
its
white
hull
glistening
in
the
wet
weather.
But
rather
than
braking
and
turning
into
the
terminal,
the
jet
coasted
calmly
past
the
access
lane
and
continued
on
toward
Teabing's
hangar
in
the
distance.
All
the
police
spun
and
stared
at
Edwards.
"I
thought
you
said
the
pilot
agreed
to
come
to
the
terminal
!
Edwards
was
bewildered.
"He
did!"
Seconds
later,
Edwards
found
himself
wedged
in
a
police
car
racing
across
the
tarmac
toward
the
distant
hangar.
The
convoy
of
police
was
still
a
good
five
hundred
yards
away
as
Teabing's
Hawker
taxied
calmly
into
the
private
hangar
and
disappeared.
When
the
cars
finally
arrived
and
skidded
to
a
stop
outside
the
gaping
hangar
door,
the
police
poured
out,
guns
drawn.
Edwards
jumped
out
too.
The
noise
was
deafening.
The
Hawker's
engines
were
still
roaring
as
the
jet
finished
its
usual
rotation
inside
the
hangar,
positioning
itself
nose
out
in
preparation
for
later
departure.
As
the
plane
completed
its
180
degree
turn
and
rolled
toward
the
front
of
the
hangar,
Edwards
could
see
the
pilot's
face,
which
understandably
looked
surprised
and
fearful
to
see
the
barricade
of
police
cars.
The
pilot
brought
the
plane
to
a
final
stop,
and
powered
down
the
engines.
The
police
streamed
in,
taking
up
positions
around
the
jet.
Edwards
joined
the
Kent
chief
inspector,
who
moved
warily
toward
the
hatch.
After
several
seconds,
the
fuselage
door
popped
open.
Leigh
Teabing
appeared
in
the
doorway
as
the
plane's
electronic
stairs
smoothly
dropped
down.
As
he
gazed
out
at
the
sea
of
weapons
aimed
at
him,
he
propped
himself
on
his
crutches
and
scratched
his
head.
"Simon,
did
I
win
the
policemen's
lottery
while
I
was
away?"
He
sounded
more
bewildered
than
concerned.
Simon
Edwards
stepped
forward,
swallowing
the
frog
in
his
throat.
"Good
morning,
sir.
I
apologize
for
the
confusion.
We've
had
a
gas
leak
and
your
pilot
said
he
was
coming
to
the
terminal."
"Yes,
yes,
well,
I
told
him
to
come
here
instead.
I'm
late
for
an
appointment.
I
pay
for
this
hangar,
and
this
rubbish
about
avoiding
a
gas
leak
sounded
overcautious."
"I'm
afraid
your
arrival
has
taken
us
a
bit
off
guard,
sir."
"I
know.
I'm
off
my
schedule,
I
am.
Between
you
and
me,
the
new
medication
gives
me
the
tinkles.
Thought
I'd
come
over
for
a
tune
up."
The
policemen
all
exchanged
looks.
Edwards
winced.
"Very
good,
sir."
"Sir,"
the
Kent
chief
inspector
said,
stepping
forward.
"I
need
to
ask
you
to
stay
onboard
for
another
half
hour
or
so."
Teabing
looked
unamused
as
he
hobbled
down
the
stairs.
"I'm
afraid
that
is
impossible.
I
have
a
medical
appointment."
He
reached
the
tarmac.
"I
cannot
afford
to
miss
it."
The
chief
inspector
repositioned
himself
to
block
Teabing's
progress
away
from
the
plane.
"I
am
here
at
the
orders
of
the
French
Judicial
Police.
They
claim
you
are
transporting
fugitives
from
the
law
on
this
plane."
Teabing
