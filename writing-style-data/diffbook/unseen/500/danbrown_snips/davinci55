stairwell,
and
Sophie
carefully
pulled
open
the
door.
No
alarm
sounded.
Only
the
doors
to
the
outside
were
wired.
Sophie
led
Langdon
down
a
tight
set
of
switchback
stairs
toward
the
ground
level,
picking
up
speed
as
they
went.
"Your
grandfather,"
Langdon
said,
hurrying
behind
her,
"when
he
told
you
about
the
pentacle,
did
he
mention
goddess
worship
or
any
resentment
of
the
Catholic
Church?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"I
was
more
interested
in
the
mathematics
of
it
the
Divine
Proportion,
PHI,
Fibonacci
sequences,
that
sort
of
thing."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"Your
grandfather
taught
you
about
the
number
PHI?"
"Of
course.
The
Divine
Proportion."
Her
expression
turned
sheepish.
"In
fact,
he
used
to
joke
that
I
was
half
divine
you
know,
because
of
the
letters
in
my
name."
Langdon
considered
it
a
moment
and
then
groaned.
s
o
PHI
e.
Still
descending,
Langdon
refocused
on
PHI.
He
was
starting
to
realize
that
Sauniere's
clues
were
even
more
consistent
than
he
had
first
imagined.
Da
Vinci
Fibonacci
numbers
the
pentacle.
Incredibly,
all
of
these
things
were
connected
by
a
single
concept
so
fundamental
to
art
history
that
Langdon
often
spent
several
class
periods
on
the
topic.
PHI.
He
felt
himself
suddenly
reeling
back
to
Harvard,
standing
in
front
of
his
"Symbolism
in
Art"
class,
writing
his
favorite
number
on
the
chalkboard.
1.618
Langdon
turned
to
face
his
sea
of
eager
students.
"Who
can
tell
me
what
this
number
is?"
A
long
legged
math
major
in
back
raised
his
hand.
"That's
the
number
PHI."
He
pronounced
it
fee.
"Nice
job,
Stettner,"
Langdon
said.
"Everyone,
meet
PHI."
"Not
to
be
confused
with
PI,"
Stettner
added,
grinning.
"As
we
mathematicians
like
to
say:
PHI
is
one
H
of
a
lot
cooler
than
PI
!
Langdon
laughed,
but
nobody
else
seemed
to
get
the
joke.
Stettner
slumped.
"This
number
PHI,"
Langdon
continued,
"one
point
six
one
eight,
is
a
very
important
number
in
art.
Who
can
tell
me
why?"
Stettner
tried
to
redeem
himself.
"Because
it's
so
pretty?"
Everyone
laughed.
"Actually,"
Langdon
said,
"Stettner's
right
again.
PHI
is
generally
considered
the
most
beautiful
number
in
the
universe."
The
laughter
abruptly
stopped,
and
Stettner
gloated.
As
Langdon
loaded
his
slide
projector,
he
explained
that
the
number
PHI
was
derived
from
the
Fibonacci
sequence
a
progression
famous
not
only
because
the
sum
of
adjacent
terms
equaled
the
next
term,
but
because
the
quotients
of
adjacent
terms
possessed
the
astonishing
property
of
approaching
the
number
1.618
PHI!
Despite
PHI's
seemingly
mystical
mathematical
origins,
Langdon
explained,
the
truly
mind
boggling
aspect
of
PHI
was
its
role
as
a
fundamental
building
block
in
nature.
Plants,
animals,
and
even
human
beings
all
possessed
dimensional
properties
that
adhered
with
eerie
exactitude
to
the
ratio
of
PHI
to
1.
"PHI's
ubiquity
in
nature,"
Langdon
said,
killing
the
lights,
"clearly
exceeds
coincidence,
and
so
the
ancients
assumed
the
number
PHI
must
have
been
preordained
by
the
Creator
of
the
universe.
Early
scientists
heralded
one
point
six
one
eight
as
the
Divine
Proportion.
"Hold
on,"
