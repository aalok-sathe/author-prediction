was
not
sure
what
to
do
now
that
they
had
arrived.
The
poem
made
reference
to
a
"blade
and
chalice,"
which
Langdon
saw
nowhere.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
The
blade
and
chalice
guarding
o'er
Her
gates.
Again
Langdon
sensed
there
remained
some
facet
of
this
mystery
yet
to
reveal
itself.
"I
hate
to
pry,"
the
docent
said,
eyeing
the
rosewood
box
in
Langdon's
hands.
"But
this
box
might
I
ask
where
you
got
it?"
Langdon
gave
a
weary
laugh.
"That's
an
exceptionally
long
story."
The
young
man
hesitated,
his
eyes
on
the
box
again.
"It's
the
strangest
thing
my
grandmother
has
a
box
exactly
like
that
a
jewelry
box.
Identical
polished
rosewood,
same
inlaid
rose,
even
the
hinges
look
the
same."
Langdon
knew
the
young
man
must
be
mistaken.
If
ever
a
box
had
been
one
of
a
kind,
it
was
this
one
the
box
custom
made
for
the
Priory
keystone.
"The
two
boxes
may
be
similar
but
The
side
door
closed
loudly,
drawing
both
of
their
gazes.
Sophie
had
exited
without
a
word
and
was
now
wandering
down
the
bluff
toward
a
fieldstone
house
nearby.
Langdon
stared
after
her.
Where
is
she
going?
She
had
been
acting
strangely
ever
since
they
entered
the
building.
He
turned
to
the
docent.
"Do
you
know
what
that
house
is?"
He
nodded,
also
looking
puzzled
that
Sophie
was
going
down
there.
"That's
the
chapel
rectory.
The
chapel
curator
lives
there.
She
also
happens
to
be
the
head
of
the
Rosslyn
Trust."
He
paused.
"And
my
grandmother."
"Your
grandmother
heads
the
Rosslyn
Trust?"
The
young
man
nodded.
"I
live
with
her
in
the
rectory
and
help
keep
up
the
chapel
and
give
tours."
He
shrugged.
"I've
lived
here
my
whole
life.
My
grandmother
raised
me
in
that
house."
Concerned
for
Sophie,
Langdon
moved
across
the
chapel
toward
the
door
to
call
out
to
her.
He
was
only
halfway
there
when
he
stopped
short.
Something
the
young
man
said
just
registered.
My
grandmother
raised
me.
Langdon
looked
out
at
Sophie
on
the
bluff,
then
down
at
the
rosewood
box
in
his
hand.
Impossible.
Slowly,
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
young
man.
"You
said
your
grandmother
has
a
box
like
this
one?"
"Almost
identical."
"Where
did
she
get
it?"
"My
grandfather
made
it
for
her.
He
died
when
I
was
a
baby,
but
my
grandmother
still
talks
about
him.
She
says
he
was
a
genius
with
his
hands.
He
made
all
kinds
of
things."
Langdon
glimpsed
an
unimaginable
web
of
connections
emerging.
"You
said
your
grandmother
raised
you.
Do
you
mind
my
asking
what
happened
to
your
parents?"
The
young
man
looked
surprised.
"They
died
when
I
was
young."
He
paused.
"The
same
day
as
my
grandfather."
Langdon's
heart
pounded.
"In
a
car
accident?"
The
docent
recoiled,
a
look
of
bewilderment
in
his
olive
green
eyes.
"Yes.
In
a
car
accident.
My
entire
family
died
that
day.
I
lost
my
grandfather,
my
parents,
and"
He
hesitated,
glancing
down
at
the
floor.
"And
your
