his
arms
raise
instinctively
for
the
ceiling.
"Couchez
vous!"
the
guard
commanded.
"Lie
down!"
Langdon
was
face
first
on
the
floor
in
a
matter
of
seconds.
The
guard
hurried
over
and
kicked
his
legs
apart,
spreading
Langdon
out.
"Mauvaise
idee,
Monsieur
Langdon,
"
he
said,
pressing
the
gun
hard
into
Langdon's
back.
"Mauvaise
idee.
Face
down
on
the
parquet
floor
with
his
arms
and
legs
spread
wide,
Langdon
found
little
humor
in
the
irony
of
his
position.
The
Vitruvian
Man,
he
thought.
Face
down.
Inside
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
carried
the
heavy
iron
votive
candle
holder
from
the
altar
back
toward
the
obelisk.
The
shaft
would
do
nicely
as
a
battering
ram.
Eyeing
the
gray
marble
panel
that
covered
the
apparent
hollow
in
the
floor,
he
realized
he
could
not
possibly
shatter
the
covering
without
making
considerable
noise.
Iron
on
marble.
It
would
echo
off
the
vaulted
ceilings.
Would
the
nun
hear
him?
She
should
be
asleep
by
now.
Even
so,
it
was
a
chance
Silas
preferred
not
to
take.
Looking
around
for
a
cloth
to
wrap
around
the
tip
of
the
iron
pole,
he
saw
nothing
except
the
altar's
linen
mantle,
which
he
refused
to
defile.
My
cloak,
he
thought.
Knowing
he
was
alone
in
the
great
church,
Silas
untied
his
cloak
and
slipped
it
off
his
body.
As
he
removed
it,
he
felt
a
sting
as
the
wool
fibers
stuck
to
the
fresh
wounds
on
his
back.
Naked
now,
except
for
his
loin
swaddle,
Silas
wrapped
his
cloak
over
the
end
of
the
iron
rod.
Then,
aiming
at
the
center
of
the
floor
tile,
he
drove
the
tip
into
it.
A
muffled
thud.
The
stone
did
not
break.
He
drove
the
pole
into
it
again.
Again
a
dull
thud,
but
this
time
accompanied
by
a
crack.
On
the
third
swing,
the
covering
finally
shattered,
and
stone
shards
fell
into
a
hollow
area
beneath
the
floor.
A
compartment!
Quickly
pulling
the
remaining
pieces
from
the
opening,
Silas
gazed
into
the
void.
His
blood
pounded
as
he
knelt
down
before
it.
Raising
his
pale
bare
arm,
he
reached
inside.
At
first
he
felt
nothing.
The
floor
of
the
compartment
was
bare,
smooth
stone.
Then,
feeling
deeper,
reaching
his
arm
in
under
the
Rose
Line,
he
touched
something!
A
thick
stone
tablet.
Getting
his
fingers
around
the
edge,
he
gripped
it
and
gently
lifted
the
tablet
out.
As
he
stood
and
examined
his
find,
he
realized
he
was
holding
a
rough
hewn
stone
slab
with
engraved
words.
He
felt
for
an
instant
like
a
modern
day
Moses.
As
Silas
read
the
words
on
the
tablet,
he
felt
surprise.
He
had
expected
the
keystone
to
be
a
map,
or
a
complex
series
of
directions,
perhaps
even
encoded.
The
keystone,
however,
bore
the
simplest
of
inscriptions.
Job
38:11
A
Bible
verse
?
Silas
was
stunned
with
the
devilish
simplicity.
The
secret
location
of
that
which
they
sought
was
revealed
in
a
Bible
verse?
The
brotherhood
stopped
at
nothing
to
mock
the
righteous!
Job.
