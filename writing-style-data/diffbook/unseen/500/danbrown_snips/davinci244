pyramid
and
an
enormous
orb.
"Did
you
know
about
that?"
Sophie
said,
sounding
startled.
Langdon
shook
his
head,
also
surprised.
"Those
look
like
constellations
carved
on
it,"
Sophie
said.
As
they
approached
the
niche,
Langdon
felt
a
slow
sinking
sensation.
Newton's
tomb
was
covered
with
orbs
stars,
comets,
planets.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb?
It
could
turn
out
to
be
like
trying
to
find
a
missing
blade
of
grass
on
a
golf
course.
"Astronomical
bodies,"
Sophie
said,
looking
concerned.
"And
a
lot
of
them."
Langdon
frowned.
The
only
link
between
the
planets
and
the
Grail
that
Langdon
could
imagine
was
the
pentacle
of
Venus,
and
he
had
already
tried
the
password
"Venus"
en
route
to
the
Temple
Church.
Sophie
moved
directly
to
the
sarcophagus,
but
Langdon
hung
back
a
few
feet,
keeping
an
eye
on
the
abbey
around
them.
"Divinity,
"
Sophie
said,
tilting
her
head
and
reading
the
titles
of
the
books
on
which
Newton
was
leaning.
"Chronology.
Opticks.
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica?"
She
turned
to
him.
"Ring
any
bells?"
Langdon
stepped
closer,
considering
it.
"Principia
Mathematica,
as
I
remember,
has
something
to
do
with
the
gravitation
pull
of
planets
which
admittedly
are
orbs,
but
it
seems
a
little
far
fetched."
"How
about
the
signs
of
the
zodiac?"
Sophie
asked,
pointing
to
the
constellations
on
the
orb.
"You
were
talking
about
Pisces
and
Aquarius
earlier,
weren't
you?"
The
End
of
Days,
Langdon
thought.
"The
end
of
Pisces
and
the
beginning
of
Aquarius
was
allegedly
the
historical
marker
at
which
the
Priory
planned
to
release
the
Sangreal
documents
to
the
world."
But
the
millennium
came
and
went
without
incident,
leaving
historians
uncertain
when
the
truth
was
coming.
"It
seems
possible,"
Sophie
said,
"that
the
Priory's
plans
to
reveal
the
truth
might
be
related
to
the
last
line
of
the
poem."
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Langdon
felt
a
shiver
of
potential.
He
had
not
considered
the
line
that
way
before.
"You
told
me
earlier,"
she
said,
"that
the
timing
of
the
Priory's
plans
to
unveil
the
truth
about
'the
Rose'
and
her
fertile
womb
was
linked
directly
to
the
position
of
planets
orbs."
Langdon
nodded,
feeling
the
first
faint
wisps
of
possibility
materializing.
Even
so,
his
intuition
told
him
astronomy
was
not
the
key.
The
Grand
Master's
previous
solutions
had
all
possessed
an
eloquent,
symbolic
significance
the
Mona
Lisa,
Madonna
of
the
Rocks,
SOFIA.
This
eloquence
was
definitely
lacking
in
the
concept
of
planetary
orbs
and
the
zodiac.
Thus
far,
Jacques
Sauniere
had
proven
himself
a
meticulous
code
writer,
and
Langdon
had
to
believe
that
his
final
password
those
five
letters
that
unlocked
the
Priory's
ultimate
secret
would
prove
to
be
not
only
symbolically
fitting
but
also
crystal
clear.
If
this
solution
were
anything
like
the
others,
it
would
be
painfully
obvious
once
it
dawned.
"Look!"
Sophie
gasped,
jarring
his
thoughts
as
she
grabbed
his
arm.
From
the
fear
in
her
touch
Langdon
sensed
someone
must
be
approaching,
but
when
he
turned
