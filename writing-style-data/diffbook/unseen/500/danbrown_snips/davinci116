never
forget.
Furthermore,
it
perfectly
explained
why
the
scrambled
numbers
on
the
Louvre
floor
could
be
rearranged
to
form
the
famous
progression.
Sophie
reached
down
and
pressed
the
ENTER
key.
Nothing
happened.
At
least
nothing
they
could
detect.
At
that
moment,
beneath
them,
in
the
bank's
cavernous
subterranean
vault,
a
robotic
claw
sprang
to
life.
Sliding
on
a
double
axis
transport
system
attached
to
the
ceiling,
the
claw
headed
off
in
search
of
the
proper
coordinates.
On
the
cement
floor
below,
hundreds
of
identical
plastic
crates
lay
aligned
on
an
enormous
grid
like
rows
of
small
coffins
in
an
underground
crypt.
Whirring
to
a
stop
over
the
correct
spot
on
the
floor,
the
claw
dropped
down,
an
electric
eye
confirming
the
bar
code
on
the
box.
Then,
with
computer
precision,
the
claw
grasped
the
heavy
handle
and
hoisted
the
crate
vertically.
New
gears
engaged,
and
the
claw
transported
the
box
to
the
far
side
of
the
vault,
coming
to
a
stop
over
a
stationary
conveyor
belt.
Gently
now,
the
retrieval
arm
set
down
the
crate
and
retracted.
Once
the
arm
was
clear,
the
conveyor
belt
whirred
to
life.
Upstairs,
Sophie
and
Langdon
exhaled
in
relief
to
see
the
conveyor
belt
move.
Standing
beside
the
belt,
they
felt
like
weary
travelers
at
baggage
claim
awaiting
a
mysterious
piece
of
luggage
whose
contents
were
unknown.
The
conveyor
belt
entered
the
room
on
their
right
through
a
narrow
slit
beneath
a
retractable
door.
The
metal
door
slid
up,
and
a
huge
plastic
box
appeared,
emerging
from
the
depths
on
the
inclined
conveyor
belt.
The
box
was
black,
heavy
molded
plastic,
and
far
larger
than
she
imagined.
It
looked
like
an
air
freight
pet
transport
crate
without
any
airholes.
The
box
coasted
to
a
stop
directly
in
front
of
them.
Langdon
and
Sophie
stood
there,
silent,
staring
at
the
mysterious
container.
Like
everything
else
about
this
bank,
this
crate
was
industrial
metal
clasps,
a
bar
code
sticker
on
top,
and
molded
heavy
duty
handle.
Sophie
thought
it
looked
like
a
giant
toolbox.
Wasting
no
time,
Sophie
unhooked
the
two
buckles
facing
her.
Then
she
glanced
over
at
Langdon.
Together,
they
raised
the
heavy
lid
and
let
it
fall
back.
Stepping
forward,
they
peered
down
into
the
crate.
At
first
glance,
Sophie
thought
the
crate
was
empty.
Then
she
saw
something.
Sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
crate.
A
lone
item.
The
polished
wooden
box
was
about
the
size
of
a
shoebox
and
had
ornate
hinges.
The
wood
was
a
lustrous
deep
purple
with
a
strong
grain.
Rosewood,
Sophie
realized.
Her
grandfather's
favorite.
The
lid
bore
a
beautiful
inlaid
design
of
a
rose.
She
and
Langdon
exchanged
puzzled
looks.
Sophie
leaned
in
and
grabbed
the
box,
lifting
it
out.
My
God,
it's
heavy!
She
carried
it
gingerly
to
a
large
receiving
table
and
set
it
down.
Langdon
stood
beside
her,
both
of
them
staring
at
the
small
treasure
chest
her
grandfather
apparently
had
sent
them
to
retrieve.
Langdon
stared
in
wonderment
at
the
lid's
hand
