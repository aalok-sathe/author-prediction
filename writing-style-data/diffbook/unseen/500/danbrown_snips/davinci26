a
rudimentary
circle
glowed
around
the
curator's
body.
Sauniere
had
apparently
lay
down
and
swung
the
pen
around
himself
in
several
long
arcs,
essentially
inscribing
himself
inside
a
circle.
In
a
flash,
the
meaning
became
clear.
"The
Vitruvian
Man,
"
Langdon
gasped.
Sauniere
had
created
a
life
sized
replica
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
most
famous
sketch.
Considered
the
most
anatomically
correct
drawing
of
its
day,
Da
Vinci's
The
Vitruvian
Man
had
become
a
modern
day
icon
of
culture,
appearing
on
posters,
mouse
pads,
and
T
shirts
around
the
world.
The
celebrated
sketch
consisted
of
a
perfect
circle
in
which
was
inscribed
a
nude
male
his
arms
and
legs
outstretched
in
a
naked
spread
eagle.
Da
Vinci.
Langdon
felt
a
shiver
of
amazement.
The
clarity
of
Sauniere's
intentions
could
not
be
denied.
In
his
final
moments
of
life,
the
curator
had
stripped
off
his
clothing
and
arranged
his
body
in
a
clear
image
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
Vitruvian
Man.
The
circle
had
been
the
missing
critical
element.
A
feminine
symbol
of
protection,
the
circle
around
the
naked
man's
body
completed
Da
Vinci's
intended
message
male
and
female
harmony.
The
question
now,
though,
was
why
Sauniere
would
imitate
a
famous
drawing.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said,
"certainly
a
man
like
yourself
is
aware
that
Leonardo
da
Vinci
had
a
tendency
toward
the
darker
arts."
Langdon
was
surprised
by
Fache's
knowledge
of
Da
Vinci,
and
it
certainly
went
a
long
way
toward
explaining
the
captain's
suspicions
about
devil
worship.
Da
Vinci
had
always
been
an
awkward
subject
for
historians,
especially
in
the
Christian
tradition.
Despite
the
visionary's
genius,
he
was
a
flamboyant
homosexual
and
worshipper
of
Nature's
divine
order,
both
of
which
placed
him
in
a
perpetual
state
of
sin
against
God.
Moreover,
the
artist's
eerie
eccentricities
projected
an
admittedly
demonic
aura:
Da
Vinci
exhumed
corpses
to
study
human
anatomy;
he
kept
mysterious
journals
in
illegible
reverse
handwriting;
he
believed
he
possessed
the
alchemic
power
to
turn
lead
into
gold
and
even
cheat
God
by
creating
an
elixir
to
postpone
death;
and
his
inventions
included
horrific,
never
before
imagined
weapons
of
war
and
torture.
Misunderstanding
breeds
distrust,
Langdon
thought.
Even
Da
Vinci's
enormous
output
of
breathtaking
Christian
art
only
furthered
the
artist's
reputation
for
spiritual
hypocrisy.
Accepting
hundreds
of
lucrative
Vatican
commissions,
Da
Vinci
painted
Christian
themes
not
as
an
expression
of
his
own
beliefs
but
rather
as
a
commercial
venture
a
means
of
funding
a
lavish
lifestyle.
Unfortunately,
Da
Vinci
was
a
prankster
who
often
amused
himself
by
quietly
gnawing
at
the
hand
that
fed
him.
He
incorporated
in
many
of
his
Christian
paintings
hidden
symbolism
that
was
anything
but
Christian
tributes
to
his
own
beliefs
and
a
subtle
thumbing
of
his
nose
at
the
Church.
Langdon
had
even
given
a
lecture
once
at
the
National
Gallery
in
London
entitled:
"The
Secret
Life
of
Leonardo:
Pagan
Symbolism
in
Christian
Art."
"I
understand
your
concerns,"
Langdon
now
said,
"but
Da
Vinci
never
really
practiced
any
dark
arts.
He
was
an
exceptionally
spiritual
man,
albeit
