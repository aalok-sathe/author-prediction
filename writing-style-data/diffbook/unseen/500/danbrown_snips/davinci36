motivators.
"Une
plaisanterie
numerique?"
Bezu
Fache
was
livid,
glaring
at
Sophie
Neveu
in
disbelief.
A
numeric
joke?
"Your
professional
assessment
of
Sauniere's
code
is
that
it
is
some
kind
of
mathematical
prank?"
Fache
was
in
utter
incomprehension
of
this
woman's
gall.
Not
only
had
she
just
barged
in
on
Fache
without
permission,
but
she
was
now
trying
to
convince
him
that
Sauniere,
in
his
final
moments
of
life,
had
been
inspired
to
leave
a
mathematical
gag?
"This
code,"
Sophie
explained
in
rapid
French,
"is
simplistic
to
the
point
of
absurdity.
Jacques
Sauniere
must
have
known
we
would
see
through
it
immediately."
She
pulled
a
scrap
of
paper
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
handed
it
to
Fache.
"Here
is
the
decryption."
Fache
looked
at
the
card.

"This
is
it?"
he
snapped.
"All
you
did
was
put
the
numbers
in
increasing
order!"
Sophie
actually
had
the
nerve
to
give
a
satisfied
smile.
"Exactly."
Fache's
tone
lowered
to
a
guttural
rumble.
"Agent
Neveu,
I
have
no
idea
where
the
hell
you're
going
with
this,
but
I
suggest
you
get
there
fast."
He
shot
an
anxious
glance
at
Langdon,
who
stood
nearby
with
the
phone
pressed
to
his
ear,
apparently
still
listening
to
his
phone
message
from
the
U.S.
Embassy.
From
Langdon's
ashen
expression,
Fache
sensed
the
news
was
bad.
"Captain,"
Sophie
said,
her
tone
dangerously
defiant,
"the
sequence
of
numbers
you
have
in
your
hand
happens
to
be
one
of
the
most
famous
mathematical
progressions
in
history."
Fache
was
not
aware
there
even
existed
a
mathematical
progression
that
qualified
as
famous,
and
he
certainly
didn't
appreciate
Sophie's
off
handed
tone.
"This
is
the
Fibonacci
sequence,"
she
declared,
nodding
toward
the
piece
of
paper
in
Fache's
hand.
"A
progression
in
which
each
term
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
two
preceding
terms."
Fache
studied
the
numbers.
Each
term
was
indeed
the
sum
of
the
two
previous,
and
yet
Fache
could
not
imagine
what
the
relevance
of
all
this
was
to
Sauniere's
death.
"Mathematician
Leonardo
Fibonacci
created
this
succession
of
numbers
in
the
thirteenth
century.
Obviously
there
can
be
no
coincidence
that
all
of
the
numbers
Sauniere
wrote
on
the
floor
belong
to
Fibonacci's
famous
sequence."
Fache
stared
at
the
young
woman
for
several
moments.
"Fine,
if
there
is
no
coincidence,
would
you
tell
me
why
Jacques
Sauniere
chose
to
do
this.
What
is
he
saying?
What
does
this
mean?"
She
shrugged.
"Absolutely
nothing.
That's
the
point.
It's
a
simplistic
cryptographic
joke.
Like
taking
the
words
of
a
famous
poem
and
shuffling
them
at
random
to
see
if
anyone
recognizes
what
all
the
words
have
in
common."
Fache
took
a
menacing
step
forward,
placing
his
face
only
inches
from
Sophie's.
"I
certainly
hope
you
have
a
much
more
satisfying
explanation
than
that.
Sophie's
soft
features
grew
surprisingly
stern
as
she
leaned
in.
"Captain,
considering
what
you
have
at
stake
here
tonight,
I
thought
you
might
appreciate
knowing
that
Jacques
Sauniere
might
be
playing
games
with
you.
