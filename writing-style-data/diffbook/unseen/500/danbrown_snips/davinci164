clergy
murder
Priory
members
in
an
effort
to
find
and
destroy
documents
they
believe
are
false
testimony
anyway?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"The
ivory
towers
of
Harvard
have
made
you
soft,
Robert.
Yes,
the
clergy
in
Rome
are
blessed
with
potent
faith,
and
because
of
this,
their
beliefs
can
weather
any
storm,
including
documents
that
contradict
everything
they
hold
dear.
But
what
about
the
rest
of
the
world?
What
about
those
who
are
not
blessed
with
absolute
certainty?
What
about
those
who
look
at
the
cruelty
in
the
world
and
say,
where
is
God
today?
Those
who
look
at
Church
scandals
and
ask,
who
are
these
men
who
claim
to
speak
the
truth
about
Christ
and
yet
lie
to
cover
up
the
sexual
abuse
of
children
by
their
own
priests?"
Teabing
paused.
"What
happens
to
those
people,
Robert,
if
persuasive
scientific
evidence
comes
out
that
the
Church's
version
of
the
Christ
story
is
inaccurate,
and
that
the
greatest
story
ever
told
is,
in
fact,
the
greatest
story
ever
sold"
Langdon
did
not
respond.
"I'll
tell
you
what
happens
if
the
documents
get
out,"
Teabing
said.
"The
Vatican
faces
a
crisis
of
faith
unprecedented
in
its
two
millennia
history."
After
a
long
silence,
Sophie
said,
"But
if
it
is
the
Church
who
is
responsible
for
this
attack,
why
would
they
act
now?
After
all
these
years?
The
Priory
keeps
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden.
They
pose
no
immediate
threat
to
the
Church."
Teabing
heaved
an
ominous
sigh
and
glanced
at
Langdon.
"Robert,
I
assume
you
are
familiar
with
the
Priory's
final
charge?"
Langdon
felt
his
breath
catch
at
the
thought.
"I
am."
"Miss
Neveu,"
Teabing
said,
"the
Church
and
the
Priory
have
had
a
tacit
understanding
for
years.
That
is,
the
Church
does
not
attack
the
Priory,
and
the
Priory
keeps
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden."
He
paused.
"However,
part
of
the
Priory
history
has
always
included
a
plan
to
unveil
the
secret.
With
the
arrival
of
a
specific
date
in
history,
the
brotherhood
plans
to
break
the
silence
and
carry
out
its
ultimate
triumph
by
unveiling
the
Sangreal
documents
to
the
world
and
shouting
the
true
story
of
Jesus
Christ
from
the
mountaintops."
Sophie
stared
at
Teabing
in
silence.
Finally,
she
too
sat
down.
"And
you
think
that
date
is
approaching?
And
the
Church
knows
it?"
"A
speculation,"
Teabing
said,
"but
it
would
certainly
provide
the
Church
motivation
for
an
all
out
attack
to
find
the
documents
before
it
was
too
late.
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
Teabing
was
making
good
sense.
"Do
you
think
the
Church
would
actually
be
capable
of
uncovering
hard
evidence
of
the
Priory's
date?"
"Why
not
if
we're
assuming
the
Church
was
able
to
uncover
the
identities
of
the
Priory
members,
then
certainly
they
could
have
learned
of
their
plans.
And
even
if
they
don't
have
the
exact
date,
their
superstitions
may
be
getting
the
best
of
them."
"Superstitions?"
Sophie
asked.
"In
terms
of
prophecy,"
Teabing
said,
"we
are
currently
in
an
epoch
of
enormous
change.
The
millennium
