millions
of
people
cope
and
be
better
people."
"But
it
appears
their
reality
is
false."
Langdon
chuckled.
"No
more
false
than
that
of
a
mathematical
cryptographer
who
believes
in
the
imaginary
number
'V
because
it
helps
her
break
codes."
Sophie
frowned.
"That's
not
fair."
A
moment
passed.
"What
was
your
question
again?"
Langdon
asked.
"I
can't
remember."
He
smiled.
"Works
every
time."
Langdon's
Mickey
Mouse
wristwatch
read
almost
seven
thirty
when
he
emerged
from
the
Jaguar
limousine
onto
Inner
Temple
Lane
with
Sophie
and
Teabing.
The
threesome
wound
through
a
maze
of
buildings
to
a
small
courtyard
outside
the
Temple
Church.
The
rough
hewn
stone
shimmered
in
the
rain,
and
doves
cooed
in
the
architecture
overhead.
London's
ancient
Temple
Church
was
constructed
entirely
of
Caen
stone.
A
dramatic,
circular
edifice
with
a
daunting
facade,
a
central
turret,
and
a
protruding
nave
off
one
side,
the
church
looked
more
like
a
military
stronghold
than
a
place
of
worship.
Consecrated
on
the
tenth
of
February
in
1
185
by
Heraclius,
Patriarch
of
Jerusalem,
the
Temple
Church
survived
eight
centuries
of
political
turmoil,
the
Great
Fire
of
London,
and
the
First
World
War,
only
to
be
heavily
damaged
by
Luftwaffe
incendiary
bombs
in
1940.
After
the
war,
it
was
restored
to
its
original,
stark
grandeur.
The
simplicity
of
the
circle,
Langdon
thought,
admiring
the
building
for
the
first
time.
The
architecture
was
coarse
and
simple,
more
reminiscent
of
Rome's
rugged
Castel
Sant'Angelo
than
the
refined
Pantheon.
The
boxy
annex
jutting
out
to
the
right
was
an
unfortunate
eyesore,
although
it
did
little
to
shroud
the
original
pagan
shape
of
the
primary
structure.
"It's
early
on
a
Saturday,"
Teabing
said,
hobbling
toward
the
entrance,
"so
I'm
assuming
we
won't
have
services
to
deal
with."
The
church's
entryway
was
a
recessed
stone
niche
inside
which
stood
a
large
wooden
door.
To
the
left
of
the
door,
looking
entirely
out
of
place,
hung
a
bulletin
board
covered
with
concert
schedules
and
religious
service
announcements.
Teabing
frowned
as
he
read
the
board.
"They
don't
open
to
sightseers
for
another
couple
of
hours."
He
moved
to
the
door
and
tried
it.
The
door
didn't
budge.
Putting
his
ear
to
the
wood,
he
listened.
After
a
moment,
he
pulled
back,
a
scheming
look
on
his
face
as
he
pointed
to
the
bulletin
board.
"Robert,
check
the
service
schedule,
will
you?
Who
is
presiding
this
week?"
Inside
the
church,
an
altar
boy
was
almost
finished
vacuuming
the
communion
kneelers
when
he
heard
a
knocking
on
the
sanctuary
door.
He
ignored
it.
Father
Harvey
Knowles
had
his
own
keys
and
was
not
due
for
another
couple
of
hours.
The
knocking
was
probably
a
curious
tourist
or
indigent.
The
altar
boy
kept
vacuuming,
but
the
knocking
continued.
Can't
you
read?
The
sign
on
the
door
clearly
stated
that
the
church
did
not
open
until
nine
thirty
on
Saturday.
The
altar
boy
remained
with
his
chores.
Suddenly,
the
knocking
turned
to
a
forceful
banging,
as
if
someone
were
hitting
the
door
with
a
