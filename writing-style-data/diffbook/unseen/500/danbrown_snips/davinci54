the
floor
would
help
his
case?"
"The
Fibonacci
sequence?
The
P.S.?
All
the
Da
Vinci
and
goddess
symbolism?
That
had
to
be
my
grandfather."
Langdon
knew
she
was
right.
The
symbolism
of
the
clues
meshed
too
perfectly
the
pentacle,
The
Vitruvian
Man,
Da
Vinci,
the
goddess,
and
even
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
A
coherent
symbolic
set,
as
iconographers
would
call
it.
All
inextricably
tied.
"And
his
phone
call
to
me
this
afternoon,"
Sophie
added.
"He
said
he
had
to
tell
me
something.
I'm
certain
his
message
at
the
Louvre
was
his
final
effort
to
tell
me
something
important,
something
he
thought
you
could
help
me
understand.
Langdon
frowned.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint.
!
He
wished
he
could
comprehend
the
message,
both
for
Sophie's
well
being
and
for
his
own.
Things
had
definitely
gotten
worse
since
he
first
laid
eyes
on
the
cryptic
words.
His
fake
leap
out
the
bathroom
window
was
not
going
to
help
Langdon's
popularity
with
Fache
one
bit.
Somehow
he
doubted
the
captain
of
the
French
police
would
see
the
humor
in
chasing
down
and
arresting
a
bar
of
soap.
"The
doorway
isn't
much
farther,"
Sophie
said.
"Do
you
think
there's
a
possibility
that
the
numbers
in
your
grandfather's
message
hold
the
key
to
understanding
the
other
lines?"
Langdon
had
once
worked
on
a
series
of
Baconian
manuscripts
that
contained
epigraphical
ciphers
in
which
certain
lines
of
code
were
clues
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
other
lines.
"I've
been
thinking
about
the
numbers
all
night.
Sums,
quotients,
products.
I
don't
see
anything.
Mathematically,
they're
arranged
at
random.
Cryptographic
gibberish."
"And
yet
they're
all
part
of
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
That
can't
be
coincidence."
"It's
not.
Using
Fibonacci
numbers
was
my
grandfather's
way
of
waving
another
flag
at
me
like
writing
the
message
in
English,
or
arranging
himself
like
my
favorite
piece
of
art,
or
drawing
a
pentacle
on
himself.
All
of
it
was
to
catch
my
attention."
"The
pentacle
has
meaning
to
you?"
"Yes.
I
didn't
get
a
chance
to
tell
you,
but
the
pentacle
was
a
special
symbol
between
my
grandfather
and
me
when
I
was
growing
up.
We
used
to
play
Tarot
cards
for
fun,
and
my
indicator
card
always
turned
out
to
be
from
the
suit
of
pentacles.
I'm
sure
he
stacked
the
deck,
but
pentacles
got
to
be
our
little
joke."
Langdon
felt
a
chill.
They
played
Tarot?
The
medieval
Italian
card
game
was
so
replete
with
hidden
heretical
symbolism
that
Langdon
had
dedicated
an
entire
chapter
in
his
new
manuscript
to
the
Tarot.
The
game's
twenty
two
cards
bore
names
like
The
Female
Pope,
The
Empress,
and
The
Star.
Originally,
Tarot
had
been
devised
as
a
secret
means
to
pass
along
ideologies
banned
by
the
Church.
Now,
Tarot's
mystical
qualities
were
passed
on
by
modern
fortune
tellers.
The
Tarot
indicator
suit
for
feminine
divinity
is
pentacles,
Langdon
thought,
realizing
that
if
Sauniere
had
been
stacking
his
granddaughter's
deck
for
fun,
pentacles
was
an
apropos
inside
joke.
They
arrived
at
the
emergency
