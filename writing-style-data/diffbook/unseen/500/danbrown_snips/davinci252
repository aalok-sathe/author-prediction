himself
a
liability.
Every
Grail
quest
requires
sacrifice.
The
cleanest
solution
had
been
staring
Teabing
in
the
face
from
the
limousine's
wet
bar
a
flask,
some
cognac,
and
a
can
of
peanuts.
The
powder
at
the
bottom
of
the
can
would
be
more
than
enough
to
trigger
Remy's
deadly
allergy.
When
Remy
parked
the
limo
on
Horse
Guards
Parade,
Teabing
climbed
out
of
the
back,
walked
to
the
side
passenger
door,
and
sat
in
the
front
next
to
Remy.
Minutes
later,
Teabing
got
out
of
the
car,
climbed
into
the
rear
again,
cleaned
up
the
evidence,
and
finally
emerged
to
carry
out
the
final
phase
of
his
mission.
Westminster
Abbey
had
been
a
short
walk,
and
although
Teabing's
leg
braces,
crutches,
and
gun
had
set
off
the
metal
detector,
the
rent
a
cops
never
knew
what
to
do.
Do
we
ask
him
to
remove
his
braces
and
crawl
through?
Do
we
frisk
his
deformed
body?
Teabing
presented
the
flustered
guards
a
far
easier
solution
an
embossed
card
identifying
him
as
Knight
of
the
Realm.
The
poor
fellows
practically
tripped
over
one
another
ushering
him
in.
Now,
eyeing
the
bewildered
Langdon
and
Neveu,
Teabing
resisted
the
urge
to
reveal
how
he
had
brilliantly
implicated
Opus
Dei
in
the
plot
that
would
soon
bring
about
the
demise
of
the
entire
Church.
That
would
have
to
wait.
Right
now
there
was
work
to
do.
"Mes
amis,
"
Teabing
declared
in
flawless
French,
"vous
ne
trouvezpas
le
Saint
Graal,
c'est
le
Saint
Graal
qui
vous
trouve.
"
He
smiled.
"Our
paths
together
could
not
be
more
clear.
The
Grail
has
found
us."
Silence.
He
spoke
to
them
in
a
whisper
now.
"Listen.
Can
you
hear
it?
The
Grail
is
speaking
to
us
across
the
centuries.
She
is
begging
to
be
saved
from
the
Priory's
folly.
I
implore
you
both
to
recognize
this
opportunity.
There
could
not
possibly
be
three
more
capable
people
assembled
at
this
moment
to
break
the
final
code
and
open
the
cryptex."
Teabing
paused,
his
eyes
alight.
"We
need
to
swear
an
oath
together.
A
pledge
of
faith
to
one
another.
A
knight's
allegiance
to
uncover
the
truth
and
make
it
known."
Sophie
stared
deep
into
Teabing's
eyes
and
spoke
in
a
steely
tone.
"I
will
never
swear
an
oath
with
my
grandfather's
murderer.
Except
an
oath
that
I
will
see
you
go
to
prison."
Teabing's
heart
turned
grave,
then
resolute.
"I
am
sorry
you
feel
that
way,
mademoiselle."
He
turned
and
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon.
"And
you,
Robert?
Are
you
with
me,
or
against
me?"
Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa's
body
had
endured
many
kinds
of
pain,
and
yet
the
searing
heat
of
the
bullet
wound
in
his
chest
felt
profoundly
foreign
to
him.
Deep
and
grave.
Not
a
wound
of
the
flesh
but
closer
to
the
soul.
He
opened
his
eyes,
trying
to
see,
but
the
rain
on
his
face
blurred
his
vision.
Where
am
I?
He
could
feel
powerful
arms
holding
him,
carrying
his
limp
body
like
a
rag
