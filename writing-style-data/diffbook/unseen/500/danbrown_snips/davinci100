a
bibliography
of
over
fifty
titles
books
by
well
known
historians,
some
contemporary,
some
centuries
old
many
of
them
academic
bestsellers.
All
the
book
titles
suggested
the
same
premise
Langdon
had
just
proposed.
As
Faukman
read
down
the
list,
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
just
discovered
the
earth
was
actually
flat.
"I
know
some
of
these
authors.
They're
real
historians!"
Langdon
grinned.
"As
you
can
see,
Jonas,
this
is
not
only
my
theory.
It's
been
around
for
a
long
time.
I'm
simply
building
on
it.
No
book
has
yet
explored
the
legend
of
the
Holy
Grail
from
a
symbologic
angle.
The
iconographic
evidence
I'm
finding
to
support
the
theory
is,
well,
staggeringly
persuasive."
Faukman
was
still
staring
at
the
list.
"My
God,
one
of
these
books
was
written
by
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
a
British
Royal
Historian."
"Teabing
has
spent
much
of
his
life
studying
the
Holy
Grail.
I've
met
with
him.
He
was
actually
a
big
part
of
my
inspiration.
He's
a
believer,
Jonas,
along
with
all
of
the
others
on
that
list."
"You're
telling
me
all
of
these
historians
actually
believe"
Faukman
swallowed,
apparently
unable
to
say
the
words.
Langdon
grinned
again.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
arguably
the
most
sought
after
treasure
in
human
history.
The
Grail
has
spawned
legends,
wars,
and
lifelong
quests.
Does
it
make
sense
that
it
is
merely
a
cup?
If
so,
then
certainly
other
relics
should
generate
similar
or
greater
interest
the
Crown
of
Thorns,
the
True
Cross
of
the
Crucifixion,
the
Titulus
and
yet,
they
do
not.
Throughout
history,
the
Holy
Grail
has
been
the
most
special."
Langdon
grinned.
"Now
you
know
why."
Faukman
was
still
shaking
his
head.
"But
with
all
these
books
written
about
it,
why
isn't
this
theory
more
widely
known?"
"These
books
can't
possibly
compete
with
centuries
of
established
history,
especially
when
that
history
is
endorsed
by
the
ultimate
bestseller
of
all
time."
Faukman's
eyes
went
wide.
"Don't
tell
me
Harry
Potter
is
actually
about
the
Holy
Grail."
"I
was
referring
to
the
Bible."
Faukman
cringed.
"I
knew
that."
"Laissez
le!"
Sophie's
shouts
cut
the
air
inside
the
taxi.
"Put
it
down!"
Langdon
jumped
as
Sophie
leaned
forward
over
the
seat
and
yelled
at
the
taxi
driver.
Langdon
could
see
the
driver
was
clutching
his
radio
mouthpiece
and
speaking
into
it.
Sophie
turned
now
and
plunged
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
Langdon's
tweed
jacket.
Before
Langdon
knew
what
had
happened,
she
had
yanked
out
the
pistol,
swung
it
around,
and
was
pressing
it
to
the
back
of
the
driver's
head.
The
driver
instantly
dropped
his
radio,
raising
his
one
free
hand
overhead.
"Sophie!"
Langdon
choked.
"What
the
hell"
"Arretez!
"
Sophie
commanded
the
driver.
Trembling,
the
driver
obeyed,
stopping
the
car
and
putting
it
in
park.
It
was
then
that
Langdon
heard
the
metallic
voice
of
the
taxi
company's
dispatcher
coming
from
the
dashboard,
"qui
s'appette
Agent
Sophie
Neveu"
the
radio
crackled.
"Et
un
Americain,
Robert
Langdon"
Langdon's
muscles
turned
rigid.
They
found
us
already?
"Descendez,
