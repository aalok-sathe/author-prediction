top
ten
most
intriguing
people
a
dubious
honor
that
made
him
the
brunt
of
endless
ribbing
by
his
Harvard
colleagues.
Tonight,
three
thousand
miles
from
home,
the
accolade
had
resurfaced
to
haunt
him
at
the
lecture
he
had
given.
"Ladies
and
gentlemen"
the
hostess
had
announced
to
a
full
house
at
the
American
University
of
Paris's
Pavilion
Dauphine,
"Our
guest
tonight
needs
no
introduction.
He
is
the
author
of
numerous
books:
The
Symbology
of
Secret
Sects,
The
An
of
the
Illuminati,
The
Lost
Language
of
Ideograms,
and
when
I
say
he
wrote
the
book
on
Religious
Iconology,
I
mean
that
quite
literally.
Many
of
you
use
his
textbooks
in
class."
The
students
in
the
crowd
nodded
enthusiastically.
"I
had
planned
to
introduce
him
tonight
by
sharing
his
impressive
curriculum
vitae.
However"
She
glanced
playfully
at
Langdon,
who
was
seated
onstage.
"An
audience
member
has
just
handed
me
a
far
more,
shall
we
say
intriguing
introduction."
She
held
up
a
copy
of
Boston
Magazine.
Langdon
cringed.
Where
the
hell
did
she
get
that?
The
hostess
began
reading
choice
excerpts
from
the
inane
article,
and
Langdon
felt
himself
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
his
chair.
Thirty
seconds
later,
the
crowd
was
grinning,
and
the
woman
showed
no
signs
of
letting
up.
"And
Mr.
Langdon's
refusal
to
speak
publicly
about
his
unusual
role
in
last
year's
Vatican
conclave
certainly
wins
him
points
on
our
intrigue
o
meter."
The
hostess
goaded
the
crowd.
"Would
you
like
to
hear
more?"
The
crowd
applauded.
Somebody
stop
her,
Langdon
pleaded
as
she
dove
into
the
article
again.
"Although
Professor
Langdon
might
not
be
considered
hunk
handsome
like
some
of
our
younger
awardees,
this
forty
something
academic
has
more
than
his
share
of
scholarly
allure.
His
captivating
presence
is
punctuated
by
an
unusually
low,
baritone
speaking
voice,
which
his
female
students
describe
as
'chocolate
for
the
ears.'
The
hall
erupted
in
laughter.
Langdon
forced
an
awkward
smile.
He
knew
what
came
next
some
ridiculous
line
about
"Harrison
Ford
in
Harris
tweed"
and
because
this
evening
he
had
figured
it
was
finally
safe
again
to
wear
his
Harris
tweed
and
Burberry
turtleneck,
he
decided
to
take
action.
"Thank
you,
Monique,"
Langdon
said,
standing
prematurely
and
edging
her
away
from
the
podium.
"Boston
Magazine
clearly
has
a
gift
for
fiction."
He
turned
to
the
audience
with
an
embarrassed
sigh.
"And
if
I
find
which
one
of
you
provided
that
article,
I'll
have
the
consulate
deport
you."
The
crowd
laughed.
"Well,
folks,
as
you
all
know,
I'm
here
tonight
to
talk
about
the
power
of
symbols"
The
ringing
of
Langdon's
hotel
phone
once
again
broke
the
silence.
Groaning
in
disbelief,
he
picked
up.
"Yes?"
As
expected,
it
was
the
concierge.
"Mr.
Langdon,
again
my
apologies.
I
am
calling
to
inform
you
that
your
guest
is
now
en
route
to
your
room.
I
thought
I
should
alert
you."
Langdon
was
wide
awake
now.
"You
sent
someone
to
my
room?"
"I
apologize,
monsieur,
but
a
man
like
this
I
cannot
presume
the
authority
