They
were
standing
in
an
enormous
dead
end.
The
creaking
of
a
heavy
door
behind
them
made
them
turn,
just
as
the
door
closed
with
a
resounding
thud
and
the
latch
fell
into
place.
The
lone
man
who
had
been
standing
behind
the
door
looked
calm
as
he
aimed
a
small
revolver
at
them.
He
was
portly
and
was
propped
on
a
pair
of
aluminum
crutches.
For
a
moment
Langdon
thought
he
must
be
dreaming.
It
was
Leigh
Teabing.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
felt
rueful
as
he
gazed
out
over
the
barrel
of
his
Medusa
revolver
at
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu.
"My
friends,"
he
said,
"since
the
moment
you
walked
into
my
home
last
night,
I
have
done
everything
in
my
power
to
keep
you
out
of
harm's
way.
But
your
persistence
has
now
put
me
in
a
difficult
position."
He
could
see
the
expressions
of
shock
and
betrayal
on
Sophie's
and
Langdon's
faces,
and
yet
he
was
confident
that
soon
they
would
both
understand
the
chain
of
events
that
had
guided
the
three
of
them
to
this
unlikely
crossroads.
There
is
so
much
I
have
to
tell
you
both
so
much
you
do
not
yet
understand.
"Please
believe,"
Teabing
said,
"I
never
had
any
intention
of
your
being
involved.
You
came
to
my
home.
You
came
searching
for
me.
"Leigh?"
Langdon
finally
managed.
"What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
We
thought
you
were
in
trouble.
We
came
here
to
help
you!"
"As
I
trusted
you
would,"
he
said.
"We
have
much
to
discuss."
Langdon
and
Sophie
seemed
unable
to
tear
their
stunned
gazes
from
the
revolver
aimed
at
them.
"It
is
simply
to
ensure
your
full
attention,"
Teabing
said.
"If
I
had
wanted
to
harm
you,
you
would
be
dead
by
now.
When
you
walked
into
my
home
last
night,
I
risked
everything
to
spare
your
lives.
I
am
a
man
of
honor,
and
I
vowed
in
my
deepest
conscience
only
to
sacrifice
those
who
had
betrayed
the
Sangreal."
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
Langdon
said.
"Betrayed
the
Sangreal?"
"I
discovered
a
terrible
truth,"
Teabing
said,
sighing.
"I
learned
why
the
Sangreal
documents
were
never
revealed
to
the
world.
I
learned
that
the
Priory
had
decided
not
to
release
the
truth
after
all.
That's
why
the
millennium
passed
without
any
revelation,
why
nothing
happened
as
we
entered
the
End
of
Days."
Langdon
drew
a
breath,
about
to
protest.
"The
Priory,"
Teabing
continued,
"was
given
a
sacred
charge
to
share
the
truth.
To
release
the
Sangreal
documents
when
the
End
of
Days
arrived.
For
centuries,
men
like
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
and
Newton
risked
everything
to
protect
the
documents
and
carry
out
that
charge.
And
now,
at
the
ultimate
moment
of
truth,
Jacques
Sauniere
changed
his
mind.
The
man
honored
with
the
greatest
responsibility
in
Christian
history
eschewed
his
duty.
He
decided
the
time
was
not
right."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie.
"He
failed
the
Grail.
He
failed
the
Priory.
And
he
failed
the
memory
of
all
the
generations
that
had
worked
