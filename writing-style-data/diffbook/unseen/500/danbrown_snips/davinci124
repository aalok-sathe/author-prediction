twenty
six
to
the
fifth
power."
She
quickly
estimated
the
permutations.
"Approximately
twelve
million
possibilities."
"If
you
say
so,"
Langdon
said,
looking
like
he
had
approximately
twelve
million
questions
running
through
his
head.
"What
information
do
you
think
is
inside?"
"Whatever
it
is,
my
grandfather
obviously
wanted
very
badly
to
keep
it
secret."
She
paused,
closing
the
box
lid
and
eyeing
the
five
petal
Rose
inlaid
on
it.
Something
was
bothering
her.
"Did
you
say
earlier
that
the
Rose
is
a
symbol
for
the
Grail?"
"Exactly.
In
Priory
symbolism,
the
Rose
and
the
Grail
are
synonymous."
Sophie
furrowed
her
brow.
"That's
strange,
because
my
grandfather
always
told
me
the
Rose
meant
secrecy.
He
used
to
hang
a
rose
on
his
office
door
at
home
when
he
was
having
a
confidential
phone
call
and
didn't
want
me
to
disturb
him.
He
encouraged
me
to
do
the
same."
Sweetie,
her
grandfather
said,
rather
than
lock
each
other
out,
we
can
each
hang
a
rose
lafleur
des
secrets
on
our
door
when
we
need
privacy.
This
way
we
learn
to
respect
and
trust
each
other.
Hanging
a
rose
is
an
ancient
Roman
custom.
"Sub
rosa,
"
Langdon
said.
"The
Romans
hung
a
rose
over
meetings
to
indicate
the
meeting
was
confidential.
Attendees
understood
that
whatever
was
said
under
the
rose
or
sub
rosa
had
to
remain
a
secret."
Langdon
quickly
explained
that
the
Rose's
overtone
of
secrecy
was
not
the
only
reason
the
Priory
used
it
as
a
symbol
for
the
Grail.
Rosa
rugosa,
one
of
the
oldest
species
of
rose,
had
five
petals
and
pentagonal
symmetry,
just
like
the
guiding
star
of
Venus,
giving
the
Rose
strong
iconographic
ties
to
womanhood.
In
addition,
the
Rose
had
close
ties
to
the
concept
of
"true
direction"
and
navigating
one's
way.
The
Compass
Rose
helped
travelers
navigate,
as
did
Rose
Lines,
the
longitudinal
lines
on
maps.
For
this
reason,
the
Rose
was
a
symbol
that
spoke
of
the
Grail
on
many
levels
secrecy,
womanhood,
and
guidance
the
feminine
chalice
and
guiding
star
that
led
to
secret
truth.
As
Langdon
finished
his
explanation,
his
expression
seemed
to
tighten
suddenly.
"Robert?
Are
you
okay?"
His
eyes
were
riveted
to
the
rosewood
box.
"Sub
rosa,
"
he
choked,
a
fearful
bewilderment
sweeping
across
his
face.
"It
can't
be."
"What?"
Langdon
slowly
raised
his
eyes.
"Under
the
sign
of
the
Rose,"
he
whispered.
"This
cryptex
I
think
I
know
what
it
is."
Langdon
could
scarcely
believe
his
own
supposition,
and
yet,
considering
who
had
given
this
stone
cylinder
to
them,
how
he
had
given
it
to
them,
and
now,
the
inlaid
Rose
on
the
container,
Langdon
could
formulate
only
one
conclusion.
am
holding
the
Priory
keystone.
The
legend
was
specific.
The
keystone
is
an
encoded
stone
that
lies
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
watching
him.
"What's
going
on?"
Langdon
needed
a
moment
to
gather
his
thoughts.
"Did
your
grandfather
ever
speak
to
you
of
something
called
la
clef
de
voiite?"
"The
key
to
the
vault?"
