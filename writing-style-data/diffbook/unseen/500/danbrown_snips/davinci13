out
through
a
series
of
interconnected
galleries.
Langdon
followed,
his
vision
slowly
adjusting
to
the
dark.
All
around,
large
format
oils
began
to
materialize
like
photos
developing
before
him
in
an
enormous
darkroom
their
eyes
following
as
he
moved
through
the
rooms.
He
could
taste
the
familiar
tang
of
museum
air
an
arid,
deionized
essence
that
carried
a
faint
hint
of
carbon
the
product
of
industrial,
coal
filter
dehumidifiers
that
ran
around
the
clock
to
counteract
the
corrosive
carbon
dioxide
exhaled
by
visitors.
Mounted
high
on
the
walls,
the
visible
security
cameras
sent
a
clear
message
to
visitors:
We
see
you.
Do
not
touch
anything.
"Any
of
them
real?"
Langdon
asked,
motioning
to
the
cameras.
Fache
shook
his
head.
"Of
course
not."
Langdon
was
not
surprised.
Video
surveillance
in
museums
this
size
was
cost
prohibitive
and
ineffective.
With
acres
of
galleries
to
watch
over,
the
Louvre
would
require
several
hundred
technicians
simply
to
monitor
the
feeds.
Most
large
museums
now
used
"containment
security."
Forget
keeping
thieves
out.
Keep
them
in.
Containment
was
activated
after
hours,
and
if
an
intruder
removed
a
piece
of
artwork,
compartmentalized
exits
would
seal
around
that
gallery,
and
the
thief
would
find
himself
behind
bars
even
before
the
police
arrived.
The
sound
of
voices
echoed
down
the
marble
corridor
up
ahead.
The
noise
seemed
to
be
coming
from
a
large
recessed
alcove
that
lay
ahead
on
the
right.
A
bright
light
spilled
out
into
the
hallway.
"Office
of
the
curator,"
the
captain
said.
As
he
and
Fache
drew
nearer
the
alcove,
Langdon
peered
down
a
short
hallway,
into
Sauniere's
luxurious
study
warm
wood,
Old
Master
paintings,
and
an
enormous
antique
desk
on
which
stood
a
two
foot
tall
model
of
a
knight
in
full
armor.
A
handful
of
police
agents
bustled
about
the
room,
talking
on
phones
and
taking
notes.
One
of
them
was
seated
at
Sauniere's
desk,
typing
into
a
laptop.
Apparently,
the
curator's
private
office
had
become
DCPJ's
makeshift
command
post
for
the
evening.
"Messieurs,
"
Fache
called
out,
and
the
men
turned.
"Ne
nous
derangez
pas
sous
aucun
pretexte.
Entendu?"
Everyone
inside
the
office
nodded
their
understanding.
Langdon
had
hung
enough
NE
PAS
DERANGER
signs
on
hotel
room
doors
to
catch
the
gist
of
the
captain's
orders.
Fache
and
Langdon
were
not
to
be
disturbed
under
any
circumstances.
Leaving
the
small
congregation
of
agents
behind,
Fache
led
Langdon
farther
down
the
darkened
hallway.
Thirty
yards
ahead
loomed
the
gateway
to
the
Louvre's
most
popular
section
la
Grande
Galerie
a
seemingly
endless
corridor
that
housed
the
Louvre's
most
valuable
Italian
masterpieces.
Langdon
had
already
discerned
that
this
was
where
Sauniere's
body
lay;
the
Grand
Gallery's
famous
parquet
floor
had
been
unmistakable
in
the
Polaroid.
As
they
approached,
Langdon
saw
the
entrance
was
blocked
by
an
enormous
steel
grate
that
looked
like
something
used
by
medieval
castles
to
keep
out
marauding
armies.
"Containment
security,
"
Fache
said,
as
they
neared
the
grate.
Even
in
the
darkness,
the
barricade
looked
like
it
could
have
restrained
a
