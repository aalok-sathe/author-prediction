bizarre
was
the
series
of
numbers.
"Part
of
it
looks
like
a
numeric
cipher.
"Yes,"
Fache
said.
"Our
cryptographers
are
already
working
on
it.
We
believe
these
numbers
may
be
the
key
to
who
killed
him.
Maybe
a
telephone
exchange
or
some
kind
of
social
identification.
Do
the
numbers
have
any
symbolic
meaning
to
you?"
Langdon
looked
again
at
the
digits,
sensing
it
would
take
him
hours
to
extract
any
symbolic
meaning.
If
Sauniere
had
even
intended
any.
To
Langdon,
the
numbers
looked
totally
random.
He
was
accustomed
to
symbolic
progressions
that
made
some
semblance
of
sense,
but
everything
here
the
pentacle,
the
text,
the
numbers
seemed
disparate
at
the
most
fundamental
level.
"You
alleged
earlier,"
Fache
said,
"that
Sauniere's
actions
here
were
all
in
an
effort
to
send
some
sort
of
message
goddess
worship
or
something
in
that
vein?
How
does
this
message
fit
in?"
Langdon
knew
the
question
was
rhetorical.
This
bizarre
communique
obviously
did
not
fit
Langdon's
scenario
of
goddess
worship
at
all.
O,
Draconian
devil?
Oh,
lame
saint?
Fache
said,
"This
text
appears
to
be
an
accusation
of
some
sort.
Wouldn't
you
agree?"
Langdon
tried
to
imagine
the
curator's
final
minutes
trapped
alone
in
the
Grand
Gallery,
knowing
he
was
about
to
die.
It
seemed
logical.
"An
accusation
against
his
murderer
makes
sense,
I
suppose."
"My
job,
of
course,
is
to
put
a
name
to
that
person.
Let
me
ask
you
this,
Mr.
Langdon.
To
your
eye,
beyond
the
numbers,
what
about
this
message
is
most
strange?"
Most
strange?
A
dying
man
had
barricaded
himself
in
the
gallery,
drawn
a
pentacle
on
himself,
and
scrawled
a
mysterious
accusation
on
the
floor.
What
about
the
scenario
wasn't
strange?
"The
word
'Draconian'?"
he
ventured,
offering
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind.
Langdon
was
fairly
certain
that
a
reference
to
Draco
the
ruthless
seventh
century
B.C.
politician
was
an
unlikely
dying
thought.
"
'Draconian
devil'
seems
an
odd
choice
of
vocabulary."
"Draconian?"
Fache's
tone
came
with
a
tinge
of
impatience
now.
"Sauniere's
choice
of
vocabulary
hardly
seems
the
primary
issue
here."
Langdon
wasn't
sure
what
issue
Fache
had
in
mind,
but
he
was
starting
to
suspect
that
Draco
and
Fache
would
have
gotten
along
well.
"Sauniere
was
a
Frenchman,"
Fache
said
flatly.
"He
lived
in
Paris.
And
yet
he
chose
to
write
this
message"
"In
English,"
Langdon
said,
now
realizing
the
captain's
meaning.
Fache
nodded.
"Precisement.
Any
idea
why?"
Langdon
knew
Sauniere
spoke
impeccable
English,
and
yet
the
reason
he
had
chosen
English
as
the
language
in
which
to
write
his
final
words
escaped
Langdon.
He
shrugged.
Fache
motioned
back
to
the
pentacle
on
Sauniere's
abdomen.
"Nothing
to
do
with
devil
worship?
Are
you
still
certain?"
Langdon
was
certain
of
nothing
anymore.
"The
symbology
and
text
don't
seem
to
coincide.
I'm
sorry
I
can't
be
of
more
help."
"Perhaps
this
will
clarify."
Fache
backed
away
from
the
body
and
raised
the
black
light
again,
letting
the
beam
spread
out
in
a
wider
angle.
"And
now?"
To
Langdon's
amazement,
