floor.
The
final
line
hit
Langdon
like
a
kick
in
the
gut.

O,
Draconian
devil
!
Oh,
lame
saint!
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon
For
several
seconds,
Langdon
stared
in
wonder
at
the
photograph
of
Sauniere's
postscript.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
He
felt
as
if
the
floor
were
tilting
beneath
his
feet.
Sauniere
left
a
postscript
with
my
name
on
it?
In
his
wildest
dreams,
Langdon
could
not
fathom
why.
"Now
do
you
understand,"
Sophie
said,
her
eyes
urgent,
"why
Fache
ordered
you
here
tonight,
and
why
you
are
his
primary
suspect?"
The
only
thing
Langdon
understood
at
the
moment
was
why
Fache
had
looked
so
smug
when
Langdon
suggested
Sauniere
would
have
accused
his
killer
by
name.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
"Why
would
Sauniere
write
this?"
Langdon
demanded,
his
confusion
now
giving
way
to
anger.
"Why
would
I
want
to
kill
Jacques
Sauniere?"
"Fache
has
yet
to
uncover
a
motive,
but
he
has
been
recording
his
entire
conversation
with
you
tonight
in
hopes
you
might
reveal
one."
Langdon
opened
his
mouth,
but
still
no
words
came.
"He's
fitted
with
a
miniature
microphone,"
Sophie
explained.
"It's
connected
to
a
transmitter
in
his
pocket
that
radios
the
signal
back
to
the
command
post."
"This
is
impossible,"
Langdon
stammered.
"I
have
an
alibi.
I
went
directly
back
to
my
hotel
after
my
lecture.
You
can
ask
the
hotel
desk."
"Fache
already
did.
His
report
shows
you
retrieving
your
room
key
from
the
concierge
at
about
ten
thirty.
Unfortunately,
the
time
of
the
murder
was
closer
to
eleven.
You
easily
could
have
left
your
hotel
room
unseen."
"This
is
insanity!
Fache
has
no
evidence!"
Sophie's
eyes
widened
as
if
to
say:
No
evidence?
"Mr.
Langdon,
your
name
is
written
on
the
floor
beside
the
body,
and
Sauniere's
date
book
says
you
were
with
him
at
approximately
the
time
of
the
murder."
She
paused.
"Fache
has
more
than
enough
evidence
to
take
you
into
custody
for
questioning."
Langdon
suddenly
sensed
that
he
needed
a
lawyer.
"I
didn't
do
this."
Sophie
sighed.
"This
is
not
American
television,
Mr.
Langdon.
In
France,
the
laws
protect
the
police,
not
criminals.
Unfortunately,
in
this
case,
there
is
also
the
media
consideration.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
a
very
prominent
and
well
loved
figure
in
Paris,
and
his
murder
will
be
news
in
the
morning.
Fache
will
be
under
immediate
pressure
to
make
a
statement,
and
he
looks
a
lot
better
having
a
suspect
in
custody
already.
Whether
or
not
you
are
guilty,
you
most
certainly
will
be
held
by
DCPJ
until
they
can
figure
out
what
really
happened."
Langdon
felt
like
a
caged
animal.
"Why
are
you
telling
me
all
this?"
"Because,
Mr.
Langdon,
I
believe
you
are
innocent."
Sophie
looked
away
for
a
moment
and
then
back
into
his
eyes.
"And
also
because
it
is
partially
my
fault
that
you're
in
trouble."
"I'm
sorry?
It's
your
fault
Sauniere
is
trying
to
frame
me?"
"Sauniere
wasn't
trying
to
frame
you.
It
was
a
mistake.
