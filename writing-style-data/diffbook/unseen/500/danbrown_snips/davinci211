metal
rod.
The
young
man
switched
off
his
vacuum
cleaner
and
marched
angrily
toward
the
door.
Unlatching
it
from
within,
he
swung
it
open.
Three
people
stood
in
the
entryway.
Tourists,
he
grumbled.
"We
open
at
nine
thirty."
The
heavyset
man,
apparently
the
leader,
stepped
forward
using
metal
crutches.
"I
am
Sir
Leigh
Teabing,"
he
said,
his
accent
a
highbrow,
Saxonesque
British.
"As
you
are
no
doubt
aware,
I
am
escorting
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Christopher
Wren
the
Fourth."
He
stepped
aside,
flourishing
his
arm
toward
the
attractive
couple
behind
them.
The
woman
was
soft
featured,
with
lush
burgundy
hair.
The
man
was
tall,
dark
haired,
and
looked
vaguely
familiar.
The
altar
boy
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
Sir
Christopher
Wren
was
the
Temple
Church's
most
famous
benefactor.
He
had
made
possible
all
the
restorations
following
damage
caused
by
the
Great
Fire.
He
had
also
been
dead
since
the
early
eighteenth
century.
"Urn
an
honor
to
meet
you?"
The
man
on
crutches
frowned.
"Good
thing
you're
not
in
sales,
young
man,
you're
not
very
convincing.
Where
is
Father
Knowles?"
"It's
Saturday.
He's
not
due
in
until
later."
The
crippled
man's
scowl
deepened.
"There's
gratitude.
He
assured
us
he
would
be
here,
but
it
looks
like
we'll
do
it
without
him.
It
won't
take
long."
The
altar
boy
remained
blocking
the
doorway.
"I'm
sorry,
what
won't
take
long?"
The
visitor's
eyes
sharpened
now,
and
he
leaned
forward
whispering
as
if
to
save
everyone
some
embarrassment.
"Young
man,
apparently
you
are
new
here.
Every
year
Sir
Christopher
Wren's
descendants
bring
a
pinch
of
the
old
man's
ashes
to
scatter
in
the
Temple
sanctuary.
It
is
part
of
his
last
will
and
testament.
Nobody
is
particularly
happy
about
making
the
trip,
but
what
can
we
do?"
The
altar
boy
had
been
here
a
couple
of
years
but
had
never
heard
of
this
custom.
"It
would
be
better
if
you
waited
until
nine
thirty.
The
church
isn't
open
yet,
and
I'm
not
finished
hoovering."
The
man
on
crutches
glared
angrily.
"Young
man,
the
only
reason
there's
anything
left
of
this
building
for
you
to
hoover
is
on
account
of
the
gentleman
in
that
woman's
pocket."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Mrs.
Wren,"
the
man
on
crutches
said,
"would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
show
this
impertinent
young
man
the
reliquary
of
ashes?"
The
woman
hesitated
a
moment
and
then,
as
if
awaking
from
a
trance,
reached
in
her
sweater
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
small
cylinder
wrapped
in
protective
fabric.
"There,
you
see?"
the
man
on
crutches
snapped.
"Now,
you
can
either
grant
his
dying
wish
and
let
us
sprinkle
his
ashes
in
the
sanctuary,
or
I
tell
Father
Knowles
how
we've
been
treated."
The
altar
boy
hesitated,
well
acquainted
with
Father
Knowles'
deep
observance
of
church
tradition
and,
more
importantly,
with
his
foul
temper
when
anything
cast
this
time
honored
shrine
in
anything
but
favorable
light.
Maybe
Father
Knowles
had
simply
forgotten
these
family
members
were
coming.
If
so,
then
there
was
far
more
risk
