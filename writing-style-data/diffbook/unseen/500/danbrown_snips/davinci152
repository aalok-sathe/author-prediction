No
wonder
the
priest
is
mad,
Sophie
thought.
"It's
pornography!
Sacrilege!"
the
priest
yelled,
emerging
from
the
study
and
storming
to
the
front
door.
"How
can
you
possibly
endorse
that!
This
American
Martin
Scorsese
is
a
blasphemer,
and
the
Church
will
permit
him
no
pulpit
in
France
!
"
The
priest
slammed
the
door
on
his
way
out.
When
her
grandfather
came
into
the
kitchen,
he
saw
Sophie
with
the
paper
and
frowned.
"You're
quick."
Sophie
said,
"You
think
Jesus
Christ
had
a
girlfriend?"
"No,
dear,
I
said
the
Church
should
not
be
allowed
to
tell
us
what
notions
we
can
and
can't
entertain.
"Did
Jesus
have
a
girlfriend?"
Her
grandfather
was
silent
for
several
moments.
"Would
it
be
so
bad
if
He
did?"
Sophie
considered
it
and
then
shrugged.
"I
wouldn't
mind."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
was
still
talking.
"I
shan't
bore
you
with
the
countless
references
to
Jesus
and
Magdalene's
union.
That
has
been
explored
ad
nauseum
by
modern
historians.
I
would,
however,
like
to
point
out
the
following."
He
motioned
to
another
passage.
"This
is
from
the
Gospel
of
Mary
Magdalene."
Sophie
had
not
known
a
gospel
existed
in
Magdalene's
words.
She
read
the
text:
And
Peter
said,
"Did
the
Saviour
really
speak
with
a
woman
without
our
knowledge
?
Are
we
to
turn
about
and
all
listen
to
her?
Did
he
prefer
her
to
us?"
And
Levi
answered,
"Peter,
you
have
always
been
hot
tempered.
Now
I
see
you
contending
against
the
woman
like
an
adversary.
If
the
Saviour
made
her
worthy,
who
are
you
indeed
to
reject
her?
Surely
the
Saviour
knows
her
very
well.
That
is
why
he
loved
her
more
than
us.
"The
woman
they
are
speaking
of,"
Teabing
explained,
"is
Mary
Magdalene.
Peter
is
jealous
of
her."
"Because
Jesus
preferred
Mary?"
"Not
only
that.
The
stakes
were
far
greater
than
mere
affection.
At
this
point
in
the
gospels,
Jesus
suspects
He
will
soon
be
captured
and
crucified.
So
He
gives
Mary
Magdalene
instructions
on
how
to
carry
on
His
Church
after
He
is
gone.
As
a
result,
Peter
expresses
his
discontent
over
playing
second
fiddle
to
a
woman.
I
daresay
Peter
was
something
of
a
sexist."
Sophie
was
trying
to
keep
up.
"This
is
Saint
Peter.
The
rock
on
which
Jesus
built
His
Church."
"The
same,
except
for
one
catch.
According
to
these
unaltered
gospels,
it
was
not
Peter
to
whom
Christ
gave
directions
with
which
to
establish
the
Christian
Church.
It
was
Mary
Magdalene.
Sophie
looked
at
him.
"You're
saying
the
Christian
Church
was
to
be
carried
on
by
a
woman?"
"That
was
the
plan.
Jesus
was
the
original
feminist.
He
intended
for
the
future
of
His
Church
to
be
in
the
hands
of
Mary
Magdalene."
"And
Peter
had
a
problem
with
that,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
to
The
Last
Supper.
"That's
Peter
there.
You
can
see
that
Da
Vinci
was
well
aware
of
how
Peter
felt
about
Mary
Magdalene."
Again,
Sophie
was
speechless.
In
the
painting,
Peter
was
leaning
menacingly
toward
Mary
