one
of
the
bearer
bonds.
He
handed
it
to
the
pilot.
"What
is
this?"
the
pilot
demanded.
"A
ten
thousand
euro
bearer
bond
drawn
on
the
Vatican
Bank."
The
pilot
looked
dubious.
"It's
the
same
as
cash."
"Only
cash
is
cash,"
the
pilot
said,
handing
the
bond
back.
Aringarosa
felt
weak
as
he
steadied
himself
against
the
cockpit
door.
"This
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death.
You
must
help
me.
I
need
to
get
to
London."
The
pilot
eyed
the
bishop's
gold
ring.
"Real
diamonds?"
Aringarosa
looked
at
the
ring.
"I
could
not
possibly
part
with
this."
The
pilot
shrugged,
turning
and
focusing
back
out
the
windshield.
Aringarosa
felt
a
deepening
sadness.
He
looked
at
the
ring.
Everything
it
represented
was
about
to
be
lost
to
the
bishop
anyway.
After
a
long
moment,
he
slid
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
placed
it
gently
on
the
instrument
panel.
Aringarosa
slunk
out
of
the
cockpit
and
sat
back
down.
Fifteen
seconds
later,
he
could
feel
the
pilot
banking
a
few
more
degrees
to
the
north.
Even
so,
Aringarosa's
moment
of
glory
was
in
shambles.
It
had
all
begun
as
a
holy
cause.
A
brilliantly
crafted
scheme.
Now,
like
a
house
of
cards,
it
was
collapsing
in
on
itself
and
the
end
was
nowhere
in
sight.
Langdon
could
see
Sophie
was
still
shaken
from
recounting
her
experience
of
Hieros
Gamos.
For
his
part,
Langdon
was
amazed
to
have
heard
it.
Not
only
had
Sophie
witnessed
the
full
blown
ritual,
but
her
own
grandfather
had
been
the
celebrant
the
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion.
It
was
heady
company.
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Isaac
Newton,
Victor
Hugo,
Jean
Cocteau
Jacques
Sauniere.
"I
don't
know
what
else
I
can
tell
you,"
Langdon
said
softly.
Sophie's
eyes
were
a
deep
green
now,
tearful.
"He
raised
me
like
his
own
daughter."
Langdon
now
recognized
the
emotion
that
had
been
growing
in
her
eyes
as
they
spoke.
It
was
remorse.
Distant
and
deep.
Sophie
Neveu
had
shunned
her
grandfather
and
was
now
seeing
him
in
an
entirely
different
light.
Outside,
the
dawn
was
coming
fast,
its
crimson
aura
gathering
off
the
starboard.
The
earth
was
still
black
beneath
them.
"Victuals,
my
dears?"
Teabing
rejoined
them
with
a
flourish,
presenting
several
cans
of
Coke
and
a
box
of
old
crackers.
He
apologized
profusely
for
the
limited
fare
as
he
doled
out
the
goods.
"Our
friend
the
monk
isn't
talking
yet,"
he
chimed,
"but
give
him
time."
He
bit
into
a
cracker
and
eyed
the
poem.
"So,
my
lovely,
any
headway?"
He
looked
at
Sophie.
"What
is
your
grandfather
trying
to
tell
us
here?
Where
the
devil
is
this
headstone?
This
headstone
praised
by
Templars."
Sophie
shook
her
head
and
remained
silent.
While
Teabing
again
dug
into
the
verse,
Langdon
popped
a
Coke
and
turned
to
the
window,
his
thoughts
awash
with
images
of
secret
rituals
and
unbroken
codes.
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars
is
the
key.
He
took
a
long
sip
from
the
can.
A
headstone
praised
