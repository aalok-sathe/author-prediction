of
Da
Vinci's
inventions
was
one
of
her
grandfather's
best
loved
hobbies.
A
talented
craftsman
who
spent
hours
in
his
wood
and
metal
shop,
Jacques
Sauniere
enjoyed
imitating
master
craftsmen
Faberge,
assorted
cloisonne
artisans,
and
the
less
artistic,
but
far
more
practical,
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Even
a
cursory
glance
through
Da
Vinci's
journals
revealed
why
the
luminary
was
as
notorious
for
his
lack
of
follow
through
as
he
was
famous
for
his
brilliance.
Da
Vinci
had
drawn
up
blueprints
for
hundreds
of
inventions
he
had
never
built.
One
of
Jacques
Sauniere's
favorite
pastimes
was
bringing
Da
Vinci's
more
obscure
brainstorms
to
life
timepieces,
water
pumps,
cryptexes,
and
even
a
fully
articulated
model
of
a
medieval
French
knight,
which
now
stood
proudly
on
the
desk
in
his
office.
Designed
by
Da
Vinci
in
1495
as
an
outgrowth
of
his
earliest
anatomy
and
kinesiology
studies,
the
internal
mechanism
of
the
robot
knight
possessed
accurate
joints
and
tendons,
and
was
designed
to
sit
up,
wave
its
arms,
and
move
its
head
via
a
flexible
neck
while
opening
and
closing
an
anatomically
correct
jaw.
This
armor
clad
knight,
Sophie
had
always
believed,
was
the
most
beautiful
object
her
grandfather
had
ever
built
that
was,
until
she
had
seen
the
cryptex
in
this
rosewood
box.
"He
made
me
one
of
these
when
I
was
little,"
Sophie
said.
"But
I've
never
seen
one
so
ornate
and
large."
Langdon's
eyes
had
never
left
the
box.
"I've
never
heard
of
a
cryptex."
Sophie
was
not
surprised.
Most
of
Leonardo's
unbuilt
inventions
had
never
been
studied
or
even
named.
The
term
cryptex
possibly
had
been
her
grandfather's
creation,
an
apt
title
for
this
device
that
used
the
science
of
cryptology
to
protect
information
written
on
the
contained
scroll
or
codex.
Da
Vinci
had
been
a
cryptology
pioneer,
Sophie
knew,
although
he
was
seldom
given
credit.
Sophie's
university
instructors,
while
presenting
computer
encryption
methods
for
securing
data,
praised
modern
cryptologists
like
Zimmerman
and
Schneier
but
failed
to
mention
that
it
was
Leonardo
who
had
invented
one
of
the
first
rudimentary
forms
of
public
key
encryption
centuries
ago.
Sophie's
grandfather,
of
course,
had
been
the
one
to
tell
her
all
about
that.
As
their
armored
truck
roared
down
the
highway,
Sophie
explained
to
Langdon
that
the
cryptex
had
been
Da
Vinci's
solution
to
the
dilemma
of
sending
secure
messages
over
long
distances.
In
an
era
without
telephones
or
e
mail,
anyone
wanting
to
convey
private
information
to
someone
far
away
had
no
option
but
to
write
it
down
and
then
trust
a
messenger
to
carry
the
letter.
Unfortunately,
if
a
messenger
suspected
the
letter
might
contain
valuable
information,
he
could
make
far
more
money
selling
the
information
to
adversaries
than
he
could
delivering
the
letter
properly.
Many
great
minds
in
history
had
invented
cryptologic
solutions
to
the
challenge
of
data
protection:
Julius
Caesar
devised
a
code
writing
scheme
called
the
Caesar
Box;
Mary,
Queen
of
Scots
created
a
transposition
cipher
and
sent
secret
communiques
from
prison;
and
the
brilliant
Arab
scientist
