tore
into
the
wall
above
him.
The
reverberation
shook
the
back
of
the
truck
as
a
spent
shell
clinked
onto
the
cargo
floor.
Shit!
Langdon
froze.
Vernet
spoke
more
confidently
now.
"Mr.
Langdon,
pick
up
the
box."
Langdon
lifted
the
box.
"Now
bring
it
over
to
me."
Vernet
was
taking
dead
aim,
standing
on
the
ground
behind
the
rear
bumper,
his
gun
outstretched
into
the
cargo
hold
now.
Box
in
hand,
Langdon
moved
across
the
hold
toward
the
open
door.
I've
got
to
do
something!
Langdon
thought.
I'm
about
to
hand
over
the
Priory
keystone!
As
Langdon
moved
toward
the
doorway,
his
position
of
higher
ground
became
more
pronounced,
and
he
began
wondering
if
he
could
somehow
use
it
to
his
advantage.
Vernet's
gun,
though
raised,
was
at
Langdon's
knee
level.
A
well
placed
kick
perhaps?
Unfortunately,
as
Langdon
neared,
Vernet
seemed
to
sense
the
dangerous
dynamic
developing,
and
he
took
several
steps
back,
repositioning
himself
six
feet
away.
Well
out
of
reach.
Vernet
commanded,
"Place
the
box
beside
the
door."
Seeing
no
options,
Langdon
knelt
down
and
set
the
rosewood
box
at
the
edge
of
the
cargo
hold,
directly
in
front
of
the
open
doors.
"Now
stand
up."
Langdon
began
to
stand
up
but
paused,
spying
the
small,
spent
pistol
shell
on
the
floor
beside
the
truck's
precision
crafted
doorsill.
"Stand
up,
and
step
away
from
the
box."
Langdon
paused
a
moment
longer,
eyeing
the
metal
threshold.
Then
he
stood.
As
he
did,
he
discreetly
brushed
the
shell
over
the
edge
onto
the
narrow
ledge
that
was
the
door's
lower
sill.
Fully
upright
now,
Langdon
stepped
backward.
"Return
to
the
back
wall
and
turn
around."
Langdon
obeyed.
Vernet
could
feel
his
own
heart
pounding.
Aiming
the
gun
with
his
right
hand,
he
reached
now
with
his
left
for
the
wooden
box.
He
discovered
that
it
was
far
too
heavy.
need
two
hands.
Turning
his
eyes
back
to
his
captives,
he
calculated
the
risk.
Both
were
a
good
fifteen
feet
away,
at
the
far
end
of
the
cargo
hold,
facing
away
from
him.
Vernet
made
up
his
mind.
Quickly,
he
laid
down
the
gun
on
the
bumper,
lifted
the
box
with
two
hands,
and
set
it
on
the
ground,
immediately
grabbing
the
gun
again
and
aiming
it
back
into
the
hold.
Neither
of
his
prisoners
had
moved.
Perfect.
Now
all
that
remained
was
to
close
and
lock
the
door.
Leaving
the
box
on
the
ground
for
the
moment,
he
grabbed
the
metal
door
and
began
to
heave
it
closed.
As
the
door
swung
past
him,
Vernet
reached
up
to
grab
the
single
bolt
that
needed
to
be
slid
into
place.
The
door
closed
with
a
thud,
and
Vernet
quickly
grabbed
the
bolt,
pulling
it
to
the
left.
The
bolt
slid
a
few
inches
and
crunched
to
an
unexpected
halt,
not
lining
up
with
its
sleeve.
What's
going
on?
Vernet
pulled
again,
but
the
bolt
wouldn't
lock.
The
mechanism
was
not
properly
aligned.
The
door
isn't
fully
closed!
Feeling
a
surge
