his
eyes,
he
stepped
backward,
out
into
the
room's
vast
empty
spaces.
Neutral
ground.
He
hoped
his
focus
on
the
cryptex
signaled
Teabing
that
collaboration
might
be
an
option,
and
that
his
silence
signaled
Sophie
he
had
not
abandoned
her.
All
the
while
buying
time
to
think.
The
act
of
thinking,
Langdon
suspected,
was
exactly
what
Teabing
wanted
him
to
do.
That's
why
he
handed
me
the
cryptex.
So
I
could
feel
the
weight
of
my
decision.
The
British
historian
hoped
the
touch
of
the
Grand
Master's
cryptex
would
make
Langdon
fully
grasp
the
magnitude
of
its
contents,
coaxing
his
academic
curiosity
to
overwhelm
all
else,
forcing
him
to
realize
that
failure
to
unlock
the
keystone
would
mean
the
loss
of
history
itself.
With
Sophie
at
gunpoint
across
the
room,
Langdon
feared
that
discovering
the
cryptex's
elusive
password
would
be
his
only
remaining
hope
of
bartering
her
release.
If
I
can
free
the
map,
Teabing
will
negotiate.
Forcing
his
mind
to
this
critical
task,
Langdon
moved
slowly
toward
the
far
windows
allowing
his
mind
to
fill
with
the
numerous
astronomical
images
on
Newton's
tomb.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Turning
his
back
to
the
others,
he
walked
toward
the
towering
windows,
searching
for
any
inspiration
in
their
stained
glass
mosaics.
There
was
none.
Place
yourself
in
Sauniere's
mind,
he
urged,
gazing
outward
now
into
College
Garden.
What
would
he
believe
is
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
Newton's
tomb?
Images
of
stars,
comets,
and
planets
twinkled
in
the
falling
rain,
but
Langdon
ignored
them.
Sauniere
was
not
a
man
of
science.
He
was
a
man
of
humanity,
of
art,
of
history.
The
sacred
feminine
the
chalice
the
Rose
the
banished
Mary
Magdalene
the
decline
of
the
goddess
the
Holy
Grail.
Legend
had
always
portrayed
the
Grail
as
a
cruel
mistress,
dancing
in
the
shadows
just
out
of
sight,
whispering
in
your
ear,
luring
you
one
more
step
and
then
evaporating
into
the
mist.
Gazing
out
at
the
rustling
trees
of
College
Garden,
Langdon
sensed
her
playful
presence.
The
signs
were
everywhere.
Like
a
taunting
silhouette
emerging
from
the
fog,
the
branches
of
Britain's
oldest
apple
tree
burgeoned
with
five
petaled
blossoms,
all
glistening
like
Venus.
The
goddess
was
in
the
garden
now.
She
was
dancing
in
the
rain,
singing
songs
of
the
ages,
peeking
out
from
behind
the
bud
filled
branches
as
if
to
remind
Langdon
that
the
fruit
of
knowledge
was
growing
just
beyond
his
reach.
Across
the
room,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
watched
with
confidence
as
Langdon
gazed
out
the
window
as
if
under
a
spell.
Exactly
as
I
hoped,
Teabing
thought.
He
will
come
around.
For
some
time
now,
Teabing
had
suspected
Langdon
might
hold
the
key
to
the
Grail.
It
was
no
coincidence
that
Teabing
launched
his
plan
into
action
on
the
same
night
Langdon
was
scheduled
to
meet
Jacques
Sauniere.
Listening
in
on
the
curator,
Teabing
was
certain
the
man's
eagerness
to
meet
