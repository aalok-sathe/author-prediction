your
interests
in
the
church
more
architectural
or
historical?"
"Actually,
Sister,
my
interests
are
spiritual."
She
gave
a
pleasant
laugh.
"That
goes
without
saying.
I
simply
wondered
where
to
begin
your
tour."
Silas
felt
his
eyes
focus
on
the
altar.
"A
tour
is
unnecessary.
You
have
been
more
than
kind.
I
can
show
myself
around.
"It
is
no
trouble,"
she
said.
"After
all,
I
am
awake."
Silas
stopped
walking.
They
had
reached
the
front
pew
now,
and
the
altar
was
only
fifteen
yards
away.
He
turned
his
massive
body
fully
toward
the
small
woman,
and
he
could
sense
her
recoil
as
she
gazed
up
into
his
red
eyes.
"If
it
does
not
seem
too
rude,
Sister,
I
am
not
accustomed
to
simply
walking
into
a
house
of
God
and
taking
a
tour.
Would
you
mind
if
I
took
some
time
alone
to
pray
before
I
look
around?"
Sister
Sandrine
hesitated.
"Oh,
of
course.
I
shall
wait
in
the
rear
of
the
church
for
you."
Silas
put
a
soft
but
heavy
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
peered
down.
"Sister,
I
feel
guilty
already
for
having
awoken
you.
To
ask
you
to
stay
awake
is
too
much.
Please,
you
should
return
to
bed.
I
can
enjoy
your
sanctuary
and
then
let
myself
out."
She
looked
uneasy.
"Are
you
sure
you
won't
feel
abandoned?"
"Not
at
all.
Prayer
is
a
solitary
joy."
"As
you
wish."
Silas
took
his
hand
from
her
shoulder.
"Sleep
well,
Sister.
May
the
peace
of
the
Lord
be
with
you."
"And
also
with
you."
Sister
Sandrine
headed
for
the
stairs.
"Please
be
sure
the
door
closes
tightly
on
your
way
out."
"I
will
be
sure
of
it."
Silas
watched
her
climb
out
of
sight.
Then
he
turned
and
knelt
in
the
front
pew,
feeling
the
cilice
cut
into
his
leg.
Dear
God,
I
offer
up
to
you
this
work
I
do
today.
Crouching
in
the
shadows
of
the
choir
balcony
high
above
the
altar,
Sister
Sandrine
peered
silently
through
the
balustrade
at
the
cloaked
monk
kneeling
alone.
The
sudden
dread
in
her
soul
made
it
hard
to
stay
still.
For
a
fleeting
instant,
she
wondered
if
this
mysterious
visitor
could
be
the
enemy
they
had
warned
her
about,
and
if
tonight
she
would
have
to
carry
out
the
orders
she
had
been
holding
all
these
years.
She
decided
to
stay
there
in
the
darkness
and
watch
his
every
move.
Emerging
from
the
shadows,
Langdon
and
Sophie
moved
stealthily
up
the
deserted
Grand
Gallery
corridor
toward
the
emergency
exit
stairwell.
As
he
moved,
Langdon
felt
like
he
was
trying
to
assemble
a
jigsaw
puzzle
in
the
dark.
The
newest
aspect
of
this
mystery
was
a
deeply
troubling
one:
The
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
is
trying
to
frame
me
for
murder
"Do
you
think,"
he
whispered,
"that
maybe
Fache
wrote
that
message
on
the
floor?"
Sophie
didn't
even
turn.
"Impossible."
Langdon
wasn't
so
sure.
"He
seems
pretty
intent
on
making
me
look
guilty.
Maybe
he
thought
writing
my
name
on
