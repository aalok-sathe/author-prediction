only
to
the
hospital."
Teabing
rolled
his
eyes
at
Langdon
and
Sophie
and
grumbled,
"I
swear,
sometimes
it's
like
baby
sitting
a
child.
One
moment
please.
Help
yourself
to
a
drink
and
savory
snacks."
He
left
them,
clambering
awkwardly
toward
the
open
divider
to
talk
to
Remy.
Sophie
turned
to
Langdon
now,
her
voice
quiet.
"Robert,
nobody
knows
you
and
I
are
in
England."
Langdon
realized
she
was
right.
The
Kent
police
would
tell
Fache
the
plane
was
empty,
and
Fache
would
have
to
assume
they
were
still
in
France.
We
are
invisible.
Leigh's
little
stunt
had
just
bought
them
a
lot
of
time.
"Fache
will
not
give
up
easily,"
Sophie
said.
"He
has
too
much
riding
on
this
arrest
now."
Langdon
had
been
trying
not
to
think
about
Fache.
Sophie
had
promised
she
would
do
everything
in
her
power
to
exonerate
Langdon
once
this
was
over,
but
Langdon
was
starting
to
fear
it
might
not
matter.
Fache
could
easily
be
pan
of
this
plot.
Although
Langdon
could
not
imagine
the
Judicial
Police
tangled
up
in
the
Holy
Grail,
he
sensed
too
much
coincidence
tonight
to
disregard
Fache
as
a
possible
accomplice.
Fache
is
religions,
and
he
is
intent
on
pinning
these
murders
on
me.
Then
again,
Sophie
had
argued
that
Fache
might
simply
be
overzealous
to
make
the
arrest.
After
all,
the
evidence
against
Langdon
was
substantial.
In
addition
to
Langdon's
name
scrawled
on
the
Louvre
floor
and
in
Sauniere's
date
book,
Langdon
now
appeared
to
have
lied
about
his
manuscript
and
then
run
away.
At
Sophie
's
suggestion.
"Robert,
I'm
sorry
you're
so
deeply
involved,"
Sophie
said,
placing
her
hand
on
his
knee.
"But
I'm
very
glad
you're
here."
The
comment
sounded
more
pragmatic
than
romantic,
and
yet
Langdon
felt
an
unexpected
flicker
of
attraction
between
them.
He
gave
her
a
tired
smile.
"I'm
a
lot
more
fun
when
I've
slept."
Sophie
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"My
grandfather
asked
me
to
trust
you.
I'm
glad
I
listened
to
him
for
once."
"Your
grandfather
didn't
even
know
me."
"Even
so,
I
can't
help
but
think
you've
done
everything
he
would
have
wanted.
You
helped
me
find
the
keystone,
explained
the
Sangreal,
told
me
about
the
ritual
in
the
basement."
She
paused.
"Somehow
I
feel
closer
to
my
grandfather
tonight
than
I
have
in
years.
I
know
he
would
be
happy
about
that."
In
the
distance,
now,
the
skyline
of
London
began
to
materialize
through
the
dawn
drizzle.
Once
dominated
by
Big
Ben
and
Tower
Bridge,
the
horizon
now
bowed
to
the
Millennium
Eye
a
colossal,
ultramodern
Ferris
wheel
that
climbed
five
hundred
feet
and
afforded
breathtaking
views
of
the
city.
Langdon
had
attempted
to
board
it
once,
but
the
"viewing
capsules"
reminded
him
of
sealed
sarcophagi,
and
he
opted
to
keep
his
feet
on
the
ground
and
enjoy
the
view
from
the
airy
banks
of
the
Thames.
Langdon
felt
a
squeeze
on
his
knee,
pulling
him
back,
and
Sophie's
green
eyes
were
on
him.
He
realized
she
had
