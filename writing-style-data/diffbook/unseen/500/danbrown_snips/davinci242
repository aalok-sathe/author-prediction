"I
don't
see
any
docents,"
Sophie
said.
"Maybe
we
can
find
the
tomb
on
our
own?"
Without
a
word,
Langdon
led
her
another
few
steps
to
the
center
of
the
abbey
and
pointed
to
the
right.
Sophie
drew
a
startled
breath
as
she
looked
down
the
length
of
the
abbey's
nave,
the
full
magnitude
of
the
building
now
visible.
"Aah,"
she
said.
"Let's
find
a
docent."
At
that
moment,
a
hundred
yards
down
the
nave,
out
of
sight
behind
the
choir
screen,
the
stately
tomb
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton
had
a
lone
visitor.
The
Teacher
had
been
scrutinizing
the
monument
for
ten
minutes
now.
Newton's
tomb
consisted
of
a
massive
black
marble
sarcophagus
on
which
reclined
the
sculpted
form
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
wearing
classical
costume,
and
leaning
proudly
against
a
stack
of
his
own
books
Divinity,
Chronology,
Opticks,
and
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica.
At
Newton's
feet
stood
two
winged
boys
holding
a
scroll.
Behind
Newton's
recumbent
body
rose
an
austere
pyramid.
Although
the
pyramid
itself
seemed
an
oddity,
it
was
the
giant
shape
mounted
halfway
up
the
pyramid
that
most
intrigued
the
Teacher.
An
orb.
The
Teacher
pondered
Sauniere's
beguiling
riddle.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
The
massive
orb
protruding
from
the
face
of
the
pyramid
was
carved
in
basso
relievo
and
depicted
all
kinds
of
heavenly
bodies
constellations,
signs
of
the
zodiac,
comets,
stars,
and
planets.
Above
it,
the
image
of
the
Goddess
of
Astronomy
beneath
a
field
of
stars.
Countless
orbs.
The
Teacher
had
been
convinced
that
once
he
found
the
tomb,
discerning
the
missing
orb
would
be
easy.
Now
he
was
not
so
sure.
He
was
gazing
at
a
complicated
map
of
the
heavens.
Was
there
a
missing
planet?
Had
some
astronomical
orb
been
omitted
from
a
constellation?
He
had
no
idea.
Even
so,
the
Teacher
could
not
help
but
suspect
that
the
solution
would
be
ingeniously
clean
and
simple
"a
knight
a
pope
interred."
What
orb
am
I
looking
for?
Certainly,
an
advanced
knowledge
of
astrophysics
was
not
a
prerequisite
for
finding
the
Holy
Grail,
was
it?
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
The
Teacher's
concentration
was
broken
by
several
approaching
tourists.
He
slipped
the
cryptex
back
in
his
pocket
and
watched
warily
as
the
visitors
went
to
a
nearby
table,
left
a
donation
in
the
cup,
and
restocked
on
the
complimentary
grave
rubbing
supplies
set
out
by
the
abbey.
Armed
with
fresh
charcoal
pencils
and
large
sheets
of
heavy
paper,
they
headed
off
toward
the
front
of
the
abbey,
probably
to
the
popular
Poets'
Corner
to
pay
their
respects
to
Chaucer,
Tennyson,
and
Dickens
by
rubbing
furiously
on
their
graves.
Alone
again,
he
stepped
closer
to
the
tomb,
scanning
it
from
bottom
to
top.
He
began
with
the
clawed
feet
beneath
the
sarcophagus,
moved
upward
past
Newton,
past
his
books
on
science,
past
the
two
boys
with
their
mathematical
scroll,
up
the
face
of
the
pyramid
to
the
giant
orb
with
its
constellations,
and
finally
up
to
