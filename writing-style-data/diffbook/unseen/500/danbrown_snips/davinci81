felt
heavy
and
dangerously
foreign.
Taking
the
stairs
two
at
a
time,
Langdon
wondered
if
Sophie
had
any
idea
how
valuable
a
painting
she
had
almost
ruined.
Her
choice
in
art
seemed
eerily
pertinent
to
tonight's
adventure.
The
Da
Vinci
she
had
grabbed,
much
like
the
Mona
Lisa,
was
notorious
among
art
historians
for
its
plethora
of
hidden
pagan
symbolism.
"You
chose
a
valuable
hostage,"
he
said
as
they
ran.
"Madonna
of
the
Rocks,
"
she
replied.
"But
I
didn't
choose
it,
my
grandfather
did.
He
left
me
a
little
something
behind
the
painting."
Langdon
shot
her
a
startled
look.
"What!?
But
how
did
you
know
which
painting?
Why
Madonna
of
the
Rocks?"
"So
dark
the
con
of
man."
She
flashed
a
triumphant
smile.
"I
missed
the
first
two
anagrams,
Robert.
I
wasn't
about
to
miss
the
third."
"They're
dead!"
Sister
Sandrine
stammered
into
the
telephone
in
her
Saint
Sulpice
residence.
She
was
leaving
a
message
on
an
answering
machine.
"Please
pick
up!
They're
all
dead!"
The
first
three
phone
numbers
on
the
list
had
produced
terrifying
results
a
hysterical
widow,
a
detective
working
late
at
a
murder
scene,
and
a
somber
priest
consoling
a
bereaved
family.
All
three
contacts
were
dead.
And
now,
as
she
called
the
fourth
and
final
number
the
number
she
was
not
supposed
to
call
unless
the
first
three
could
not
be
reached
she
got
an
answering
machine.
The
outgoing
message
offered
no
name
but
simply
asked
the
caller
to
leave
a
message.
"The
floor
panel
has
been
broken!"
she
pleaded
as
she
left
the
message.
"The
other
three
are
dead!"
Sister
Sandrine
did
not
know
the
identities
of
the
four
men
she
protected,
but
the
private
phone
numbers
stashed
beneath
her
bed
were
for
use
on
only
one
condition.
If
that
floor
panel
is
ever
broken,
the
faceless
messenger
had
told
her,
it
means
the
upper
echelon
has
been
breached.
One
of
us
has
been
mortally
threatened
and
been
forced
to
tell
a
desperate
lie.
Call
the
numbers.
Warn
the
others.
Do
not
fail
us
in
this.
It
was
a
silent
alarm.
Foolproof
in
its
simplicity.
The
plan
had
amazed
her
when
she
first
heard
it.
If
the
identity
of
one
brother
was
compromised,
he
could
tell
a
lie
that
would
start
in
motion
a
mechanism
to
warn
the
others.
Tonight,
however,
it
seemed
that
more
than
one
had
been
compromised.
"Please
answer,"
she
whispered
in
fear.
"Where
are
you?"
"Hang
up
the
phone,"
a
deep
voice
said
from
the
doorway.
Turning
in
terror,
she
saw
the
massive
monk.
He
was
clutching
the
heavy
iron
candle
stand.
Shaking,
she
set
the
phone
back
in
the
cradle.
"They
are
dead,"
the
monk
said.
"All
four
of
them.
And
they
have
played
me
for
a
fool.
Tell
me
where
the
keystone
is."
"I
don't
know!"
Sister
Sandrine
said
truthfully.
"That
secret
is
guarded
by
others."
Others
who
are
dead!
The
man
advanced,
his
white
fists
gripping
the
iron
stand.
"You
are
a
sister
of
the
Church,
