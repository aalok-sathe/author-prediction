nowhere?"
"I
didn't
see
them."
"And
if
I
show
them
to
you,
will
you
get
some
sleep?"
Before
Langdon
could
answer,
Marie
Chauvel
had
stepped
off
the
porch
and
was
heading
toward
the
chapel.
Langdon
hurried
after
her.
Entering
the
ancient
building,
Marie
turned
on
the
lights
and
pointed
to
the
center
of
the
sanctuary
floor.
"There
you
are,
Mr.
Langdon.
The
blade
and
chalice."
Langdon
stared
at
the
scuffed
stone
floor.
It
was
blank.
"There's
nothing
here."
Marie
sighed
and
began
to
walk
along
the
famous
path
worn
into
the
chapel
floor,
the
same
path
Langdon
had
seen
the
visitors
walking
earlier
this
evening.
As
his
eyes
adjusted
to
see
the
giant
symbol,
he
still
felt
lost.
"But
that's
the
Star
of
Dav
Langdon
stopped
short,
mute
with
amazement
as
it
dawned
on
him.
The
blade
and
chalice.
Fused
as
one.
The
Star
of
David
the
perfect
union
of
male
and
female
Solomon's
Seal
marking
the
Holy
of
Holies,
where
the
male
and
female
deities
Yahweh
and
Shekinah
were
thought
to
dwell.
Langdon
needed
a
minute
to
find
his
words.
"The
verse
does
point
here
to
Rosslyn.
Completely.
Perfectly."
Marie
smiled.
"Apparently."
The
implications
chilled
him.
"So
the
Holy
Grail
is
in
the
vault
beneath
us?"
She
laughed.
"Only
in
spirit.
One
of
the
Priory's
most
ancient
charges
was
one
day
to
return
the
Grail
to
her
homeland
of
France
where
she
could
rest
for
eternity.
For
centuries,
she
was
dragged
across
the
countryside
to
keep
her
safe.
Most
undignified.
Jacques's
charge
when
he
became
Grand
Master
was
to
restore
her
honor
by
returning
her
to
France
and
building
her
a
resting
place
fit
for
a
queen."
"And
he
succeeded?"
Now
her
face
grew
serious.
"Mr.
Langdon,
considering
what
you've
done
for
me
tonight,
and
as
curator
of
the
Rosslyn
Trust,
I
can
tell
you
for
certain
that
the
Grail
is
no
longer
here."
Langdon
decided
to
press.
"But
the
keystone
is
supposed
to
point
to
the
place
where
the
Holy
Grail
is
hidden
now.
Why
does
it
point
to
Rosslyn?"
"Maybe
you're
misreading
its
meaning.
Remember,
the
Grail
can
be
deceptive.
As
could
my
late
husband."
"But
how
much
clearer
could
he
be?"
he
asked.
"We
are
standing
over
an
underground
vault
marked
by
the
blade
and
chalice,
underneath
a
ceiling
of
stars,
surrounded
by
the
art
of
Master
Masons.
Everything
speaks
of
Rosslyn."
"Very
well,
let
me
see
this
mysterious
verse."
She
unrolled
the
papyrus
and
read
the
poem
aloud
in
a
deliberate
tone.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
The
blade
and
chalice
guarding
o'er
Her
gates.
Adorned
in
masters'
loving
art,
She
lies.
She
rests
at
last
beneath
the
starry
skies.
When
she
finished,
she
was
still
for
several
seconds,
until
a
knowing
smile
crossed
her
lips.
"Aah,
Jacques."
Langdon
watched
her
expectantly.
"You
understand
this?"
"As
you
have
witnessed
on
the
chapel
floor,
Mr.
Langdon,
there
are
many
ways
to
see
simple
things."
Langdon
strained
to
understand.
Everything
about
Jacques
Sauniere
seemed
to
