powerful
magnetic
field
that
emanated
inexplicably
from
these
coordinates,
some
claimed
they
came
to
search
the
hillside
for
a
hidden
entrance
to
the
vault,
but
most
admitted
they
had
come
simply
to
wander
the
grounds
and
absorb
the
lore
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Although
Langdon
had
never
been
to
Rosslyn
before
now,
he
always
chuckled
when
he
heard
the
chapel
described
as
the
current
home
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Admittedly,
Rosslyn
once
might
have
been
home
to
the
Grail,
long
ago
but
certainly
no
longer.
Far
too
much
attention
had
been
drawn
to
Rosslyn
in
past
decades,
and
sooner
or
later
someone
would
find
a
way
to
break
into
the
vault.
True
Grail
academics
agreed
that
Rosslyn
was
a
decoy
one
of
the
devious
dead
ends
the
Priory
crafted
so
convincingly.
Tonight,
however,
with
the
Priory's
keystone
offering
a
verse
that
pointed
directly
to
this
spot,
Langdon
no
longer
felt
so
smug.
A
perplexing
question
had
been
running
through
his
mind
all
day:
Why
would
Sauniere
go
to
such
effort
to
guide
us
to
so
obvious
a
location?
There
seemed
only
one
logical
answer.
There
is
something
about
Rosslyn
we
have
yet
to
understand.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
standing
outside
the
car,
looking
back
at
him.
"Are
you
corning?"
She
was
holding
the
rosewood
box,
which
Captain
Fache
had
returned
to
them.
Inside,
both
cryptexes
had
been
reassembled
and
nested
as
they
had
been
found.
The
papyrus
verse
was
locked
safely
at
its
core
minus
the
shattered
vial
of
vinegar.
Making
their
way
up
the
long
gravel
path,
Langdon
and
Sophie
passed
the
famous
west
wall
of
the
chapel.
Casual
visitors
assumed
this
oddly
protruding
wall
was
a
section
of
the
chapel
that
had
not
been
finished.
The
truth,
Langdon
recalled,
was
far
more
intriguing.
The
west
wall
of
Solomon's
Temple.
The
Knights
Templar
had
designed
Rosslyn
Chapel
as
an
exact
architectural
blueprint
of
Solomon's
Temple
in
Jerusalem
complete
with
a
west
wall,
a
narrow
rectangular
sanctuary,
and
a
subterranean
vault
like
the
Holy
of
Holies,
in
which
the
original
nine
knights
had
first
unearthed
their
priceless
treasure.
Langdon
had
to
admit,
there
existed
an
intriguing
symmetry
in
the
idea
of
the
Templars
building
a
modern
Grail
repository
that
echoed
the
Grail's
original
hiding
place.
Rosslyn
Chapel's
entrance
was
more
modest
than
Langdon
expected.
The
small
wooden
door
had
two
iron
hinges
and
a
simple,
oak
sign.
ROSLIN
This
ancient
spelling,
Langdon
explained
to
Sophie,
derived
from
the
Rose
Line
meridian
on
which
the
chapel
sat;
or,
as
Grail
academics
preferred
to
believe,
from
the
"Line
of
Rose"
the
ancestral
lineage
of
Mary
Magdalene.
The
chapel
would
be
closing
soon,
and
as
Langdon
pulled
open
the
door,
a
warm
puff
of
air
escaped,
as
if
the
ancient
edifice
were
heaving
a
weary
sigh
at
the
end
of
a
long
day.
Her
entry
arches
burgeoned
with
carved
cinquefoils.
Roses.
The
womb
of
the
goddess.
Entering
with
Sophie,
Langdon
felt
his
eyes
reaching
across
the
famous
sanctuary
and
taking
it
all
in.
Although
