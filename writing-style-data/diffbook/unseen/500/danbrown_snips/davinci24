a
mere
twenty
years.
Sister
Sandrine
could
not
help
but
feel
that
Opus
Dei's
good
standing
in
Rome
was
suspect,
but
one
did
not
argue
with
the
Holy
See.
"Bishop
Aringarosa
called
to
ask
me
a
favor,"
the
abbe
told
her,
his
voice
nervous.
"One
of
his
numeraries
is
in
Paris
tonight."
As
Sister
Sandrine
listened
to
the
odd
request,
she
felt
a
deepening
confusion.
"I'm
sorry,
you
say
this
visiting
Opus
Dei
numerary
cannot
wait
until
morning?"
"I'm
afraid
not.
His
plane
leaves
very
early.
He
has
always
dreamed
of
seeing
Saint
Sulpice."
"But
the
church
is
far
more
interesting
by
day.
The
sun's
rays
through
the
oculus,
the
graduated
shadows
on
the
gnomon,
this
is
what
makes
Saint
Sulpice
unique."
"Sister,
I
agree,
and
yet
I
would
consider
it
a
personal
favor
if
you
could
let
him
in
tonight.
He
can
be
there
at
say
one
o'clock?
That's
in
twenty
minutes."
Sister
Sandrine
frowned.
"Of
course.
It
would
be
my
pleasure."
The
abbe
thanked
her
and
hung
up.
Puzzled,
Sister
Sandrine
remained
a
moment
in
the
warmth
of
her
bed,
trying
to
shake
off
the
cobwebs
of
sleep.
Her
sixty
year
old
body
did
not
awake
as
fast
as
it
used
to,
although
tonight's
phone
call
had
certainly
roused
her
senses.
Opus
Dei
had
always
made
her
uneasy.
Beyond
the
prelature's
adherence
to
the
arcane
ritual
of
corporal
mortification,
their
views
on
women
were
medieval
at
best.
She
had
been
shocked
to
learn
that
female
numeraries
were
forced
to
clean
the
men's
residence
halls
for
no
pay
while
the
men
were
at
mass;
women
slept
on
hardwood
floors,
while
the
men
had
straw
mats;
and
women
were
forced
to
endure
additional
requirements
of
corporal
mortification
all
as
added
penance
for
original
sin.
It
seemed
Eve's
bite
from
the
apple
of
knowledge
was
a
debt
women
were
doomed
to
pay
for
eternity.
Sadly,
while
most
of
the
Catholic
Church
was
gradually
moving
in
the
right
direction
with
respect
to
women's
rights,
Opus
Dei
threatened
to
reverse
the
progress.
Even
so,
Sister
Sandrine
had
her
orders.
Swinging
her
legs
off
the
bed,
she
stood
slowly,
chilled
by
the
cold
stone
on
the
soles
of
her
bare
feet.
As
the
chill
rose
through
her
flesh,
she
felt
an
unexpected
apprehension.
Women's
intuition?
A
follower
of
God,
Sister
Sandrine
had
learned
to
find
peace
in
the
calming
voices
of
her
own
soul.
Tonight,
however,
those
voices
were
as
silent
as
the
empty
church
around
her.
Langdon
couldn't
tear
his
eyes
from
the
glowing
purple
text
scrawled
across
the
parquet
floor.
Jacques
Sauniere's
final
communication
seemed
as
unlikely
a
departing
message
as
any
Langdon
could
imagine.
The
message
read:

O,
Draconian
devil
!
Oh,
lame
saint!
Although
Langdon
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
it
meant,
he
did
understand
Fache's
instinct
that
the
pentacle
had
something
to
do
with
devil
worship.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Sauniere
had
left
a
literal
reference
to
the
devil.
Equally
