the
book
that
arguably
could
be
called
the
most
blood
soaked
publication
in
human
history.
Malleus
Maleficarum
or
The
Witches'
Hammer
indoctrinated
the
world
to
"the
dangers
of
freethinking
women"
and
instructed
the
clergy
how
to
locate,
torture,
and
destroy
them.
Those
deemed
"witches"
by
the
Church
included
all
female
scholars,
priestesses,
gypsies,
mystics,
nature
lovers,
herb
gatherers,
and
any
women
"suspiciously
attuned
to
the
natural
world.
"
Midwives
also
were
killed
for
their
heretical
practice
of
using
medical
knowledge
to
ease
the
pain
of
childbirth
a
suffering,
the
Church
claimed,
that
was
God's
rightful
punishment
for
Eve's
partaking
of
the
Apple
of
Knowledge,
thus
giving
birth
to
the
idea
of
Original
Sin.
During
three
hundred
years
of
witch
hunts,
the
Church
burned
at
the
stake
an
astounding
five
million
women.
The
propaganda
and
bloodshed
had
worked.
Today's
world
was
living
proof.
Women,
once
celebrated
as
an
essential
half
of
spiritual
enlightenment,
had
been
banished
from
the
temples
of
the
world.
There
were
no
female
Orthodox
rabbis,
Catholic
priests,
nor
Islamic
clerics.
The
once
hallowed
act
of
Hieros
Gamos
the
natural
sexual
union
between
man
and
woman
through
which
each
became
spiritually
whole
had
been
recast
as
a
shameful
act.
Holy
men
who
had
once
required
sexual
union
with
their
female
counterparts
to
commune
with
God
now
feared
their
natural
sexual
urges
as
the
work
of
the
devil,
collaborating
with
his
favorite
accomplice
woman.
Not
even
the
feminine
association
with
the
left
hand
side
could
escape
the
Church's
defamation.
In
France
and
Italy,
the
words
for
"left"
gauche
and
sinistra
came
to
have
deeply
negative
overtones,
while
their
right
hand
counterparts
rang
of
ngz?eousness,
dexterity,
and
correctness.
To
this
day,
radical
thought
was
considered
left
wing,
irrational
thought
was
left
brain,
and
anything
evil,
sinister.
The
days
of
the
goddess
were
over.
The
pendulum
had
swung.
Mother
Earth
had
become
a
man's
world,
and
the
gods
of
destruction
and
war
were
taking
their
toll.
The
male
ego
had
spent
two
millennia
running
unchecked
by
its
female
counterpart.
The
Priory
of
Sion
believed
that
it
was
this
obliteration
of
the
sacred
feminine
in
modern
life
that
had
caused
what
the
Hopi
Native
Americans
called
koyanisquatsi
"life
out
of
balance"
an
unstable
situation
marked
by
testosterone
fueled
wars,
a
plethora
of
misogynistic
societies,
and
a
growing
disrespect
for
Mother
Earth.
"Robert!"
Sophie
said,
her
whisper
yanking
him
back.
"Someone's
coming!"
He
heard
the
approaching
footsteps
out
in
the
hallway.
"Over
here!"
Sophie
extinguished
the
black
light
and
seemed
to
evaporate
before
Langdon's
eyes.
For
an
instant
he
felt
totally
blind.
Over
where!
As
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
Sophie's
silhouette
racing
toward
the
center
of
the
room
and
ducking
out
of
sight
behind
the
octagonal
viewing
bench.
He
was
about
to
dash
after
her
when
a
booming
voice
stopped
him
cold.
"Arretez!"
a
man
commanded
from
the
doorway.
The
Louvre
security
agent
advanced
through
the
entrance
to
the
Salle
des
Etats,
his
pistol
outstretched,
taking
deadly
aim
at
Langdon's
chest.
Langdon
felt
