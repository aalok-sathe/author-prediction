In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
When
Sophie
arrived
at
the
second
group
of
knights,
she
found
that
this
second
group
was
similar
to
the
first.
All
lay
with
varied
body
positions,
wearing
armor
and
swords.
That
was,
all
except
the
tenth
and
final
tomb.
Hurrying
over
to
it,
she
stared
down.
No
pillow.
No
armor.
No
tunic.
No
sword.
"Robert?
Leigh?"
she
called,
her
voice
echoing
around
the
chamber.
"There's
something
missing
over
here."
Both
men
looked
up
and
immediately
began
to
cross
the
room
toward
her.
"An
orb?"
Teabing
called
excitedly.
His
crutches
clicked
out
a
rapid
staccato
as
he
hurried
across
the
room.
"Are
we
missing
an
orb?"
"Not
exactly,"
Sophie
said,
frowning
at
the
tenth
tomb.
"We
seem
to
be
missing
an
entire
knight."
Arriving
beside
her
both
men
gazed
down
in
confusion
at
the
tenth
tomb.
Rather
than
a
knight
lying
in
the
open
air,
this
tomb
was
a
sealed
stone
casket.
The
casket
was
trapezoidal,
tapered
at
the
feet,
widening
toward
the
top,
with
a
peaked
lid.
"Why
isn't
this
knight
shown?"
Langdon
asked.
"Fascinating,"
Teabing
said,
stroking
his
chin.
"I
had
forgotten
about
this
oddity.
It's
been
years
since
I
was
here."
"This
coffin,"
Sophie
said,
"looks
like
it
was
carved
at
the
same
time
and
by
the
same
sculptor
as
the
other
nine
tombs.
So
why
is
this
knight
in
a
casket
rather
than
in
the
open?"
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"One
of
this
church's
mysteries.
To
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
nobody
has
ever
found
any
explanation
for
it.
"Hello?"
the
altar
boy
said,
arriving
with
a
perturbed
look
on
his
face.
"Forgive
me
if
this
seems
rude,
but
you
told
me
you
wanted
to
spread
ashes,
and
yet
you
seem
to
be
sightseeing."
Teabing
scowled
at
the
boy
and
turned
to
Langdon.
"Mr.
Wren,
apparently
your
family's
philanthropy
does
not
buy
you
the
time
it
used
to,
so
perhaps
we
should
take
out
the
ashes
and
get
on
with
it."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie.
"Mrs.
Wren?"
Sophie
played
along,
pulling
the
vellumwrapped
cryptex
from
her
pocket.
"Now
then,"
Teabing
snapped
at
the
boy,
"if
you
would
give
us
some
privacy?"
The
altar
boy
did
not
move.
He
was
eyeing
Langdon
closely
now.
"You
look
familiar."
Teabing
huffed.
"Perhaps
that
is
because
Mr.
Wren
comes
here
every
year!"
Or
perhaps,
Sophie
now
feared,
because
he
saw
Langdon
on
television
at
the
Vatican
last
year.
"I
have
never
met
Mr.
Wren,"
the
altar
boy
declared.
"You're
mistaken,"
Langdon
said
politely.
"I
believe
you
and
I
met
in
passing
last
year.
Father
Knowles
failed
to
formally
introduce
us,
but
I
recognized
your
face
as
we
came
in.
Now,
I
realize
this
is
an
intrusion,
but
if
you
could
afford
me
a
few
more
minutes,
I
have
traveled
a
great
distance
to
scatter
ashes
amongst
these
tombs."
