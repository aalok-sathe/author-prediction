New
York,
he
stared
out
at
the
skyline
in
disillusionment
for
days,
overwhelmed
with
sadness
for
the
future
of
Christianity.
It
was
several
weeks
later
that
he
received
the
phone
call
that
changed
all
that.
The
caller
sounded
French
and
identified
himself
as
the
Teacher
a
title
common
in
the
prelature.
He
said
he
knew
of
the
Vatican's
plans
to
pull
support
from
Opus
Dei.
How
could
he
know
that?
Aringarosa
wondered.
He
had
hoped
only
a
handful
of
Vatican
power
brokers
knew
of
Opus
Dei's
impending
annulment.
Apparently
the
word
was
out.
When
it
came
to
containing
gossip,
no
walls
in
the
world
were
as
porous
as
those
surrounding
Vatican
City.
"I
have
ears
everywhere,
Bishop,"
the
Teacher
whispered,
"and
with
these
ears
I
have
gained
certain
knowledge.
With
your
help,
I
can
uncover
the
hiding
place
of
a
sacred
relic
that
will
bring
you
enormous
power
enough
power
to
make
the
Vatican
bow
before
you.
Enough
power
to
save
the
Faith."
He
paused.
"Not
just
for
Opus
Dei.
But
for
all
of
us."
The
Lord
taketh
away
and
the
Lord
giveth.
Aringarosa
felt
a
glorious
ray
of
hope.
"Tell
me
your
plan."
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
unconscious
when
the
doors
of
St.
Mary's
Hospital
hissed
open.
Silas
lurched
into
the
entryway
delirious
with
exhaustion.
Dropping
to
his
knees
on
the
tile
floor,
he
cried
out
for
help.
Everyone
in
the
reception
area
gaped
in
wonderment
at
the
half
naked
albino
offering
forth
a
bleeding
clergyman.
The
doctor
who
helped
Silas
heave
the
delirious
bishop
onto
a
gurney
looked
gloomy
as
he
felt
Aringarosa's
pulse.
"He's
lost
a
lot
of
blood.
I
am
not
hopeful."
Aringarosa's
eyes
flickered,
and
he
returned
for
a
moment,
his
gaze
locating
Silas.
"My
child"
Silas's
soul
thundered
with
remorse
and
rage.
"Father,
if
it
takes
my
lifetime,
I
will
find
the
one
who
deceived
us,
and
I
will
kill
him."
Aringarosa
shook
his
head,
looking
sad
as
they
prepared
to
wheel
him
away.
"Silas
if
you
have
learned
nothing
from
me,
please
learn
this."
He
took
Silas's
hand
and
gave
it
a
firm
squeeze.
"Forgiveness
is
God's
greatest
gift."
"But
Father"
Aringarosa
closed
his
eyes.
"Silas,
you
must
pray."
Robert
Langdon
stood
beneath
the
lofty
cupola
of
the
deserted
Chapter
House
and
stared
into
the
barrel
of
Leigh
Teabing's
gun.
Robert,
are
you
with
me,
or
against
me?
The
Royal
Historian's
words
echoed
in
the
silence
of
Langdon's
mind.
There
was
no
viable
response,
Langdon
knew.
Answer
yes,
and
he
would
be
selling
out
Sophie.
Answer
no,
and
Teabing
would
have
no
choice
but
to
kill
them
both.
Langdon's
years
in
the
classroom
had
not
imbued
him
with
any
skills
relevant
to
handling
confrontations
at
gunpoint,
but
the
classroom
had
taught
him
something
about
answering
paradoxical
questions.
When
a
question
has
no
correct
answer,
there
is
only
one
honest
response.
The
gray
area
between
yes
and
no.
Silence.
Staring
at
the
cryptex
in
his
hands,
Langdon
chose
simply
to
walk
away.
Without
ever
lifting
