to
a
powerful
young
man.
When
people
passed
by,
he
could
hear
them
whispering
to
one
another.
A
ghost,
they
would
say,
their
eyes
wide
with
fright
as
they
stared
at
his
white
skin.
A
ghost
with
the
eyes
of
a
devil!
And
he
felt
like
a
ghost
transparent
floating
from
seaport
to
seaport.
People
seemed
to
look
right
through
him.
At
eighteen,
in
a
port
town,
while
attempting
to
steal
a
case
of
cured
ham
from
a
cargo
ship,
he
was
caught
by
a
pair
of
crewmen.
The
two
sailors
who
began
to
beat
him
smelled
of
beer,
just
as
his
father
had.
The
memories
of
fear
and
hatred
surfaced
like
a
monster
from
the
deep.
The
young
man
broke
the
first
sailor's
neck
with
his
bare
hands,
and
only
the
arrival
of
the
police
saved
the
second
sailor
from
a
similar
fate.
Two
months
later,
in
shackles,
he
arrived
at
a
prison
in
Andorra.
You
are
as
white
as
a
ghost,
the
inmates
ridiculed
as
the
guards
marched
him
in,
naked
and
cold.
Mira
el
espectro!
Perhaps
the
ghost
will
pass
right
through
these
walls!
Over
the
course
of
twelve
years,
his
flesh
and
soul
withered
until
he
knew
he
had
become
transparent.
am
a
ghost.
I
am
weightless.
Yo
soy
un
espectro
palido
coma
unafantasma
caminando
este
mundo
a
solas.
One
night
the
ghost
awoke
to
the
screams
of
other
inmates.
He
didn't
know
what
invisible
force
was
shaking
the
floor
on
which
he
slept,
nor
what
mighty
hand
was
trembling
the
mortar
of
his
stone
cell,
but
as
he
jumped
to
his
feet,
a
large
boulder
toppled
onto
the
very
spot
where
he
had
been
sleeping.
Looking
up
to
see
where
the
stone
had
come
from,
he
saw
a
hole
in
the
trembling
wall,
and
beyond
it,
a
vision
he
had
not
seen
in
over
ten
years.
The
moon.
Even
while
the
earth
still
shook,
the
ghost
found
himself
scrambling
through
a
narrow
tunnel,
staggering
out
into
an
expansive
vista,
and
tumbling
down
a
barren
mountainside
into
the
woods.
He
ran
all
night,
always
downward,
delirious
with
hunger
and
exhaustion.
Skirting
the
edges
of
consciousness,
he
found
himself
at
dawn
in
a
clearing
where
train
tracks
cut
a
swath
across
the
forest.
Following
the
rails,
he
moved
on
as
if
dreaming.
Seeing
an
empty
freight
car,
he
crawled
in
for
shelter
and
rest.
When
he
awoke
the
train
was
moving.
How
long?
How
far?
A
pain
was
growing
in
his
gut.
Am
I
dying
?
He
slept
again.
This
time
he
awoke
to
someone
yelling,
beating
him,
throwing
him
out
of
the
freight
car.
Bloody,
he
wandered
the
outskirts
of
a
small
village
looking
in
vain
for
food.
Finally,
his
body
too
weak
to
take
another
step,
he
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
slipped
into
unconsciousness.
The
light
came
slowly,
and
the
ghost
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
dead.
A
day?
Three
days?
It
didn't
matter.
His
bed
was
soft
like
