dinner,
Teabing
had
suggested.
Sauniere
apparently
had
done
just
that
and
left
the
knight
unattended
long
enough
for
Remy
Legaludec
to
make
one
inconspicuous
addition.
Now,
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
cab,
Fache
closed
his
eyes.
One
more
thing
to
attend
to
before
I
return
to
Paris.
The
St.
Mary's
Hospital
recovery
room
was
sunny.
"You've
impressed
us
all,"
the
nurse
said,
smiling
down
at
him.
"Nothing
short
of
miraculous."
Bishop
Aringarosa
gave
a
weak
smile.
"I
have
always
been
blessed."
The
nurse
finished
puttering,
leaving
the
bishop
alone.
The
sunlight
felt
welcome
and
warm
on
his
face.
Last
night
had
been
the
darkest
night
of
his
life.
Despondently,
he
thought
of
Silas,
whose
body
had
been
found
in
the
park.
Please
forgive
me,
my
son.
Aringarosa
had
longed
for
Silas
to
be
part
of
his
glorious
plan.
Last
night,
however,
Aringarosa
had
received
a
call
from
Bezu
Fache,
questioning
the
bishop
about
his
apparent
connection
to
a
nun
who
had
been
murdered
in
Saint
Sulpice.
Aringarosa
realized
the
evening
had
taken
a
horrifying
turn.
News
of
the
four
additional
murders
transformed
his
horror
to
anguish.
Silas,
what
have
you
done!
Unable
to
reach
the
Teacher,
the
bishop
knew
he
had
been
cut
loose.
Used.
The
only
way
to
stop
the
horrific
chain
of
events
he
had
helped
put
in
motion
was
to
confess
everything
to
Fache,
and
from
that
moment
on,
Aringarosa
and
Fache
had
been
racing
to
catch
up
with
Silas
before
the
Teacher
persuaded
him
to
kill
again.
Feeling
bone
weary,
Aringarosa
closed
his
eyes
and
listened
to
the
television
coverage
of
the
arrest
of
a
prominent
British
knight,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
The
Teacher
laid
bare
for
all
to
see.
Teabing
had
caught
wind
of
the
Vatican's
plans
to
disassociate
itself
from
Opus
Dei.
He
had
chosen
Aringarosa
as
the
perfect
pawn
in
his
plan.
After
all,
who
more
likely
to
leap
blindly
after
the
Holy
Grail
than
a
man
like
myself
with
everything
to
lose?
The
Grail
would
have
brought
enormous
power
to
anyone
who
possessed
it.
Leigh
Teabing
had
protected
his
identity
shrewdly
feigning
a
French
accent
and
a
pious
heart,
and
demanding
as
payment
the
one
thing
he
did
not
need
money.
Aringarosa
had
been
far
too
eager
to
be
suspicious.
The
price
tag
of
twenty
million
euro
was
paltry
when
compared
with
the
prize
of
obtaining
the
Grail,
and
with
the
Vatican's
separation
payment
to
Opus
Dei,
the
finances
had
worked
nicely.
The
blind
see
what
they
want
to
see.
Teabing's
ultimate
insult,
of
course,
had
been
to
demand
payment
in
Vatican
bonds,
such
that
if
anything
went
wrong,
the
investigation
would
lead
to
Rome.
"I
am
glad
to
see
you're
well,
My
Lord."
Aringarosa
recognized
the
gruff
voice
in
the
doorway,
but
the
face
was
unexpected
stern,
powerful
features,
slicked
back
hair,
and
a
broad
neck
that
strained
against
his
dark
suit.
"Captain
Fache?"
Aringarosa
asked.
The
compassion
and
concern
the
captain
had
shown
for
Aringarosa's
plight
last
night
had
conjured
