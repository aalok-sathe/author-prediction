the
Grail
should
be
unveiled.
In
fact
the
Priory
has
always
maintained
that
the
Grail
should
never
be
unveiled."
"Never?"
Langdon
was
stunned.
"It
is
the
mystery
and
wonderment
that
serve
our
souls,
not
the
Grail
itself.
The
beauty
of
the
Grail
lies
in
her
ethereal
nature."
Marie
Chauvel
gazed
up
at
Rosslyn
now.
"For
some,
the
Grail
is
a
chalice
that
will
bring
them
everlasting
life.
For
others,
it
is
the
quest
for
lost
documents
and
secret
history.
And
for
most,
I
suspect
the
Holy
Grail
is
simply
a
grand
idea
a
glorious
unattainable
treasure
that
somehow,
even
in
today's
world
of
chaos,
inspires
us."
"But
if
the
Sangreal
documents
remain
hidden,
the
story
of
Mary
Magdalene
will
be
lost
forever,"
Langdon
said.
"Will
it?
Look
around
you.
Her
story
is
being
told
in
art,
music,
and
books.
More
so
every
day.
The
pendulum
is
swinging.
We
are
starting
to
sense
the
dangers
of
our
history
and
of
our
destructive
paths.
We
are
beginning
to
sense
the
need
to
restore
the
sacred
feminine."
She
paused.
"You
mentioned
you
are
writing
a
manuscript
about
the
symbols
of
the
sacred
feminine,
are
you
not?"
"I
am."
She
smiled.
"Finish
it,
Mr.
Langdon.
Sing
her
song.
The
world
needs
modern
troubadours."
Langdon
fell
silent,
feeling
the
weight
of
her
message
upon
him.
Across
the
open
spaces,
a
new
moon
was
rising
above
the
tree
line.
Turning
his
eyes
toward
Rosslyn,
Langdon
felt
a
boyish
craving
to
know
her
secrets.
Don't
ask,
he
told
himself.
This
is
not
the
moment.
He
glanced
at
the
papyrus
in
Marie's
hand,
and
then
back
at
Rosslyn.
"Ask
the
question,
Mr.
Langdon,"
Marie
said,
looking
amused.
"You
have
earned
the
right."
Langdon
felt
himself
flush.
"You
want
to
know
if
the
Grail
is
here
at
Rosslyn."
"Can
you
tell
me?"
She
sighed
in
mock
exasperation.
"Why
is
it
that
men
simply
cannot
let
the
Grail
rest?"
She
laughed,
obviously
enjoying
herself.
"Why
do
you
think
it's
here?"
Langdon
motioned
to
the
papyrus
in
her
hand.
"Your
husband's
poem
speaks
specifically
of
Rosslyn,
except
it
also
mentions
a
blade
and
chalice
watching
over
the
Grail.
I
didn't
see
any
symbols
of
the
blade
and
chalice
up
there."
"The
blade
and
chalice?"
Marie
asked.
"What
exactly
do
they
look
like?"
Langdon
sensed
she
was
toying
with
him,
but
he
played
along,
quickly
describing
the
symbols.
A
look
of
vague
recollection
crossed
her
face.
"Ah,
yes,
of
course.
The
blade
represents
all
that
is
masculine.
I
believe
it
is
drawn
like
this,
no?"
Using
her
index
finger,
she
traced
a
shape
on
her
palm.
A
"Yes,"
Langdon
said.
Marie
had
drawn
the
less
common
"closed"
form
of
the
blade,
although
Langdon
had
seen
the
symbol
portrayed
both
ways.
"And
the
inverse,"
she
said,
drawing
again
on
her
palm,
"is
the
chalice,
which
represents
the
feminine."
v
"Correct,"
Langdon
said.
"And
you
are
saying
that
in
all
the
hundreds
of
symbols
we
have
here
in
Rosslyn
Chapel,
these
two
shapes
appear
