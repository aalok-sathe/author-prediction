an
admonishing
glare.
"And
frankly,
sir,
considering
your
allegiance
to
the
Crown,
I'm
a
little
surprised
you
didn't
recognize
it."
In
a
flash,
Langdon
knew.
No
wonder
the
script
looks
so
damned
familiar!
Several
years
ago,
Langdon
had
attended
an
event
at
Harvard's
Fogg
Museum.
Harvard
dropout
Bill
Gates
had
returned
to
his
alma
mater
to
lend
to
the
museum
one
of
his
priceless
acquisitions
eighteen
sheets
of
paper
he
had
recently
purchased
at
auction
from
the
Armand
Hammar
Estate.
His
winning
bid
a
cool
$30.8
million.
The
author
of
the
pages
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
The
eighteen
folios
now
known
as
Leonardo's
Codex
Leicester
after
their
famous
owner,
the
Earl
of
Leicester
were
all
that
remained
of
one
of
Leonardo's
most
fascinating
notebooks:
essays
and
drawings
outlining
Da
Vinci's
progressive
theories
on
astronomy,
geology,
archaeology,
and
hydrology.
Langdon
would
never
forget
his
reaction
after
waiting
in
line
and
finally
viewing
the
priceless
parchment.
Utter
letdown.
The
pages
were
unintelligible.
Despite
being
beautifully
preserved
and
written
in
an
impeccably
neat
penmanship
crimson
ink
on
cream
paper
the
codex
looked
like
gibberish.
At
first
Langdon
thought
he
could
not
read
them
because
Da
Vinci
wrote
his
notebooks
in
an
archaic
Italian.
But
after
studying
them
more
closely,
he
realized
he
could
not
identify
a
single
Italian
word,
or
even
one
letter.
"Try
this,
sir,"
whispered
the
female
docent
at
the
display
case.
She
motioned
to
a
hand
mirror
affixed
to
the
display
on
a
chain.
Langdon
picked
it
up
and
examined
the
text
in
the
mirror's
surface.
Instantly
it
was
clear.
Langdon
had
been
so
eager
to
peruse
some
of
the
great
thinker's
ideas
that
he
had
forgotten
one
of
the
man's
numerous
artistic
talents
was
an
ability
to
write
in
a
mirrored
script
that
was
virtually
illegible
to
anyone
other
than
himself.
Historians
still
debated
whether
Da
Vinci
wrote
this
way
simply
to
amuse
himself
or
to
keep
people
from
peering
over
his
shoulder
and
stealing
his
ideas,
but
the
point
was
moot.
Da
Vinci
did
as
he
pleased.
Sophie
smiled
inwardly
to
see
that
Robert
understood
her
meaning.
"I
can
read
the
first
few
words,"
she
said.
"It's
English."
Teabing
was
still
sputtering.
"What's
going
on?"
"Reverse
text,"
Langdon
said.
"We
need
a
mirror."
"No
we
don't,"
Sophie
said.
"I
bet
this
veneer
is
thin
enough."
She
lifted
the
rosewood
box
up
to
a
canister
light
on
the
wall
and
began
examining
the
underside
of
the
lid.
Her
grandfather
couldn't
actually
write
in
reverse,
so
he
always
cheated
by
writing
normally
and
then
flipping
the
paper
over
and
tracing
the
reversed
impression.
Sophie's
guess
was
that
he
had
wood
burned
normal
text
into
a
block
of
wood
and
then
run
the
back
of
the
block
through
a
sander
until
the
wood
was
paper
thin
and
the
wood
burning
could
be
seen
through
the
wood.
Then
he'd
simply
flipped
the
piece
over,
and
laid
it
in.
As
Sophie
moved
the
lid
closer
to
the
light,
she
saw
she
was
right.
The
