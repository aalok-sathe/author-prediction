they
were
all
astounded.
He
felt
a
familiar
warmth
inside.
This
is
why
he
taught.
"My
friends,
as
you
can
see,
the
chaos
of
the
world
has
an
underlying
order.
When
the
ancients
discovered
PHI,
they
were
certain
they
had
stumbled
across
God's
building
block
for
the
world,
and
they
worshipped
Nature
because
of
that.
And
one
can
understand
why.
God's
hand
is
evident
in
Nature,
and
even
to
this
day
there
exist
pagan,
Mother
Earth
revering
religions.
Many
of
us
celebrate
nature
the
way
the
pagans
did,
and
don't
even
know
it.
May
Day
is
a
perfect
example,
the
celebration
of
spring
the
earth
coming
back
to
life
to
produce
her
bounty.
The
mysterious
magic
inherent
in
the
Divine
Proportion
was
written
at
the
beginning
of
time.
Man
is
simply
playing
by
Nature's
rules,
and
because
art
is
man's
attempt
to
imitate
the
beauty
of
the
Creator's
hand,
you
can
imagine
we
might
be
seeing
a
lot
of
instances
of
the
Divine
Proportion
in
art
this
semester."
Over
the
next
half
hour,
Langdon
showed
them
slides
of
artwork
by
Michelangelo,
Albrecht
Diirer,
Da
Vinci,
and
many
others,
demonstrating
each
artist's
intentional
and
rigorous
adherence
to
the
Divine
Proportion
in
the
layout
of
his
compositions.
Langdon
unveiled
PHI
in
the
architectural
dimensions
of
the
Greek
Parthenon,
the
pyramids
of
Egypt,
and
even
the
United
Nations
Building
in
New
York.
PHI
appeared
in
the
organizational
structures
of
Mozart's
sonatas,
Beethoven's
Fifth
Symphony,
as
well
as
the
works
of
Bartok,
Debussy,
and
Schubert.
The
number
PHI,
Langdon
told
them,
was
even
used
by
Stradivarius
to
calculate
the
exact
placement
of
the
f
holes
in
the
construction
of
his
famous
violins.
"In
closing,"
Langdon
said,
walking
to
the
chalkboard,
"we
return
to
symbols"
He
drew
five
intersecting
lines
that
formed
a
five
pointed
star.
"This
symbol
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
images
you
will
see
this
term.
Formally
known
as
a
pentagram
or
pentacle,
as
the
ancients
called
it
this
symbol
is
considered
both
divine
and
magical
by
many
cultures.
Can
anyone
tell
me
why
that
might
be?"
Stettner,
the
math
major,
raised
his
hand.
"Because
if
you
draw
a
pentagram,
the
lines
automatically
divide
themselves
into
segments
according
to
the
Divine
Proportion."
Langdon
gave
the
kid
a
proud
nod.
"Nice
job.
Yes,
the
ratios
of
line
segments
in
a
pentacle
all
equal
PHI,
making
this
symbol
the
ultimate
expression
of
the
Divine
Proportion.
For
this
reason,
the
five
pointed
star
has
always
been
the
symbol
for
beauty
and
perfection
associated
with
the
goddess
and
the
sacred
feminine."
The
girls
in
class
beamed.
"One
note,
folks.
We've
only
touched
on
Da
Vinci
today,
but
we'll
be
seeing
a
lot
more
of
him
this
semester.
Leonardo
was
a
well
documented
devotee
of
the
ancient
ways
of
the
goddess.
Tomorrow,
I'll
show
you
his
fresco
The
Last
Supper,
which
is
one
of
the
most
astonishing
tributes
to
the
sacred
feminine
you
will
ever
see."
"You're
kidding,
right?"
somebody
said.
"I
