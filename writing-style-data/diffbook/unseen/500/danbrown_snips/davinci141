at
your
service.
What
is
it
I
can
tell
you?"
Langdon
sighed.
"I
was
hoping
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
explain
to
Ms.
Neveu
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Teabing
looked
stunned.
"She
doesn't
know?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
The
smile
that
grew
on
Teabing's
face
was
almost
obscene.
"Robert,
you've
brought
me
a
virgin?"
Langdon
winced,
glancing
at
Sophie.
"Virgin
is
the
term
Grail
enthusiasts
use
to
describe
anyone
who
has
never
heard
the
true
Grail
story."
Teabing
turned
eagerly
to
Sophie.
"How
much
do
you
know,
my
dear?"
Sophie
quickly
outlined
what
Langdon
had
explained
earlier
the
Priory
of
Sion,
the
Knights
Templar,
the
Sangreal
documents,
and
the
Holy
Grail,
which
many
claimed
was
not
a
cup
but
rather
something
far
more
powerful.
"That's
all?"
Teabing
fired
Langdon
a
scandalous
look.
"Robert,
I
thought
you
were
a
gentleman.
You've
robbed
her
of
the
climax!"
"I
know,
I
thought
perhaps
you
and
I
could"
Langdon
apparently
decided
the
unseemly
metaphor
had
gone
far
enough.
Teabing
already
had
Sophie
locked
in
his
twinkling
gaze.
"You
are
a
Grail
virgin,
my
dear.
And
trust
me,
you
will
never
forget
your
first
time."
Seated
on
the
divan
beside
Langdon,
Sophie
drank
her
tea
and
ate
a
scone,
feeling
the
welcome
effects
of
caffeine
and
food.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
was
beaming
as
he
awkwardly
paced
before
the
open
fire,
his
leg
braces
clicking
on
the
stone
hearth.
"The
Holy
Grail,"
Teabing
said,
his
voice
sermonic.
"Most
people
ask
me
only
where
it
is.
I
fear
that
is
a
question
I
may
never
answer."
He
turned
and
looked
directly
at
Sophie.
"However
the
far
more
relevant
question
is
this:
What
is
the
Holy
Grail?"
Sophie
sensed
a
rising
air
of
academic
anticipation
now
in
both
of
her
male
companions.
"To
fully
understand
the
Grail,"
Teabing
continued,
"we
must
first
understand
the
Bible.
How
well
do
you
know
the
New
Testament?"
Sophie
shrugged.
"Not
at
all,
really.
I
was
raised
by
a
man
who
worshipped
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Teabing
looked
both
startled
and
pleased.
"An
enlightened
soul.
Superb!
Then
you
must
be
aware
that
Leonardo
was
one
of
the
keepers
of
the
secret
of
the
Holy
Grail.
And
he
hid
clues
in
his
art."
"Robert
told
me
as
much,
yes."
"And
Da
Vinci's
views
on
the
New
Testament?"
"I
have
no
idea."
Teabing's
eyes
turned
mirthful
as
he
motioned
to
the
bookshelf
across
the
room.
"Robert,
would
you
mind?
On
the
bottom
shelf.
La
Storia
di
Leonardo.
Langdon
went
across
the
room,
found
a
large
art
book,
and
brought
it
back,
setting
it
down
on
the
table
between
them.
Twisting
the
book
to
face
Sophie,
Teabing
flipped
open
the
heavy
cover
and
pointed
inside
the
rear
cover
to
a
series
of
quotations.
"From
Da
Vinci's
notebook
on
polemics
and
speculation,"
Teabing
said,
indicating
one
quote
in
particular.
"I
think
you'll
find
this
relevant
to
our
discussion."
Sophie
read
the
words.
Many
have
made
a
trade
of
delusions
and
false
miracles,
deceiving
the
