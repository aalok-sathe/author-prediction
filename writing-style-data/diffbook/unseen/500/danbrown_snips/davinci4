wore
around
his
thigh
cut
into
his
flesh,
and
yet
his
soul
sang
with
satisfaction
of
service
to
the
Lord.
Pain
is
good.
His
red
eyes
scanned
the
lobby
as
he
entered
the
residence.
Empty.
He
climbed
the
stairs
quietly,
not
wanting
to
awaken
any
of
his
fellow
numeraries.
His
bedroom
door
was
open;
locks
were
forbidden
here.
He
entered,
closing
the
door
behind
him.
The
room
was
spartan
hardwood
floors,
a
pine
dresser,
a
canvas
mat
in
the
corner
that
served
as
his
bed.
He
was
a
visitor
here
this
week,
and
yet
for
many
years
he
had
been
blessed
with
a
similar
sanctuary
in
New
York
City.
The
Lord
has
provided
me
shelter
and
purpose
in
my
life.
Tonight,
at
last,
Silas
felt
he
had
begun
to
repay
his
debt.
Hurrying
to
the
dresser,
he
found
the
cell
phone
hidden
in
his
bottom
drawer
and
placed
a
call.
"Yes?"
a
male
voice
answered.
"Teacher,
I
have
returned."
"Speak,"
the
voice
commanded,
sounding
pleased
to
hear
from
him.
"All
four
are
gone.
The
three
senechaux
and
the
Grand
Master
himself."
There
was
a
momentary
pause,
as
if
for
prayer.
"Then
I
assume
you
have
the
information?"
"All
four
concurred.
Independently."
"And
you
believed
them?"
"Their
agreement
was
too
great
for
coincidence."
An
excited
breath.
"Excellent.
I
had
feared
the
brotherhood's
reputation
for
secrecy
might
prevail."
"The
prospect
of
death
is
strong
motivation."
"So,
my
pupil,
tell
me
what
I
must
know."
Silas
knew
the
information
he
had
gleaned
from
his
victims
would
come
as
a
shock.
"Teacher,
all
four
confirmed
the
existence
of
the
clef
de
voiite
the
legendary
keystone.
He
heard
a
quick
intake
of
breath
over
the
phone
and
could
feel
the
Teacher's
excitement.
"The
keystone.
Exactly
as
we
suspected."
According
to
lore,
the
brotherhood
had
created
a
map
of
stone
a
clef
de
voiite
or
keystone
an
engraved
tablet
that
revealed
the
final
resting
place
of
the
brotherhood's
greatest
secret
information
so
powerful
that
its
protection
was
the
reason
for
the
brotherhood's
very
existence.
"When
we
possess
the
keystone,"
the
Teacher
said,
"we
will
be
only
one
step
away."
"We
are
closer
than
you
think.
The
keystone
is
here
in
Paris."
"Paris?
Incredible.
It
is
almost
too
easy."
Silas
relayed
the
earlier
events
of
the
evening
how
all
four
of
his
victims,
moments
before
death,
had
desperately
tried
to
buy
back
their
godless
lives
by
telling
their
secret.
Each
had
told
Silas
the
exact
same
thing
that
the
keystone
was
ingeniously
hidden
at
a
precise
location
inside
one
of
Paris's
ancient
churches
the
Eglise
de
SaintSulpice.
"Inside
a
house
of
the
Lord,"
the
Teacher
exclaimed.
"How
they
mock
us!"
"As
they
have
for
centuries."
The
Teacher
fell
silent,
as
if
letting
the
triumph
of
this
moment
settle
over
him.
Finally,
he
spoke.
"You
have
done
a
great
service
to
God.
We
have
waited
centuries
for
this.
You
must
retrieve
the
stone
for
me.
Immediately.
Tonight.
You
understand
the
stakes."
Silas
knew
the
stakes
were
incalculable,
and
