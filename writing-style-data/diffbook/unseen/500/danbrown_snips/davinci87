sealed
off
Avenue
Gabriel!
Langdon
gave
a
grim
sigh.
"I
take
it
the
embassy
is
off
limits
this
evening?"
Down
the
street,
the
two
DCPJ
officers
who
stood
beside
their
cars
were
now
staring
in
their
direction,
apparently
curious
about
the
headlights
that
had
halted
so
abruptly
up
the
street
from
them.
Okay,
Sophie,
turn
around
very
slowly.
Putting
the
SmartCar
in
reverse,
she
performed
a
composed
three
point
turn
and
reversed
her
direction.
As
she
drove
away,
she
heard
the
sound
of
squealing
tires
behind
them.
Sirens
blared
to
life.
Cursing,
Sophie
slammed
down
the
accelerator.
Sophie's
SmartCar
tore
through
the
diplomatic
quarter,
weaving
past
embassies
and
consulates,
finally
racing
out
a
side
street
and
taking
a
right
turn
back
onto
the
massive
thoroughfare
of
Champs
Elysees.
Langdon
sat
white
knuckled
in
the
passenger
seat,
twisted
backward,
scanning
behind
them
for
any
signs
of
the
police.
He
suddenly
wished
he
had
not
decided
to
run.
You
didn't,
he
reminded
himself.
Sophie
had
made
the
decision
for
him
when
she
threw
the
GPS
dot
out
the
bathroom
window.
Now,
as
they
sped
away
from
the
embassy,
serpentining
through
sparse
traffic
on
Champs
Elysees,
Langdon
felt
his
options
deteriorating.
Although
Sophie
seemed
to
have
lost
the
police,
at
least
for
the
moment,
Langdon
doubted
their
luck
would
hold
for
long.
Behind
the
wheel
Sophie
was
fishing
in
her
sweater
pocket.
She
removed
a
small
metal
object
and
held
it
out
for
him.
"Robert,
you'd
better
have
a
look
at
this.
This
is
what
my
grandfather
left
me
behind
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
Feeling
a
shiver
of
anticipation,
Langdon
took
the
object
and
examined
it.
It
was
heavy
and
shaped
like
a
cruciform.
His
first
instinct
was
that
he
was
holding
a
funeral
pieu
a
miniature
version
of
a
memorial
spike
designed
to
be
stuck
into
the
ground
at
a
gravesite.
But
then
he
noted
the
shaft
protruding
from
the
cruciform
was
prismatic
and
triangular.
The
shaft
was
also
pockmarked
with
hundreds
of
tiny
hexagons
that
appeared
to
be
finely
tooled
and
scattered
at
random.
"It's
a
laser
cut
key,"
Sophie
told
him.
"Those
hexagons
are
read
by
an
electric
eye."
A
key?
Langdon
had
never
seen
anything
like
it.
"Look
at
the
other
side,"
she
said,
changing
lanes
and
sailing
through
an
intersection.
When
Langdon
turned
the
key,
he
felt
his
jaw
drop.
There,
intricately
embossed
on
the
center
of
the
cross,
was
a
stylized
fleur
de
lis
with
the
initials
P.S.!
"Sophie,"
he
said,
"this
is
the
seal
I
told
you
about!
The
official
device
of
the
Priory
of
Sion."
She
nodded.
"As
I
told
you,
I
saw
the
key
a
long
time
ago.
He
told
me
never
to
speak
of
it
again."
Langdon's
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
the
embossed
key.
Its
high
tech
tooling
and
age
old
symbolism
exuded
an
eerie
fusion
of
ancient
and
modern
worlds.
"He
told
me
the
key
opened
a
box
where
he
kept
many
secrets."
Langdon
felt
a
chill
to
imagine
what
kind
