decision
to
take
bold
action.
The
gun
in
his
hand
was
a
concealable,
small
caliber,
J
frame
Medusa,
but
it
would
be
plenty
deadly
at
close
range.
Stepping
from
the
shadows,
Remy
marched
into
the
circular
chamber
and
aimed
the
gun
directly
at
Teabing's
head.
"Old
man,
I've
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
do
this."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
heart
practically
stalled
to
see
Remy
aiming
a
gun
at
him.
What
is
he
doing!
Teabing
recognized
the
tiny
Medusa
revolver
as
his
own,
the
one
he
kept
locked
in
the
limousine
glove
box
for
safety.
"Remy?"
Teabing
sputtered
in
shock.
"What
is
going
on?"
Langdon
and
Sophie
looked
equally
dumbstruck.
Remy
circled
behind
Teabing
and
rammed
the
pistol
barrel
into
his
back,
high
and
on
the
left,
directly
behind
his
heart.
Teabing
felt
his
muscles
seize
with
terror.
"Remy,
I
don't
"I'll
make
it
simple,"
Remy
snapped,
eyeing
Langdon
over
Teabing's
shoulder.
"Set
down
the
keystone,
or
I
pull
the
trigger."
Langdon
seemed
momentarily
paralyzed.
"The
keystone
is
worthless
to
you,"
he
stammered.
"You
cannot
possibly
open
it."
"Arrogant
fools,"
Remy
sneered.
"Have
you
not
noticed
that
I
have
been
listening
tonight
as
you
discussed
these
poems?
Everything
I
heard,
I
have
shared
with
others.
Others
who
know
more
than
you.
You
are
not
even
looking
in
the
right
place.
The
tomb
you
seek
is
in
another
location
entirely!"
Teabing
felt
panicked.
What
is
he
saying!
"Why
do
you
want
the
Grail?"
Langdon
demanded.
"To
destroy
it?
Before
the
End
of
Days?"
Remy
called
to
the
monk.
"Silas,
take
the
keystone
from
Mr.
Langdon."
As
the
monk
advanced,
Langdon
stepped
back,
raising
the
keystone
high,
looking
fully
prepared
to
hurl
it
at
the
floor.
"I
would
rather
break
it,"
Langdon
said,
"than
see
it
in
the
wrong
hands."
Teabing
now
felt
a
wave
of
horror.
He
could
see
his
life's
work
evaporating
before
his
eyes.
All
his
dreams
about
to
be
shattered.
"Robert,
no!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"Don't!
That's
the
Grail
you're
holding!
Remy
would
never
shoot
me.
We've
known
each
other
for
ten
Remy
aimed
at
the
ceiling
and
fired
the
Medusa.
The
blast
was
enormous
for
such
a
small
weapon,
the
gunshot
echoing
like
thunder
inside
the
stone
chamber.
Everyone
froze.
"I
am
not
playing
games,"
Remy
said.
"The
next
one
is
in
his
back.
Hand
the
keystone
to
Silas."
Langdon
reluctantly
held
out
the
cryptex.
Silas
stepped
forward
and
took
it,
his
red
eyes
gleaming
with
the
self
satisfaction
of
vengeance.
Slipping
the
keystone
in
the
pocket
of
his
robe,
Silas
backed
off,
still
holding
Langdon
and
Sophie
at
gunpoint.
Teabing
felt
Remy's
arm
clamp
hard
around
his
neck
as
the
servant
began
backing
out
of
the
building,
dragging
Teabing
with
him,
the
gun
still
pressed
in
his
back.
"Let
him
go,"
Langdon
demanded.
"We're
taking
Mr.
Teabing
for
a
drive,"
Remy
said,
still
backing
up.
"If
you
call
the
police,
he
will
die.
If
you
do
anything
to
interfere,
he
will
die.
Is
that
clear?"
"Take
me,"
