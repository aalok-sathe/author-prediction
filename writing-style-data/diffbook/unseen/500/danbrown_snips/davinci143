kind
of
hybrid
religion
that
was
acceptable
to
both
parties."
"Transmogrification,"
Langdon
said.
"The
vestiges
of
pagan
religion
in
Christian
symbology
are
undeniable.
Egyptian
sun
disks
became
the
halos
of
Catholic
saints.
Pictograms
of
Isis
nursing
her
miraculously
conceived
son
Horus
became
the
blueprint
for
our
modern
images
of
the
Virgin
Mary
nursing
Baby
Jesus.
And
virtually
all
the
elements
of
the
Catholic
ritual
the
miter,
the
altar,
the
doxology,
and
communion,
the
act
of
"God
eating"
were
taken
directly
from
earlier
pagan
mystery
religions."
Teabing
groaned.
"Don't
get
a
symbologist
started
on
Christian
icons.
Nothing
in
Christianity
is
original.
The
pre
Christian
God
Mithras
called
the
Son
of
God
and
the
Light
of
the
World
was
born
on
December
25,
died,
was
buried
in
a
rock
tomb,
and
then
resurrected
in
three
days.
By
the
way,
December
25
is
also
the
birthday
of
Osiris,
Adonis,
and
Dionysus.
The
newborn
Krishna
was
presented
with
gold,
frankincense,
and
myrrh.
Even
Christianity's
weekly
holy
day
was
stolen
from
the
pagans."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"Originally,"
Langdon
said,
"Christianity
honored
the
Jewish
Sabbath
of
Saturday,
but
Constantine
shifted
it
to
coincide
with
the
pagan's
veneration
day
of
the
sun."
He
paused,
grinning.
"To
this
day,
most
churchgoers
attend
services
on
Sunday
morning
with
no
idea
that
they
are
there
on
account
of
the
pagan
sun
god's
weekly
tribute
Sunday."
Sophie's
head
was
spinning.
"And
all
of
this
relates
to
the
Grail?"
"Indeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Stay
with
me.
During
this
fusion
of
religions,
Constantine
needed
to
strengthen
the
new
Christian
tradition,
and
held
a
famous
ecumenical
gathering
known
as
the
Council
of
Nicaea."
Sophie
had
heard
of
it
only
insofar
as
its
being
the
birthplace
of
the
Nicene
Creed.
"At
this
gathering,"
Teabing
said,
"many
aspects
of
Christianity
were
debated
and
voted
upon
the
date
of
Easter,
the
role
of
the
bishops,
the
administration
of
sacraments,
and,
of
course,
the
divinity
of
Jesus."
"I
don't
follow.
His
divinity?"
"My
dear,"
Teabing
declared,
"until
that
moment
in
history,
Jesus
was
viewed
by
His
followers
as
a
mortal
prophet
a
great
and
powerful
man,
but
a
man
nonetheless.
A
mortal."
"Not
the
Son
of
God?"
"Right,"
Teabing
said.
"Jesus'
establishment
as
'the
Son
of
God'
was
officially
proposed
and
voted
on
by
the
Council
of
Nicaea.
"Hold
on.
You're
saying
Jesus'
divinity
was
the
result
of
a
vote?"
"A
relatively
close
vote
at
that,"
Teabing
added.
"Nonetheless,
establishing
Christ's
divinity
was
critical
to
the
further
unification
of
the
Roman
empire
and
to
the
new
Vatican
power
base.
By
officially
endorsing
Jesus
as
the
Son
of
God,
Constantine
turned
Jesus
into
a
deity
who
existed
beyond
the
scope
of
the
human
world,
an
entity
whose
power
was
unchallengeable.
This
not
only
precluded
further
pagan
challenges
to
Christianity,
but
now
the
followers
of
Christ
were
able
to
redeem
themselves
only
via
the
established
sacred
channel
the
Roman
Catholic
Church.
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
and
he
gave
her
a
soft
nod
of
concurrence.
"It
was
all
about
power,"
Teabing
