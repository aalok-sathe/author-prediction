as
such.
And
yet,
as
someone
who
has
spent
his
life
in
search
of
the
Grail,
I
feel
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
you
are
about
to
step
onto
a
path
from
which
there
is
no
return,
regardless
of
the
dangers
involved."
He
turned
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
your
grandfather
gave
you
this
cryptex
in
hopes
you
would
keep
the
secret
of
the
Holy
Grail
alive."
"Yes."
"Understandably,
you
feel
obliged
to
follow
the
trail
wherever
it
leads."
Sophie
nodded,
although
she
felt
a
second
motivation
still
burning
within
her.
The
truth
about
my
family.
Despite
Langdon's
assurances
that
the
keystone
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
past,
Sophie
still
sensed
something
deeply
personal
entwined
within
this
mystery,
as
if
this
cryptex,
forged
by
her
grandfather's
own
hands,
were
trying
to
speak
to
her
and
offer
some
kind
of
resolution
to
the
emptiness
that
had
haunted
her
all
these
years.
"Your
grandfather
and
three
others
died
tonight,"
Teabing
continued,
"and
they
did
so
to
keep
this
keystone
away
from
the
Church.
Opus
Dei
came
within
inches
tonight
of
possessing
it.
You
understand,
I
hope,
that
this
puts
you
in
a
position
of
exceptional
responsibility.
You
have
been
handed
a
torch.
A
two
thousand
year
old
flame
that
cannot
be
allowed
to
go
out.
This
torch
cannot
fall
into
the
wrong
hands."
He
paused,
glancing
at
the
rosewood
box.
"I
realize
you
have
been
given
no
choice
in
this
matter,
Miss
Neveu,
but
considering
what
is
at
stake
here,
you
must
either
fully
embrace
this
responsibility
or
you
must
pass
that
responsibility
to
someone
else."
"My
grandfather
gave
the
cryptex
to
me.
I'm
sure
he
thought
I
could
handle
the
responsibility."
Teabing
looked
encouraged
but
unconvinced.
"Good.
A
strong
will
is
necessary.
And
yet,
I
am
curious
if
you
understand
that
successfully
unlocking
the
keystone
will
bring
with
it
a
far
greater
trial."
"How
so?"
"My
dear,
imagine
that
you
are
suddenly
holding
a
map
that
reveals
the
location
of
the
Holy
Grail.
In
that
moment,
you
will
be
in
possession
of
a
truth
capable
of
altering
history
forever.
You
will
be
the
keeper
of
a
truth
that
man
has
sought
for
centuries.
You
will
be
faced
with
the
responsibility
of
revealing
that
truth
to
the
world.
The
individual
who
does
so
will
be
revered
by
many
and
despised
by
many.
The
question
is
whether
you
will
have
the
necessary
strength
to
carry
out
that
task."
Sophie
paused.
"I'm
not
sure
that
is
my
decision
to
make."
Teabing's
eyebrows
arched.
"No?
If
not
the
possessor
of
the
keystone,
then
who?"
"The
brotherhood
who
has
successfully
protected
the
secret
for
so
long."
"The
Priory?"
Teabing
looked
skeptical.
"But
how?
The
brotherhood
was
shattered
tonight.
Decapitated,
as
you
so
aptly
put
it.
Whether
they
were
infiltrated
by
some
kind
of
eavesdropping
or
by
a
spy
within
their
ranks,
we
will
never
know,
but
the
fact
remains
that
someone
got
to
them
and
uncovered
the
identities
of
their
four
top
members.
