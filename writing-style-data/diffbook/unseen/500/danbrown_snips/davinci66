in
the
entire
house,
Sophie
mustered
the
courage
to
sneak
into
her
grandfather's
bedroom.
The
room
was
off
limits
to
her,
but
her
grandfather
was
downstairs
asleep
on
the
couch.
I'll
just
take
a
fast
peek!
Tiptoeing
across
the
creaky
wood
floor
to
his
closet,
Sophie
peered
on
the
shelves
behind
his
clothing.
Nothing.
Next
she
looked
under
the
bed.
Still
nothing.
Moving
to
his
bureau,
she
opened
the
drawers
and
one
by
one
began
pawing
carefully
through
them.
There
must
be
something
for
me
here!
As
she
reached
the
bottom
drawer,
she
still
had
not
found
any
hint
of
a
doll.
Dejected,
she
opened
the
final
drawer
and
pulled
aside
some
black
clothes
she
had
never
seen
him
wear.
She
was
about
to
close
the
drawer
when
her
eyes
caught
a
glint
of
gold
in
the
back
of
the
drawer.
It
looked
like
a
pocket
watch
chain,
but
she
knew
he
didn't
wear
one.
Her
heart
raced
as
she
realized
what
it
must
be.
A
necklace!
Sophie
carefully
pulled
the
chain
from
the
drawer.
To
her
surprise,
on
the
end
was
a
brilliant
gold
key.
Heavy
and
shimmering.
Spellbound,
she
held
it
up.
It
looked
like
no
key
she
had
ever
seen.
Most
keys
were
flat
with
jagged
teeth,
but
this
one
had
a
triangular
column
with
little
pockmarks
all
over
it.
Its
large
golden
head
was
in
the
shape
of
a
cross,
but
not
a
normal
cross.
This
was
an
even
armed
one,
like
a
plus
sign.
Embossed
in
the
middle
of
the
cross
was
a
strange
symbol
two
letters
intertwined
with
some
kind
of
flowery
design.
"P.S.,"
she
whispered,
scowling
as
she
read
the
letters.
Whatever
could
this
be?
"Sophie?"
her
grandfather
spoke
from
the
doorway.
Startled,
she
spun,
dropping
the
key
on
the
floor
with
a
loud
clang.
She
stared
down
at
the
key,
afraid
to
look
up
at
her
grandfather's
face.
"I
was
looking
for
my
birthday
present,"
she
said,
hanging
her
head,
knowing
she
had
betrayed
his
trust.
For
what
seemed
like
an
eternity,
her
grandfather
stood
silently
in
the
doorway.
Finally,
he
let
out
a
long
troubled
breath.
"Pick
up
the
key,
Sophie."
Sophie
retrieved
the
key.
Her
grandfather
walked
in.
"Sophie,
you
need
to
respect
other
people's
privacy."
Gently,
he
knelt
down
and
took
the
key
from
her.
"This
key
is
very
special.
If
you
had
lost
it"
Her
grandfather's
quiet
voice
made
Sophie
feel
even
worse.
"I'm
sorry,
Grand
pere.
I
really
am."
She
paused.
"I
thought
it
was
a
necklace
for
my
birthday."
He
gazed
at
her
for
several
seconds.
"I'll
say
this
once
more,
Sophie,
because
it's
important.
You
need
to
learn
to
respect
other
people's
privacy."
"Yes,
Grand
pere.
"We'll
talk
about
this
some
other
time.
Right
now,
the
garden
needs
to
be
weeded."
Sophie
hurried
outside
to
do
her
chores.
The
next
morning,
Sophie
received
no
birthday
present
from
her
grandfather.
She
hadn't
expected
one,
not
after
what
she
had
done.
But
he
didn't
even
wish
her
