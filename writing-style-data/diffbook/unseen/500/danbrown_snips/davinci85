grandfather
asleep
at
this
hour
and
was
excited
to
see
the
house
twinkling
with
lights.
Her
delight
turned
to
surprise,
however,
when
she
arrived
to
find
the
driveway
filled
with
parked
cars
Mercedeses,
BMWs,
Audis,
and
a
Rolls
Royce.
Sophie
stared
a
moment
and
then
burst
out
laughing.
My
grand
pere,
the
famous
recluse!
Jacques
Sauniere,
it
seemed,
was
far
less
reclusive
than
he
liked
to
pretend.
Clearly
he
was
hosting
a
party
while
Sophie
was
away
at
school,
and
from
the
looks
of
the
automobiles,
some
of
Paris's
most
influential
people
were
in
attendance.
Eager
to
surprise
him,
she
hurried
to
the
front
door.
When
she
got
there,
though,
she
found
it
locked.
She
knocked.
Nobody
answered.
Puzzled,
she
walked
around
and
tried
the
back
door.
It
too
was
locked.
No
answer.
Confused,
she
stood
a
moment
and
listened.
The
only
sound
she
heard
was
the
cool
Normandy
air
letting
out
a
low
moan
as
it
swirled
through
the
valley.
No
music.
No
voices.
Nothing.
In
the
silence
of
the
woods,
Sophie
hurried
to
the
side
of
the
house
and
clambered
up
on
a
woodpile,
pressing
her
face
to
the
living
room
window.
What
she
saw
inside
made
no
sense
at
all.
"Nobody's
here!"
The
entire
first
floor
looked
deserted.
Where
are
all
the
people
?
Heart
racing,
Sophie
ran
to
the
woodshed
and
got
the
spare
key
her
grandfather
kept
hidden
under
the
kindling
box.
She
ran
to
the
front
door
and
let
herself
in.
As
she
stepped
into
the
deserted
foyer,
the
control
panel
for
the
security
system
started
blinking
red
a
warning
that
the
entrant
had
ten
seconds
to
type
the
proper
code
before
the
security
alarms
went
off.
He
has
the
alarm
on
during
a
party?
Sophie
quickly
typed
the
code
and
deactivated
the
system.
Entering,
she
found
the
entire
house
uninhabited.
Upstairs
too.
As
she
descended
again
to
the
deserted
living
room,
she
stood
a
moment
in
the
silence,
wondering
what
could
possibly
be
happening.
It
was
then
that
Sophie
heard
it.
Muffled
voices.
And
they
seemed
to
be
coming
from
underneath
her.
Sophie
could
not
imagine.
Crouching,
she
put
her
ear
to
the
floor
and
listened.
Yes,
the
sound
was
definitely
coming
from
below.
The
voices
seemed
to
be
singing,
or
chanting?
She
was
frightened.
Almost
more
eerie
than
the
sound
itself
was
the
realization
that
this
house
did
not
even
have
a
basement.
At
least
none
I've
ever
seen.
Turning
now
and
scanning
the
living
room,
Sophie's
eyes
fell
to
the
only
object
in
the
entire
house
that
seemed
out
of
place
her
grandfather's
favorite
antique,
a
sprawling
Aubusson
tapestry.
It
usually
hung
on
the
east
wall
beside
the
fireplace,
but
tonight
it
had
been
pulled
aside
on
its
brass
rod,
exposing
the
wall
behind
it.
Walking
toward
the
bare
wooden
wall,
Sophie
sensed
the
chanting
getting
louder.
Hesitant,
she
leaned
her
ear
against
the
wood.
The
voices
were
clearer
now.
People
were
definitely
chanting
intoning
words
Sophie
could
not
discern.
The
