sister,"
Langdon
said.
Out
on
the
bluff,
the
fieldstone
house
was
exactly
as
Sophie
remembered
it.
Night
was
falling
now,
and
the
house
exuded
a
warm
and
inviting
aura.
The
smell
of
bread
wafted
through
the
opened
screened
door,
and
a
golden
light
shone
in
the
windows.
As
Sophie
approached,
she
could
hear
the
quiet
sounds
of
sobbing
from
within.
Through
the
screened
door,
Sophie
saw
an
elderly
woman
in
the
hallway.
Her
back
was
to
the
door,
but
Sophie
could
see
she
was
crying.
The
woman
had
long,
luxuriant,
silver
hair
that
conjured
an
unexpected
wisp
of
memory.
Feeling
herself
drawn
closer,
Sophie
stepped
onto
the
porch
stairs.
The
woman
was
clutching
a
framed
photograph
of
a
man
and
touching
her
fingertips
to
his
face
with
loving
sadness.
It
was
a
face
Sophie
knew
well.
Grand
pere.
The
woman
had
obviously
heard
the
sad
news
of
his
death
last
night.
A
board
squeaked
beneath
Sophie's
feet,
and
the
woman
turned
slowly,
her
sad
eyes
finding
Sophie's.
Sophie
wanted
to
run,
but
she
stood
transfixed.
The
woman's
fervent
gaze
never
wavered
as
she
set
down
the
photo
and
approached
the
screened
door.
An
eternity
seemed
to
pass
as
the
two
women
stared
at
one
another
through
the
thin
mesh.
Then,
like
the
slowly
gathering
swell
of
an
ocean
wave,
the
woman's
visage
transformed
from
one
of
uncertainty
to
disbelief
to
hope
and
finally,
to
cresting
joy.
Throwing
open
the
door,
she
came
out,
reaching
with
soft
hands,
cradling
Sophie's
thunderstruck
face.
"Oh,
dear
child
look
at
you!"
Although
Sophie
did
not
recognize
her,
she
knew
who
this
woman
was.
She
tried
to
speak
but
found
she
could
not
even
breathe.
"Sophie,"
the
woman
sobbed,
kissing
her
forehead.
Sophie's
words
were
a
choked
whisper.
"But
Grand
pere
said
you
were"
"I
know."
The
woman
placed
her
tender
hands
on
Sophie's
shoulders
and
gazed
at
her
with
familiar
eyes.
"Your
grandfather
and
I
were
forced
to
say
so
many
things.
We
did
what
we
thought
was
right.
I'm
so
sorry.
It
was
for
your
own
safety,
princess."
Sophie
heard
her
final
word,
and
immediately
thought
of
her
grandfather,
who
had
called
her
princess
for
so
many
years.
The
sound
of
his
voice
seemed
to
echo
now
in
the
ancient
stones
of
Rosslyn,
settling
through
the
earth
and
reverberating
in
the
unknown
hollows
below.
The
woman
threw
her
arms
around
Sophie,
the
tears
flowing
faster.
"Your
grandfather
wanted
so
badly
to
tell
you
everything.
But
things
were
difficult
between
you
two.
He
tried
so
hard.
There's
so
much
to
explain.
So
very
much
to
explain."
She
kissed
Sophie's
forehead
once
again,
then
whispered
in
her
ear.
"No
more
secrets,
princess.
It's
time
you
learn
the
truth
about
our
family."
Sophie
and
her
grandmother
were
seated
on
the
porch
stairs
in
a
tearful
hug
when
the
young
docent
dashed
across
the
lawn,
his
eyes
shining
with
hope
and
disbelief.
"Sophie?"
Through
her
tears,
Sophie
nodded,
standing.
She
did
not
know
the
young
man's
face,
