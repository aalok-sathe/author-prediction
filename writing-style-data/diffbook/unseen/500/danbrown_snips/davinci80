yelled.
Sophie
snatched
the
key
from
behind
the
painting
and
slipped
it
deep
in
her
pocket
along
with
the
UV
penlight.
Peering
out
from
behind
the
canvas,
she
could
see
the
guard
was
still
trying
desperately
to
raise
someone
on
the
walkie
talkie.
He
was
backing
toward
the
entrance,
still
aiming
the
gun
firmly
at
Langdon.
"Au
secours!"
he
shouted
again
into
his
radio.
Static.
He
can
't
transmit,
Sophie
realized,
recalling
that
tourists
with
cell
phones
often
got
frustrated
in
here
when
they
tried
to
call
home
to
brag
about
seeing
the
Mona
Lisa.
The
extra
surveillance
wiring
in
the
walls
made
it
virtually
impossible
to
get
a
carrier
unless
you
stepped
out
into
the
hall.
The
guard
was
backing
quickly
toward
the
exit
now,
and
Sophie
knew
she
had
to
act
immediately.
Gazing
up
at
the
large
painting
behind
which
she
was
partially
ensconced,
Sophie
realized
that
Leonardo
da
Vinci,
for
the
second
time
tonight,
was
there
to
help.
Another
few
meters,
Grouard
told
himself,
keeping
his
gun
leveled.
"Arretez!
Ouje
la
detruis!"
the
woman's
voice
echoed
across
the
room.
Grouard
glanced
over
and
stopped
in
his
tracks.
"Mon
dieu,
non!"
Through
the
reddish
haze,
he
could
see
that
the
woman
had
actually
lifted
the
large
painting
off
its
cables
and
propped
it
on
the
floor
in
front
of
her.
At
five
feet
tall,
the
canvas
almost
entirely
hid
her
body.
Grouard's
first
thought
was
to
wonder
why
the
painting's
trip
wires
hadn't
set
off
alarms,
but
of
course
the
artwork
cable
sensors
had
yet
to
be
reset
tonight.
What
is
she
doing!
When
he
saw
it,
his
blood
went
cold.
The
canvas
started
to
bulge
in
the
middle,
the
fragile
outlines
of
the
Virgin
Mary,
Baby
Jesus,
and
John
the
Baptist
beginning
to
distort.
"Non!"
Grouard
screamed,
frozen
in
horror
as
he
watched
the
priceless
Da
Vinci
stretching.
The
woman
was
pushing
her
knee
into
the
center
of
the
canvas
from
behind!
"NON!"
Grouard
wheeled
and
aimed
his
gun
at
her
but
instantly
realized
it
was
an
empty
threat.
The
canvas
was
only
fabric,
but
it
was
utterly
impenetrable
a
six
million
dollar
piece
of
body
armor.
can
't
put
a
bullet
through
a
Da
Vinci!
"Set
down
your
gun
and
radio,"
the
woman
said
in
calm
French,
"or
I'll
put
my
knee
through
this
painting.
I
think
you
know
how
my
grandfather
would
feel
about
that."
Grouard
felt
dizzy.
"Please
no.
That's
Madonna
of
the
Rocks!"
He
dropped
his
gun
and
radio,
raising
his
hands
over
his
head.
"Thank
you,"
the
woman
said.
"Now
do
exactly
as
I
tell
you,
and
everything
will
work
out
fine."
Moments
later,
Langdon's
pulse
was
still
thundering
as
he
ran
beside
Sophie
down
the
emergency
stairwell
toward
the
ground
level.
Neither
of
them
had
said
a
word
since
leaving
the
trembling
Louvre
guard
lying
in
the
Salle
des
Etats.
The
guard's
pistol
was
now
clutched
tightly
in
Langdon's
hands,
and
he
couldn't
wait
to
get
rid
of
it.
The
weapon
