of
The
Lion
King
and
pausing
the
film
to
reveal
a
freeze
frame
in
which
the
word
SEX
was
clearly
visible,
spelled
out
by
floating
dust
particles
over
Simba's
head.
Although
Langdon
suspected
this
was
more
of
a
cartoonist's
sophomoric
prank
than
any
kind
of
enlightened
allusion
to
pagan
human
sexuality,
he
had
learned
not
to
underestimate
Disney's
grasp
of
symbolism.
The
Little
Mermaid
was
a
spellbinding
tapestry
of
spiritual
symbols
so
specifically
goddess
related
that
they
could
not
be
coincidence.
When
Langdon
had
first
seen
The
Little
Mermaid,
he
had
actually
gasped
aloud
when
he
noticed
that
the
painting
in
Ariel's
underwater
home
was
none
other
than
seventeenth
century
artist
Georges
de
la
Tour's
The
Penitent
Magdalene
a
famous
homage
to
the
banished
Mary
Magdalene
fitting
decor
considering
the
movie
turned
out
to
be
a
ninety
minute
collage
of
blatant
symbolic
references
to
the
lost
sanctity
of
Isis,
Eve,
Pisces
the
fish
goddess,
and,
repeatedly,
Mary
Magdalene.
The
Little
Mermaid's
name,
Ariel,
possessed
powerful
ties
to
the
sacred
feminine
and,
in
the
Book
of
Isaiah,
was
synonymous
with
"the
Holy
City
besieged."
Of
course,
the
Little
Mermaid's
flowing
red
hair
was
certainly
no
coincidence
either.
The
clicking
of
Teabing's
crutches
approached
in
the
hallway,
his
pace
unusually
brisk.
When
their
host
entered
the
study,
his
expression
was
stern.
"You'd
better
explain
yourself,
Robert,"
he
said
coldly.
"You
have
not
been
honest
with
me."
"I'm
being
framed,
Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
trying
to
stay
calm.
You
know
me.
I
wouldn't
kill
anyone.
Teabing's
tone
did
not
soften.
"Robert,
you're
on
television,
for
Christ's
sake.
Did
you
know
you
were
wanted
by
the
authorities?"
"Yes."
"Then
you
abused
my
trust.
I'm
astonished
you
would
put
me
at
risk
by
coming
here
and
asking
me
to
ramble
on
about
the
Grail
so
you
could
hide
out
in
my
home."
"I
didn't
kill
anyone."
"Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead,
and
the
police
say
you
did
it."
Teabing
looked
saddened.
"Such
a
contributor
to
the
arts"
"Sir?"
The
manservant
had
appeared
now,
standing
behind
Teabing
in
the
study
doorway,
his
arms
crossed.
"Shall
I
show
them
out?"
"Allow
me."
Teabing
hobbled
across
the
study,
unlocked
a
set
of
wide
glass
doors,
and
swung
them
open
onto
a
side
lawn.
"Please
find
your
car,
and
leave."
Sophie
did
not
move.
"We
have
information
about
the
clef
de
voute.
The
Priory
keystone.
Teabing
stared
at
her
for
several
seconds
and
scoffed
derisively.
"A
desperate
ploy.
Robert
knows
how
I've
sought
it.
"She's
telling
the
truth,"
Langdon
said.
"That's
why
we
came
to
you
tonight.
To
talk
to
you
about
the
keystone.
The
manservant
intervened
now.
"Leave,
or
I
shall
call
the
authorities."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
whispered,
"we
know
where
it
is."
Teabing's
balance
seemed
to
falter
a
bit.
Remy
now
marched
stiffly
across
the
room.
"Leave
at
once!
Or
I
will
forcibly
"Remy!"
Teabing
spun,
snapping
at
his
servant.
"Excuse
us
for
a
moment."
The
servant's
jaw
dropped.
"Sir?
I
must
protest.
These
people
are
"I'll
handle
this."
Teabing
