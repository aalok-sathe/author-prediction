he
had
read
accounts
of
Rosslyn's
arrestingly
intricate
stonework,
seeing
it
in
person
was
an
overwhelming
encounter.
Symbology
heaven,
one
of
Langdon's
colleagues
had
called
it.
Every
surface
in
the
chapel
had
been
carved
with
symbols
Christian
cruciforms,
Jewish
stars,
Masonic
seals,
Templar
crosses,
cornucopias,
pyramids,
astrological
signs,
plants,
vegetables,
pentacles,
and
roses.
The
Knights
Templar
had
been
master
stonemasons,
erecting
Templar
churches
all
over
Europe,
but
Rosslyn
was
considered
their
most
sublime
labor
of
love
and
veneration.
The
master
masons
had
left
no
stone
uncarved.
Rosslyn
Chapel
was
a
shrine
to
all
faiths
to
all
traditions
and,
above
all,
to
nature
and
the
goddess.
The
sanctuary
was
empty
except
for
a
handful
of
visitors
listening
to
a
young
man
giving
the
day's
last
tour.
He
was
leading
them
in
a
single
file
line
along
a
well
known
route
on
the
floor
an
invisible
pathway
linking
six
key
architectural
points
within
the
sanctuary.
Generations
of
visitors
had
walked
these
straight
lines,
connecting
the
points,
and
their
countless
footsteps
had
engraved
an
enormous
symbol
on
the
floor.
The
Star
of
David,
Langdon
thought.
No
coincidence
there.
Also
known
as
Solomon's
Seal,
this
hexagram
had
once
been
the
secret
symbol
of
the
stargazing
priests
and
was
later
adopted
by
the
Israelite
kings
David
and
Solomon.
The
docent
had
seen
Langdon
and
Sophie
enter,
and
although
it
was
closing
time,
offered
a
pleasant
smile
and
motioned
for
them
to
feel
free
to
look
around.
Langdon
nodded
his
thanks
and
began
to
move
deeper
into
the
sanctuary.
Sophie,
however,
stood
riveted
in
the
entryway,
a
puzzled
look
on
her
face.
"What
is
it?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
stared
out
at
the
chapel.
"I
think
I've
been
here."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"But
you
said
you
hadn't
even
heard
of
Rosslyn."
"I
hadn't"
She
scanned
the
sanctuary,
looking
uncertain.
"My
grandfather
must
have
brought
me
here
when
I
was
very
young.
I
don't
know.
It
feels
familiar."
As
her
eyes
scanned
the
room,
she
began
nodding
with
more
certainty.
"Yes."
She
pointed
to
the
front
of
the
sanctuary.
"Those
two
pillars
I've
seen
them."
Langdon
looked
at
the
pair
of
intricately
sculpted
columns
at
the
far
end
of
the
sanctuary.
Their
white
lacework
carvings
seemed
to
smolder
with
a
ruddy
glow
as
the
last
of
the
day's
sunlight
streamed
in
through
the
west
window.
The
pillars
positioned
where
the
altar
would
normally
stand
were
an
oddly
matched
pair.
The
pillar
on
the
left
was
carved
with
simple,
vertical
lines,
while
the
pillar
on
the
right
was
embellished
with
an
ornate,
flowering
spiral.
Sophie
was
already
moving
toward
them.
Langdon
hurried
after
her,
and
as
they
reached
the
pillars,
Sophie
was
nodding
with
incredulity.
"Yes,
I'm
positive
I
have
seen
these!"
"I
don't
doubt
you've
seen
them,"
Langdon
said,
"but
it
wasn't
necessarily
here.
She
turned.
"What
do
you
mean?"
"These
two
pillars
are
the
most
duplicated
architectural
structures
in
history.
Replicas
exist
all
over
the
world."
"Replicas
of
Rosslyn?"
She
looked
skeptical.
"No.
Of
the
pillars.
