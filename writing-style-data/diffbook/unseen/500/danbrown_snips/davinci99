Great.
Holy
Grail.
Sophie
was
surprised
she
had
not
spotted
the
linguistic
ties
immediately.
Even
so,
Langdon's
claim
still
made
no
sense
to
her.
"I
thought
the
Holy
Grail
was
a
cup.
You
just
told
me
the
Sangreal
is
a
collection
of
documents
that
reveals
some
dark
secret."
"Yes,
but
the
Sangreal
documents
are
only
half
of
the
Holy
Grail
treasure.
They
are
buried
with
the
Grail
itself
and
reveal
its
true
meaning.
The
documents
gave
the
Knights
Templar
so
much
power
because
the
pages
revealed
the
true
nature
of
the
Grail."
The
true
nature
of
the
Grail?
Sophie
felt
even
more
lost
now.
The
Holy
Grail,
she
had
thought,
was
the
cup
that
Jesus
drank
from
at
the
Last
Supper
and
with
which
Joseph
of
Arimathea
later
caught
His
blood
at
the
crucifixion.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
the
Cup
of
Christ,"
she
said.
"How
much
simpler
could
it
be?"
"Sophie,"
Langdon
whispered,
leaning
toward
her
now,
"according
to
the
Priory
of
Sion,
the
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
cup
at
all.
They
claim
the
Grail
legend
that
of
a
chalice
is
actually
an
ingeniously
conceived
allegory.
That
is,
that
the
Grail
story
uses
the
chalice
as
a
metaphor
for
something
else,
something
far
more
powerful."
He
paused.
"Something
that
fits
perfectly
with
everything
your
grandfather
has
been
trying
to
tell
us
tonight,
including
all
his
symbologic
references
to
the
sacred
feminine."
Still
unsure,
Sophie
sensed
in
Langdon's
patient
smile
that
he
empathized
with
her
confusion,
and
yet
his
eyes
remained
earnest.
"But
if
the
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
cup,"
she
asked,
"what
is
it?"
Langdon
had
known
this
question
was
coming,
and
yet
he
still
felt
uncertain
exactly
how
to
tell
her.
If
he
did
not
present
the
answer
in
the
proper
historical
background,
Sophie
would
be
left
with
a
vacant
air
of
bewilderment
the
exact
expression
Langdon
had
seen
on
his
own
editor's
face
a
few
months
ago
after
Langdon
handed
him
a
draft
of
the
manuscript
he
was
working
on.
"This
manuscript
claims
what?"
his
editor
had
choked,
setting
down
his
wineglass
and
staring
across
his
half
eaten
power
lunch.
"You
can't
be
serious."
"Serious
enough
to
have
spent
a
year
researching
it."
Prominent
New
York
editor
Jonas
Faukman
tugged
nervously
at
his
goatee.
Faukman
no
doubt
had
heard
some
wild
book
ideas
in
his
illustrious
career,
but
this
one
seemed
to
have
left
the
man
flabbergasted.
"Robert,"
Faukman
finally
said,
"don't
get
me
wrong.
I
love
your
work,
and
we've
had
a
great
run
together.
But
if
I
agree
to
publish
an
idea
like
this,
I'll
have
people
picketing
outside
my
office
for
months.
Besides,
it
will
kill
your
reputation.
You're
a
Harvard
historian,
for
God's
sake,
not
a
pop
schlockmeister
looking
for
a
quick
buck.
Where
could
you
possibly
find
enough
credible
evidence
to
support
a
theory
like
this?"
With
a
quiet
smile
Langdon
pulled
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat
and
handed
it
to
Faukman.
