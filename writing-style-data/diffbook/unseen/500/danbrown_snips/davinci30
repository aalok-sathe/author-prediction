a
striking
personal
confidence.
To
Langdon's
surprise,
the
woman
walked
directly
up
to
him
and
extended
a
polite
hand.
"Monsieur
Langdon,
I
am
Agent
Neveu
from
DCPJ's
Cryptology
Department."
Her
words
curved
richly
around
her
muted
Anglo
Franco
accent.
"It
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
you."
Langdon
took
her
soft
palm
in
his
and
felt
himself
momentarily
fixed
in
her
strong
gaze.
Her
eyes
were
olive
green
incisive
and
clear.
Fache
drew
a
seething
inhalation,
clearly
preparing
to
launch
into
a
reprimand.
"Captain,"
she
said,
turning
quickly
and
beating
him
to
the
punch,
"please
excuse
the
interruption,
but"
"Ce
n
'est
pas
le
moment!"
Fache
sputtered.
"I
tried
to
phone
you."
Sophie
continued
in
English,
as
if
out
of
courtesy
to
Langdon.
"But
your
cell
phone
was
turned
off.
"I
turned
it
off
for
a
reason,"
Fache
hissed.
"I
am
speaking
to
Mr.
Langdon."
"I've
deciphered
the
numeric
code,"
she
said
flatly.
Langdon
felt
a
pulse
of
excitement.
She
broke
the
code
?
Fache
looked
uncertain
how
to
respond.
"Before
I
explain,"
Sophie
said,
"I
have
an
urgent
message
for
Mr.
Langdon."
Fache's
expression
turned
to
one
of
deepening
concern.
"For
Mr.
Langdon?"
She
nodded,
turning
back
to
Langdon.
"You
need
to
contact
the
U.S.
Embassy,
Mr.
Langdon.
They
have
a
message
for
you
from
the
States."
Langdon
reacted
with
surprise,
his
excitement
over
the
code
giving
way
to
a
sudden
ripple
of
concern.
A
message
from
the
States?
He
tried
to
imagine
who
could
be
trying
to
reach
him.
Only
a
few
of
his
colleagues
knew
he
was
in
Paris.
Fache's
broad
jaw
had
tightened
with
the
news.
"The
U.S.
Embassy?"
he
demanded,
sounding
suspicious.
"How
would
they
know
to
find
Mr.
Langdon
here?"
Sophie
shrugged.
"Apparently
they
called
Mr.
Langdon's
hotel,
and
the
concierge
told
them
Mr.
Langdon
had
been
collected
by
a
DCPJ
agent."
Fache
looked
troubled.
"And
the
embassy
contacted
DCPJ
Cryptography?"
"No,
sir,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
firm.
"When
I
called
the
DCPJ
switchboard
in
an
attempt
to
contact
you,
they
had
a
message
waiting
for
Mr.
Langdon
and
asked
me
to
pass
it
along
if
I
got
through
to
you."
Fache's
brow
furrowed
in
apparent
confusion.
He
opened
his
mouth
to
speak,
but
Sophie
had
already
turned
back
to
Langdon.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
she
declared,
pulling
a
small
slip
of
paper
from
her
pocket,
"this
is
the
number
for
your
embassy's
messaging
service.
They
asked
that
you
phone
in
as
soon
as
possible."
She
handed
him
the
paper
with
an
intent
gaze.
"While
I
explain
the
code
to
Captain
Fache,
you
need
to
make
this
call."
Langdon
studied
the
slip.
It
had
a
Paris
phone
number
and
extension
on
it.
"Thank
you,"
he
said,
feeling
worried
now.
"Where
do
I
find
a
phone?"
Sophie
began
to
pull
a
cell
phone
from
her
sweater
pocket,
but
Fache
waved
her
off.
He
now
looked
like
Mount
Vesuvius
about
to
erupt.
Without
taking
his
eyes
off
Sophie,
he
produced
his
own
cell
phone
and
held
it
out.
"This
