Magdalene
and
slicing
his
blade
like
hand
across
her
neck.
The
same
threatening
gesture
as
in
Madonna
of
the
Rocks!
"And
here
too,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
now
to
the
crowd
of
disciples
near
Peter.
"A
bit
ominous,
no?"
Sophie
squinted
and
saw
a
hand
emerging
from
the
crowd
of
disciples.
"Is
that
hand
wielding
a
dagger?"
"Yes.
Stranger
still,
if
you
count
the
arms,
you'll
see
that
this
hand
belongs
to
no
one
at
all.
It's
disembodied.
Anonymous."
Sophie
was
starting
to
feel
overwhelmed.
"I'm
sorry,
I
still
don't
understand
how
all
of
this
makes
Mary
Magdalene
the
Holy
Grail."
"Aha!"
Teabing
exclaimed
again.
"Therein
lies
the
rub!"
He
turned
once
more
to
the
table
and
pulled
out
a
large
chart,
spreading
it
out
for
her.
It
was
an
elaborate
genealogy.
"Few
people
realize
that
Mary
Magdalene,
in
addition
to
being
Christ's
right
hand,
was
a
powerful
woman
already."
Sophie
could
now
see
the
title
of
the
family
tree.
THE
TRIBE
OF
BENJAMIN
"Mary
Magdalene
is
here,"
Teabing
said,
pointing
near
the
top
of
the
genealogy.
Sophie
was
surprised.
"She
was
of
the
House
of
Benjamin?"
"Indeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Mary
Magdalene
was
of
royal
descent."
"But
I
was
under
the
impression
Magdalene
was
poor."
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"Magdalene
was
recast
as
a
whore
in
order
to
erase
evidence
of
her
powerful
family
ties."
Sophie
found
herself
again
glancing
at
Langdon,
who
again
nodded.
She
turned
back
to
Teabing.
"But
why
would
the
early
Church
care
if
Magdalene
had
royal
blood?"
The
Briton
smiled.
"My
dear
child,
it
was
not
Mary
Magdalene's
royal
blood
that
concerned
the
Church
so
much
as
it
was
her
consorting
with
Christ,
who
also
had
royal
blood.
As
you
know,
the
Book
of
Matthew
tells
us
that
Jesus
was
of
the
House
of
David.
A
descendant
of
King
Solomon
King
of
the
Jews.
By
marrying
into
the
powerful
House
of
Benjamin,
Jesus
fused
two
royal
bloodlines,
creating
a
potent
political
union
with
the
potential
of
making
a
legitimate
claim
to
the
throne
and
restoring
the
line
of
kings
as
it
was
under
Solomon."
Sophie
sensed
he
was
at
last
coming
to
his
point.
Teabing
looked
excited
now.
"The
legend
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
legend
about
royal
blood.
When
Grail
legend
speaks
of
'the
chalice
that
held
the
blood
of
Christ'
it
speaks,
in
fact,
of
Mary
Magdalene
the
female
womb
that
carried
Jesus'
royal
bloodline."
The
words
seemed
to
echo
across
the
ballroom
and
back
before
they
fully
registered
in
Sophie's
mind.
Mary
Magdalene
carried
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ?
"But
how
could
Christ
have
a
bloodline
unless?"
She
paused
and
looked
at
Langdon.
Langdon
smiled
softly.
"Unless
they
had
a
child."
Sophie
stood
transfixed.
"Behold,"
Teabing
proclaimed,
"the
greatest
cover
up
in
human
history.
Not
only
was
Jesus
Christ
married,
but
He
was
a
father.
My
dear,
Mary
Magdalene
was
the
Holy
Vessel.
She
was
the
chalice
that
bore
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ.
She
was
the
womb
that
bore
