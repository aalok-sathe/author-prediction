he
will
kill
us
both.
Even
without
looking
at
Sophie,
he
could
hear
her
heart
beseeching
him
in
silent
desperation.
Robert,
this
man
is
not
worthy
of
the
Grail.
Please
do
not
place
it
in
his
hands.
No
matter
what
the
cost.
Langdon
had
already
made
his
decision
several
minutes
ago,
while
standing
alone
at
the
window
overlooking
College
Garden.
Protect
Sophie.
Protect
the
Grail.
Langdon
had
almost
shouted
out
in
desperation.
But
I
cannot
see
how!
The
stark
moments
of
disillusionment
had
brought
with
them
a
clarity
unlike
any
he
had
ever
felt.
The
Truth
is
right
before
your
eyes,
Robert.
He
knew
not
from
where
the
epiphany
came.
The
Grail
is
not
mocking
you,
she
is
calling
out
to
a
worthy
soul.
Now,
bowing
down
like
a
subject
several
yards
in
front
of
Leigh
Teabing,
Langdon
lowered
the
cryptex
to
within
inches
of
the
stone
floor.
"Yes,
Robert,"
Teabing
whispered,
aiming
the
gun
at
him.
"Set
it
down."
Langdon's
eyes
moved
heavenward,
up
into
the
gaping
void
of
the
Chapter
House
cupola.
Crouching
lower,
Langdon
lowered
his
gaze
to
Teabing's
gun,
aimed
directly
at
him.
"I'm
sorry,
Leigh."
In
one
fluid
motion,
Langdon
leapt
up,
swinging
his
arm
skyward,
launching
the
cryptex
straight
up
toward
the
dome
above.
Leigh
Teabing
did
not
feel
his
finger
pull
the
trigger,
but
the
Medusa
discharged
with
a
thundering
crash.
Langdon's
crouched
form
was
now
vertical,
almost
airborne,
and
the
bullet
exploded
in
the
floor
near
Langdon's
feet.
Half
of
Teabing's
brain
attempted
to
adjust
his
aim
and
fire
again
in
rage,
but
the
more
powerful
half
dragged
his
eyes
upward
into
the
cupola.
The
keystone!
Time
seemed
to
freeze,
morphing
into
a
slow
motion
dream
as
Teabing's
entire
world
became
the
airborne
keystone.
He
watched
it
rise
to
the
apex
of
its
climb
hovering
for
a
moment
in
the
void
and
then
tumbling
downward,
end
over
end,
back
toward
the
stone
floor.
All
of
Teabing's
hopes
and
dreams
were
plummeting
toward
earth.
It
cannot
strike
the
floor!
I
can
reach
it!
Teabing's
body
reacted
on
instinct.
He
released
the
gun
and
heaved
himself
forward,
dropping
his
crutches
as
he
reached
out
with
his
soft,
manicured
hands.
Stretching
his
arms
and
fingers,
he
snatched
the
keystone
from
midair.
Falling
forward
with
the
keystone
victoriously
clutched
in
his
hand,
Teabing
knew
he
was
falling
too
fast.
With
nothing
to
break
his
fall,
his
outstretched
arms
hit
first,
and
the
cryptex
collided
hard
with
the
floor.
There
was
a
sickening
crunch
of
glass
within.
For
a
full
second,
Teabing
did
not
breathe.
Lying
there
outstretched
on
the
cold
floor,
staring
the
length
of
his
outstretched
arms
at
the
marble
cylinder
in
his
bare
palms,
he
implored
the
glass
vial
inside
to
hold.
Then
the
acrid
tang
of
vinegar
cut
the
air,
and
Teabing
felt
the
cool
liquid
flowing
out
through
the
dials
onto
his
palm.
Wild
panic
gripped
him.
NO!
The
vinegar
was
streaming
now,
and
Teabing
pictured
the
papyrus
dissolving
within.
Robert,
you
