realized
that
any
possibility
of
finding
a
way
to
return
the
keystone
to
the
Priory
had
just
evaporated.
News
of
the
three
additional
murders
had
dire
implications.
The
Priory
has
been
infiltrated.
They
are
compromised.
The
brotherhood
was
obviously
being
watched,
or
there
was
a
mole
within
the
ranks.
It
seemed
to
explain
why
Sauniere
might
have
transferred
the
keystone
to
Sophie
and
Langdon
people
outside
the
brotherhood,
people
he
knew
were
not
compromised.
We
can
't
very
well
give
the
keystone
back
to
the
brotherhood.
Even
if
Langdon
had
any
idea
how
to
find
a
Priory
member,
chances
were
good
that
whoever
stepped
forward
to
take
the
keystone
could
be
the
enemy
himself.
For
the
moment,
at
least,
it
seemed
the
keystone
was
in
Sophie
and
Langdon's
hands,
whether
they
wanted
it
or
not.
The
truck's
front
end
looked
worse
than
Langdon
had
imagined.
The
left
headlight
was
gone,
and
the
right
one
looked
like
an
eyeball
dangling
from
its
socket.
Langdon
straightened
it,
and
it
dislodged
again.
The
only
good
news
was
that
the
front
bumper
had
been
torn
almost
clean
off.
Langdon
gave
it
a
hard
kick
and
sensed
he
might
be
able
to
break
it
off
entirely.
As
he
repeatedly
kicked
the
twisted
metal,
Langdon
recalled
his
earlier
conversation
with
Sophie.
My
grandfather
left
me
a
phone
message,
Sophie
had
told
him.
He
said
he
needed
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
my
family.
At
the
time
it
had
meant
nothing,
but
now,
knowing
the
Priory
of
Sion
was
involved,
Langdon
felt
a
startling
new
possibility
emerge.
The
bumper
broke
off
suddenly
with
a
crash.
Langdon
paused
to
catch
his
breath.
At
least
the
truck
would
no
longer
look
like
a
Fourth
of
July
sparkler.
He
grabbed
the
bumper
and
began
dragging
it
out
of
sight
into
the
woods,
wondering
where
they
should
go
next.
They
had
no
idea
how
to
open
the
cryptex,
or
why
Sauniere
had
given
it
to
them.
Unfortunately,
their
survival
tonight
seemed
to
depend
on
getting
answers
to
those
very
questions.
We
need
help,
Langdon
decided.
Professional
help.
In
the
world
of
the
Holy
Grail
and
the
Priory
of
Sion,
that
meant
only
one
man.
The
challenge,
of
course,
would
be
selling
the
idea
to
Sophie.
Inside
the
armored
car,
while
Sophie
waited
for
Langdon
to
return,
she
could
feel
the
weight
of
the
rosewood
box
on
her
lap
and
resented
it.
Why
did
my
grandfather
give
this
to
me
?
She
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
to
do
with
it.
Think,
Sophie!
Use
your
head.
Grand
pere
is
trying
to
tell
you
something!
Opening
the
box,
she
eyed
the
cryptex's
dials.
A
proof
of
merit.
She
could
feel
her
grandfather's
hand
at
work.
The
keystone
is
a
map
that
can
be
followed
only
by
the
worthy.
It
sounded
like
her
grandfather
to
the
core.
Lifting
the
cryptex
out
of
the
box,
Sophie
ran
her
fingers
over
the
dials.
Five
letters.
She
rotated
the
dials
one
by
one.
The
mechanism
