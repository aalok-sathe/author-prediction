than
my
grandfather?"
"I
meant
more
than
anyone
outside
the
brotherhood."
"How
do
you
know
Teabing
isn't
a
member
of
the
brotherhood?"
"Teabing
has
spent
his
life
trying
to
broadcast
the
truth
about
the
Holy
Grail.
The
Priory's
oath
is
to
keep
its
true
nature
hidden.
"Sounds
to
me
like
a
conflict
of
interest."
Langdon
understood
her
concerns.
Sauniere
had
given
the
cryptex
directly
to
Sophie,
and
although
she
didn't
know
what
it
contained
or
what
she
was
supposed
to
do
with
it,
she
was
hesitant
to
involve
a
total
stranger.
Considering
the
information
potentially
enclosed,
the
instinct
was
probably
a
good
one.
"We
don't
need
to
tell
Teabing
about
the
keystone
immediately.
Or
at
all,
even.
His
house
will
give
us
a
place
to
hide
and
think,
and
maybe
when
we
talk
to
him
about
the
Grail,
you'll
start
to
have
an
idea
why
your
grandfather
gave
this
to
you.
"Us,
"
Sophie
reminded.
Langdon
felt
a
humble
pride
and
wondered
yet
again
why
Sauniere
had
included
him.
"Do
you
know
more
or
less
where
Mr.
Teabing
lives?"
Sophie
asked.
"His
estate
is
called
Chateau
Villette."
Sophie
turned
with
an
incredulous
look.
"The
Chateau
Villette?"
"That's
the
one."
"Nice
friends."
"You
know
the
estate?"
"I've
passed
it.
It's
in
the
castle
district.
Twenty
minutes
from
here."
Langdon
frowned.
"That
far?"
"Yes,
which
will
give
you
enough
time
to
tell
me
what
the
Holy
Grail
really
is."
Langdon
paused.
"I'll
tell
you
at
Teabing's.
He
and
I
specialize
in
different
areas
of
the
legend,
so
between
the
two
of
us,
you'll
get
the
full
story."
Langdon
smiled.
"Besides,
the
Grail
has
been
Teabing's
life,
and
hearing
the
story
of
the
Holy
Grail
from
Leigh
Teabing
will
be
like
hearing
the
theory
of
relativity
from
Einstein
himself."
"Let's
hope
Leigh
doesn't
mind
late
night
visitors."
"For
the
record,
it's
Sir
Leigh."
Langdon
had
made
that
mistake
only
once.
"Teabing
is
quite
a
character.
He
was
knighted
by
the
Queen
several
years
back
after
composing
an
extensive
history
on
the
House
of
York."
Sophie
looked
over.
"You're
kidding,
right?
We're
going
to
visit
a
knight?"
Langdon
gave
an
awkward
smile.
"We're
on
a
Grail
quest,
Sophie.
Who
better
to
help
us
than
a
knight?"
The
Sprawling
185
acre
estate
of
Chateau
Villette
was
located
twenty
five
minutes
northwest
of
Paris
in
the
environs
of
Versailles.
Designed
by
Francois
Mansart
in
1668
for
the
Count
of
Aufflay,
it
was
one
of
Paris's
most
significant
historical
chateaux.
Complete
with
two
rectangular
lakes
and
gardens
designed
by
Le
Notre,
Chateau
Villette
was
more
of
a
modest
castle
than
a
mansion.
The
estate
fondly
had
become
known
as
la
Petite
Versailles.
Langdon
brought
the
armored
truck
to
a
shuddering
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
mile
long
driveway.
Beyond
the
imposing
security
gate,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
residence
rose
on
a
meadow
in
the
distance.
The
sign
on
the
gate
was
in
English:
PRIVATE
PROPERTY.
NO
TRESPASSING.
As
if
to
proclaim
his
home
a
British
Isle
unto
