pointed
to
the
hallway.
After
a
moment
of
stunned
silence,
Remy
skulked
out
like
a
banished
dog.
In
the
cool
night
breeze
coming
through
the
open
doors,
Teabing
turned
back
to
Sophie
and
Langdon,
his
expression
still
wary.
"This
better
be
good.
What
do
you
know
of
the
keystone?"
In
the
thick
brush
outside
Teabing's
study,
Silas
clutched
his
pistol
and
gazed
through
the
glass
doors.
Only
moments
ago,
he
had
circled
the
house
and
seen
Langdon
and
the
woman
talking
in
the
large
study.
Before
he
could
move
in,
a
man
on
crutches
entered,
yelled
at
Langdon,
threw
open
the
doors,
and
demanded
his
guests
leave.
Then
the
woman
mentioned
the
keystone,
and
everything
changed.
Shouts
turned
to
whispers.
Moods
softened.
And
the
glass
doors
were
quickly
closed.
Now,
as
he
huddled
in
the
shadows,
Silas
peered
through
the
glass.
The
keystone
is
somewhere
inside
the
house.
Silas
could
feel
it.
Staying
in
the
shadows,
he
inched
closer
to
the
glass,
eager
to
hear
what
was
being
said.
He
would
give
them
five
minutes.
If
they
did
not
reveal
where
they
had
placed
the
keystone,
Silas
would
have
to
enter
and
persuade
them
with
force.
Inside
the
study,
Langdon
could
sense
their
host's
bewilderment.
"Grand
Master?"
Teabing
choked,
eyeing
Sophie.
"Jacques
Sauniere?"
Sophie
nodded,
seeing
the
shock
in
his
eyes.
"But
you
could
not
possibly
know
that!"
"Jacques
Sauniere
was
my
grandfather."
Teabing
staggered
back
on
his
crutches,
shooting
a
glance
at
Langdon,
who
nodded.
Teabing
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
I
am
speechless.
If
this
is
true,
then
I
am
truly
sorry
for
your
loss.
I
should
admit,
for
my
research,
I
have
kept
lists
of
men
in
Paris
whom
I
thought
might
be
good
candidates
for
involvement
in
the
Priory.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
on
that
list
along
with
many
others.
But
Grand
Master,
you
say?
It's
hard
to
fathom."
Teabing
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
shook
his
head.
"But
it
still
makes
no
sense.
Even
if
your
grandfather
were
the
Priory
Grand
Master
and
created
the
keystone
himself,
he
would
never
tell
you
how
to
find
it.
The
keystone
reveals
the
pathway
to
the
brotherhood's
ultimate
treasure.
Granddaughter
or
not,
you
are
not
eligible
to
receive
such
knowledge."
"Mr.
Sauniere
was
dying
when
he
passed
on
the
information,"
Langdon
said.
"He
had
limited
options."
"He
didn't
need
options,"
Teabing
argued.
"There
exist
three
senechaux
who
also
know
the
secret.
That
is
the
beauty
of
their
system.
One
will
rise
to
Grand
Master
and
they
will
induct
a
new
senechal
and
share
the
secret
of
the
keystone."
"I
guess
you
didn't
see
the
entire
news
broadcast,"
Sophie
said.
"In
addition
to
my
grandfather,
three
other
prominent
Parisians
were
murdered
today.
All
in
similar
ways.
All
looked
like
they
had
been
interrogated."
Teabing's
jaw
fell.
"And
you
think
they
were"
"The
senechaux,
"
Langdon
said.
"But
how?
A
murderer
could
not
possibly
learn
the
identities
of
all
four
top
members
of
the
Priory
of
Sion!
