of
the
ordinary.
Not
on
the
floor,
on
the
walls,
or
even
on
the
canvas
itself.
There
must
be
something
here!
Sophie
felt
totally
certain
she
had
deciphered
her
grandfather's
intentions
correctly.
What
else
could
he
possibly
intend?
The
masterpiece
she
was
examining
was
a
five
foot
tall
canvas.
The
bizarre
scene
Da
Vinci
had
painted
included
an
awkwardly
posed
Virgin
Mary
sitting
with
Baby
Jesus,
John
the
Baptist,
and
the
Angel
Uriel
on
a
perilous
outcropping
of
rocks.
When
Sophie
was
a
little
girl,
no
trip
to
the
Mona
Lisa
had
been
complete
without
her
grandfather
dragging
her
across
the
room
to
see
this
second
painting.
Grand
pere,
I'm
here!
But
I
don
't
see
it!
Behind
her,
Sophie
could
hear
the
guard
trying
to
radio
again
for
help.
Think!
She
pictured
the
message
scrawled
on
the
protective
glass
of
the
Mona
Lisa.
So
dark
the
con
of
man.
The
painting
before
her
had
no
protective
glass
on
which
to
write
a
message,
and
Sophie
knew
her
grandfather
would
never
have
defaced
this
masterpiece
by
writing
on
the
painting
itself.
She
paused.
At
least
not
on
the
front.
Her
eyes
shot
upward,
climbing
the
long
cables
that
dangled
from
the
ceiling
to
support
the
canvas.
Could
that
be
it?
Grabbing
the
left
side
of
the
carved
wood
frame,
she
pulled
it
toward
her.
The
painting
was
large
and
the
backing
flexed
as
she
swung
it
away
from
the
wall.
Sophie
slipped
her
head
and
shoulders
in
behind
the
painting
and
raised
the
black
light
to
inspect
the
back.
It
took
only
seconds
to
realize
her
instinct
had
been
wrong.
The
back
of
the
painting
was
pale
and
blank.
There
was
no
purple
text
here,
only
the
mottled
brown
backside
of
aging
canvas
and
Wait.
Sophie's
eyes
locked
on
an
incongruous
glint
of
lustrous
metal
lodged
near
the
bottom
edge
of
the
frame's
wooden
armature.
The
object
was
small,
partially
wedged
in
the
slit
where
the
canvas
met
the
frame.
A
shimmering
gold
chain
dangled
off
it.
To
Sophie's
utter
amazement,
the
chain
was
affixed
to
a
familiar
gold
key.
The
broad,
sculpted
head
was
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
and
bore
an
engraved
seal
she
had
not
seen
since
she
was
nine
years
old.
A
fleur
de
lis
with
the
initials
P.S.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
felt
the
ghost
of
her
grandfather
whispering
in
her
ear.
When
the
time
comes,
the
key
will
be
yours.
A
tightness
gripped
her
throat
as
she
realized
that
her
grandfather,
even
in
death,
had
kept
his
promise.
This
key
opens
a
box,
his
voice
was
saying,
where
I
keep
many
secrets.
Sophie
now
realized
that
the
entire
purpose
of
tonight's
word
game
had
been
this
key.
Her
grandfather
had
it
with
him
when
he
was
killed.
Not
wanting
it
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police,
he
hid
it
behind
this
painting.
Then
he
devised
an
ingenious
treasure
hunt
to
ensure
only
Sophie
would
find
it.
"Au
secours!"
the
guard's
voice
