stupid
multitude.
LEONARDO
DA
VINCI
"Here's
another,"
Teabing
said,
pointing
to
a
different
quote.
Blinding
ignorance
does
mislead
us.
01
Wretched
mortals,
open
your
eyes!
LEONARDO
DA
VINCI
Sophie
felt
a
little
chill.
"Da
Vinci
is
talking
about
the
Bible?"
Teabing
nodded.
"Leonardo's
feelings
about
the
Bible
relate
directly
to
the
Holy
Grail.
In
fact,
Da
Vinci
painted
the
true
Grail,
which
I
will
show
you
momentarily,
but
first
we
must
speak
of
the
Bible."
Teabing
smiled.
"And
everything
you
need
to
know
about
the
Bible
can
be
summed
up
by
the
great
canon
doctor
Martyn
Percy."
Teabing
cleared
his
throat
and
declared,
"The
Bible
did
not
arrive
by
fax
from
heaven."
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"The
Bible
is
a
product
of
man,
my
dear.
Not
of
God.
The
Bible
did
not
fall
magically
from
the
clouds.
Man
created
it
as
a
historical
record
of
tumultuous
times,
and
it
has
evolved
through
countless
translations,
additions,
and
revisions.
History
has
never
had
a
definitive
version
of
the
book."
"Okay."
"Jesus
Christ
was
a
historical
figure
of
staggering
influence,
perhaps
the
most
enigmatic
and
inspirational
leader
the
world
has
ever
seen.
As
the
prophesied
Messiah,
Jesus
toppled
kings,
inspired
millions,
and
founded
new
philosophies.
As
a
descendant
of
the
lines
of
King
Solomon
and
King
David,
Jesus
possessed
a
rightful
claim
to
the
throne
of
the
King
of
the
Jews.
Understandably,
His
life
was
recorded
by
thousands
of
followers
across
the
land."
Teabing
paused
to
sip
his
tea
and
then
placed
the
cup
back
on
the
mantel.
"More
than
eighty
gospels
were
considered
for
the
New
Testament,
and
yet
only
a
relative
few
were
chosen
for
inclusion
Matthew,
Mark,
Luke,
and
John
among
them.
"Who
chose
which
gospels
to
include?"
Sophie
asked.
"Aha!"
Teabing
burst
in
with
enthusiasm.
"The
fundamental
irony
of
Christianity!
The
Bible,
as
we
know
it
today,
was
collated
by
the
pagan
Roman
emperor
Constantine
the
Great."
"I
thought
Constantine
was
a
Christian,"
Sophie
said.
"Hardly,"
Teabing
scoffed.
"He
was
a
lifelong
pagan
who
was
baptized
on
his
deathbed,
too
weak
to
protest.
In
Constantine's
day,
Rome's
official
religion
was
sun
worship
the
cult
of
Sol
Invictus,
or
the
Invincible
Sun
and
Constantine
was
its
head
priest.
Unfortunately
for
him,
a
growing
religious
turmoil
was
gripping
Rome.
Three
centuries
after
the
crucifixion
of
Jesus
Christ,
Christ's
followers
had
multiplied
exponentially.
Christians
and
pagans
began
warring,
and
the
conflict
grew
to
such
proportions
that
it
threatened
to
rend
Rome
in
two.
Constantine
decided
something
had
to
be
done.
In
325
A.D.,
he
decided
to
unify
Rome
under
a
single
religion.
Christianity."
Sophie
was
surprised.
"Why
would
a
pagan
emperor
choose
Christianity
as
the
official
religion?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"Constantine
was
a
very
good
businessman.
He
could
see
that
Christianity
was
on
the
rise,
and
he
simply
backed
the
winning
horse.
Historians
still
marvel
at
the
brilliance
with
which
Constantine
converted
the
sun
worshipping
pagans
to
Christianity.
By
fusing
pagan
symbols,
dates,
and
rituals
into
the
growing
Christian
tradition,
he
created
