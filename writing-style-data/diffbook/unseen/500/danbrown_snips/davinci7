didn't
slow.
The
agent
gunned
the
sedan
across
the
junction
and
sped
onto
a
wooded
section
of
Rue
Castiglione,
which
served
as
the
northern
entrance
to
the
famed
Tuileries
Gardens
Paris's
own
version
of
Central
Park.
Most
tourists
mistranslated
Jardins
des
Tuileries
as
relating
to
the
thousands
of
tulips
that
bloomed
here,
but
Tuileries
was
actually
a
literal
reference
to
something
far
less
romantic.
This
park
had
once
been
an
enormous,
polluted
excavation
pit
from
which
Parisian
contractors
mined
clay
to
manufacture
the
city's
famous
red
roofing
tiles
or
tuiles.
As
they
entered
the
deserted
park,
the
agent
reached
under
the
dash
and
turned
off
the
blaring
siren.
Langdon
exhaled,
savoring
the
sudden
quiet.
Outside
the
car,
the
pale
wash
of
halogen
headlights
skimmed
over
the
crushed
gravel
parkway,
the
rugged
whir
of
the
tires
intoning
a
hypnotic
rhythm.
Langdon
had
always
considered
the
Tuileries
to
be
sacred
ground.
These
were
the
gardens
in
which
Claude
Monet
had
experimented
with
form
and
color,
and
literally
inspired
the
birth
of
the
Impressionist
movement.
Tonight,
however,
this
place
held
a
strange
aura
of
foreboding.
The
Citroen
swerved
left
now,
angling
west
down
the
park's
central
boulevard.
Curling
around
a
circular
pond,
the
driver
cut
across
a
desolate
avenue
out
into
a
wide
quadrangle
beyond.
Langdon
could
now
see
the
end
of
the
Tuileries
Gardens,
marked
by
a
giant
stone
archway.
Arc
du
Carrousel.
Despite
the
orgiastic
rituals
once
held
at
the
Arc
du
Carrousel,
art
aficionados
revered
this
place
for
another
reason
entirely.
From
the
esplanade
at
the
end
of
the
Tuileries,
four
of
the
finest
art
museums
in
the
world
could
be
seen
one
at
each
point
of
the
compass.
Out
the
right
hand
window,
south
across
the
Seine
and
Quai
Voltaire,
Langdon
could
see
the
dramatically
lit
facade
of
the
old
train
station
now
the
esteemed
Musee
d'Orsay.
Glancing
left,
he
could
make
out
the
top
of
the
ultramodern
Pompidou
Center,
which
housed
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art.
Behind
him
to
the
west,
Langdon
knew
the
ancient
obelisk
of
Ramses
rose
above
the
trees,
marking
the
Musee
du
Jeu
de
Paume.
But
it
was
straight
ahead,
to
the
east,
through
the
archway,
that
Langdon
could
now
see
the
monolithic
Renaissance
palace
that
had
become
the
most
famous
art
museum
in
the
world.
Musee
du
Louvre.
Langdon
felt
a
familiar
tinge
of
wonder
as
his
eyes
made
a
futile
attempt
to
absorb
the
entire
mass
of
the
edifice.
Across
a
staggeringly
expansive
plaza,
the
imposing
facade
of
the
Louvre
rose
like
a
citadel
against
the
Paris
sky.
Shaped
like
an
enormous
horseshoe,
the
Louvre
was
the
longest
building
in
Europe,
stretching
farther
than
three
Eiffel
Towers
laid
end
to
end.
Not
even
the
million
square
feet
of
open
plaza
between
the
museum
wings
could
challenge
the
majesty
of
the
facade's
breadth.
Langdon
had
once
walked
the
Louvre's
entire
perimeter,
an
astonishing
three
mile
journey.
Despite
the
estimated
five
days
it
would
take
a
visitor
to
properly
appreciate
the
65,300
pieces
of
