elegant
storefronts
on
Champs
Ely
sees.
"How
much
cash
do
you
have?"
Langdon
checked
his
wallet.
"A
hundred
dollars.
A
few
euro.
Why?"
"Credit
cards?"
"Of
course."
As
Sophie
accelerated,
Langdon
sensed
she
was
formulating
a
plan.
Dead
ahead,
at
the
end
of
Champs
Elysees,
stood
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
Napoleon's
164
foot
tall
tribute
to
his
own
military
potency
encircled
by
France's
largest
rotary,
a
nine
lane
behemoth.
Sophie's
eyes
were
on
the
rearview
mirror
again
as
they
approached
the
rotary.
"We
lost
them
for
the
time
being,"
she
said,
"but
we
won't
last
another
five
minutes
if
we
stay
in
this
car."
So
steal
a
different
one,
Langdon
mused,
now
that
we're
criminals.
"What
are
you
going
to
do?"
Sophie
gunned
the
SmartCar
into
the
rotary.
"Trust
me."
Langdon
made
no
response.
Trust
had
not
gotten
him
very
far
this
evening.
Pulling
back
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket,
he
checked
his
watch
a
vintage,
collector's
edition
Mickey
Mouse
wristwatch
that
had
been
a
gift
from
his
parents
on
his
tenth
birthday.
Although
its
juvenile
dial
often
drew
odd
looks,
Langdon
had
never
owned
any
other
watch;
Disney
animations
had
been
his
first
introduction
to
the
magic
of
form
and
color,
and
Mickey
now
served
as
Langdon's
daily
reminder
to
stay
young
at
heart.
At
the
moment,
however,
Mickey's
arms
were
skewed
at
an
awkward
angle,
indicating
an
equally
awkward
hour.
2:51A.M.
"Interesting
watch,"
Sophie
said,
glancing
at
his
wrist
and
maneuvering
the
SmartCar
around
the
wide,
counterclockwise
rotary.
"Long
story,"
he
said,
pulling
his
sleeve
back
down.
"I
imagine
it
would
have
to
be."
She
gave
him
a
quick
smile
and
exited
the
rotary,
heading
due
north,
away
from
the
city
center.
Barely
making
two
green
lights,
she
reached
the
third
intersection
and
took
a
hard
right
onto
Boulevard
Malesherbes.
They'd
left
the
rich,
tree
lined
streets
of
the
diplomatic
neighborhood
and
plunged
into
a
darker
industrial
neighborhood.
Sophie
took
a
quick
left,
and
a
moment
later,
Langdon
realized
where
they
were.
Gare
Saint
Lazare.
Ahead
of
them,
the
glass
roofed
train
terminal
resembled
the
awkward
offspring
of
an
airplane
hangar
and
a
greenhouse.
European
train
stations
never
slept.
Even
at
this
hour,
a
half
dozen
taxis
idled
near
the
main
entrance.
Vendors
manned
carts
of
sandwiches
and
mineral
water
while
grungy
kids
in
backpacks
emerged
from
the
station
rubbing
their
eyes,
looking
around
as
if
trying
to
remember
what
city
they
were
in
now.
Up
ahead
on
the
street,
a
couple
of
city
policemen
stood
on
the
curb
giving
directions
to
some
confused
tourists.
Sophie
pulled
her
SmartCar
in
behind
the
line
of
taxis
and
parked
in
a
red
zone
despite
plenty
of
legal
parking
across
the
street.
Before
Langdon
could
ask
what
was
going
on,
she
was
out
of
the
car.
She
hurried
to
the
window
of
the
taxi
in
front
of
them
and
began
speaking
to
the
driver.
As
Langdon
got
out
of
the
SmartCar,
he
saw
Sophie
hand
the
taxi
driver
a
big
wad
