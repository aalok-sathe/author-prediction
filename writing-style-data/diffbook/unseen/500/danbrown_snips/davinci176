you
be
so
kind
as
to
hand
me
that
phone?"
Teabing
pointed
to
the
car
phone
on
the
dash.
Langdon
handed
it
back,
and
Teabing
dialed
a
number.
He
waited
for
a
very
long
time
before
someone
answered.
"Richard?
Did
I
wake
you?
Of
course,
I
did.
Silly
question.
I'm
sorry.
I
have
a
small
problem.
I'm
feeling
a
bit
off.
Remy
and
I
need
to
pop
up
to
the
Isles
for
my
treatments.
Well,
right
away,
actually.
Sorry
for
the
short
notice.
Can
you
have
Elizabeth
ready
in
about
twenty
minutes?
I
know,
do
the
best
you
can.
See
you
shortly."
He
hung
up.
"Elizabeth?"
Langdon
said.
"My
plane.
She
cost
me
a
Queen's
ransom."
Langdon
turned
full
around
and
looked
at
him.
"What?"
Teabing
demanded.
"You
two
can't
expect
to
stay
in
France
with
the
entire
Judicial
Police
after
you.
London
will
be
much
safer."
Sophie
had
turned
to
Teabing
as
well.
"You
think
we
should
leave
the
country?"
"My
friends,
I
am
far
more
influential
in
the
civilized
world
than
here
in
France.
Furthermore,
the
Grail
is
believed
to
be
in
Great
Britain.
If
we
unlock
the
keystone,
I
am
certain
we
will
discover
a
map
that
indicates
we
have
moved
in
the
proper
direction."
"You're
running
a
big
risk,"
Sophie
said,
"by
helping
us.
You
won't
make
any
friends
with
the
French
police."
Teabing
gave
a
wave
of
disgust.
"I
am
finished
with
France.
I
moved
here
to
find
the
keystone.
That
work
is
now
done.
I
shan't
care
if
I
ever
again
see
Chateau
Villette."
Sophie
sounded
uncertain.
"How
will
we
get
through
airport
security?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"I
fly
from
Le
Bourget
an
executive
airfield
not
far
from
here.
French
doctors
make
me
nervous,
so
every
fortnight,
I
fly
north
to
take
my
treatments
in
England.
I
pay
for
certain
special
privileges
at
both
ends.
Once
we're
airborne,
you
can
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
you'd
like
someone
from
the
U.S.
Embassy
to
meet
us."
Langdon
suddenly
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
the
embassy.
All
he
could
think
of
was
the
keystone,
the
inscription,
and
whether
it
would
all
lead
to
the
Grail.
He
wondered
if
Teabing
was
right
about
Britain.
Admittedly
most
modern
legends
placed
the
Grail
somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom.
Even
King
Arthur's
mythical,
Grail
rich
Isle
of
Avalon
was
now
believed
to
be
none
other
than
Glastonbury,
England.
Wherever
the
Grail
lay,
Langdon
never
imagined
he
would
actually
be
looking
for
it.
The
Sangreal
documents.
The
true
history
of
Jesus
Christ.
The
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene.
He
suddenly
felt
as
if
he
were
living
in
some
kind
of
limbo
tonight
a
bubble
where
the
real
world
could
not
reach
him.
"Sir?"
Remy
said.
"Are
you
truly
thinking
of
returning
to
England
for
good?"
"Remy,
you
needn't
worry,"
Teabing
assured.
"Just
because
I
am
returning
to
the
Queen's
realm
does
not
mean
I
intend
to
subject
my
palate
to
bangers
and
mash
for
the
rest
of
my
days.
