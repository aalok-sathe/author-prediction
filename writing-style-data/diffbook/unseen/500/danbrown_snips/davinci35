frightened.
The
young
priest
was
smiling
as
he
entered.
His
nose
was
awkwardly
bandaged,
and
he
was
holding
out
an
old
Bible.
"I
found
one
in
French
for
you.
The
chapter
is
marked."
Uncertain,
the
ghost
took
the
Bible
and
looked
at
the
chapter
the
priest
had
marked.
Acts
16.
The
verses
told
of
a
prisoner
named
Silas
who
lay
naked
and
beaten
in
his
cell,
singing
hymns
to
God.
When
the
ghost
reached
Verse
26,
he
gasped
in
shock.
"
And
suddenly,
there
was
a
great
earthquake,
so
that
the
foundations
of
the
prison
were
shaken,
and
all
the
doors
fell
open.
His
eyes
shot
up
at
the
priest.
The
priest
smiled
warmly.
"From
now
on,
my
friend,
if
you
have
no
other
name,
I
shall
call
you
Silas."
The
ghost
nodded
blankly.
Silas.
He
had
been
given
flesh.
My
name
is
Silas.
"It's
time
for
breakfast,"
the
priest
said.
"You
will
need
your
strength
if
you
are
to
help
me
build
this
church."
Twenty
thousand
feet
above
the
Mediterranean,
Alitalia
flight
1618
bounced
in
turbulence,
causing
passengers
to
shift
nervously.
Bishop
Aringarosa
barely
noticed.
His
thoughts
were
with
the
future
of
Opus
Dei.
Eager
to
know
how
plans
in
Paris
were
progressing,
he
wished
he
could
phone
Silas.
But
he
could
not.
The
Teacher
had
seen
to
that.
"It
is
for
your
own
safety,"
the
Teacher
had
explained,
speaking
in
English
with
a
French
accent.
"I
am
familiar
enough
with
electronic
communications
to
know
they
can
be
intercepted.
The
results
could
be
disastrous
for
you.
Aringarosa
knew
he
was
right.
The
Teacher
seemed
an
exceptionally
careful
man.
He
had
not
revealed
his
own
identity
to
Aringarosa,
and
yet
he
had
proven
himself
a
man
well
worth
obeying.
After
all,
he
had
somehow
obtained
very
secret
information.
The
names
of
the
brotherhood'
s
four
top
members!
This
had
been
one
of
the
coups
that
convinced
the
bishop
the
Teacher
was
truly
capable
of
delivering
the
astonishing
prize
he
claimed
he
could
unearth.
"Bishop,"
the
Teacher
had
told
him,
"I
have
made
all
the
arrangements.
For
my
plan
to
succeed,
you
must
allow
Silas
to
answer
only
to
me
for
several
days.
The
two
of
you
will
not
speak.
I
will
communicate
with
him
through
secure
channels."
"You
will
treat
him
with
respect?"
"A
man
of
faith
deserves
the
highest."
"Excellent.
Then
I
understand.
Silas
and
I
shall
not
speak
until
this
is
over."
"I
do
this
to
protect
your
identity,
Silas's
identity,
and
my
investment."
"Your
investment?"
"Bishop,
if
your
own
eagerness
to
keep
abreast
of
progress
puts
you
in
jail,
then
you
will
be
unable
to
pay
me
my
fee."
The
bishop
smiled.
"A
fine
point.
Our
desires
are
in
accord.
Godspeed."
Twenty
million
euro,
the
bishop
thought,
now
gazing
out
the
plane's
window.
The
sum
was
approximately
the
same
number
of
U.S.
dollars.
A
pittance
for
something
so
powerful.
He
felt
a
renewed
confidence
that
the
Teacher
and
Silas
would
not
fail.
Money
and
faith
were
powerful
