He
did
this
to
himself.
"Mr.
Langdon?"
Fache's
dark
eyes
settled
on
him
again.
"It's
a
pentacle,"
Langdon
offered,
his
voice
feeling
hollow
in
the
huge
space.
"One
of
the
oldest
symbols
on
earth.
Used
over
four
thousand
years
before
Christ."
"And
what
does
it
mean?"
Langdon
always
hesitated
when
he
got
this
question.
Telling
someone
what
a
symbol
"meant"
was
like
telling
them
how
a
song
should
make
them
feel
it
was
different
for
all
people.
A
white
Ku
Klux
Klan
headpiece
conjured
images
of
hatred
and
racism
in
the
United
States,
and
yet
the
same
costume
carried
a
meaning
of
religious
faith
in
Spain.
"Symbols
carry
different
meanings
in
different
settings,"
Langdon
said.
"Primarily,
the
pentacle
is
a
pagan
religious
symbol."
Fache
nodded.
"Devil
worship."
"No,"
Langdon
corrected,
immediately
realizing
his
choice
of
vocabulary
should
have
been
clearer.
Nowadays,
the
term
pagan
had
become
almost
synonymous
with
devil
worship
a
gross
misconception.
The
word's
roots
actually
reached
back
to
the
Latin
paganus,
meaning
country
dwellers.
"Pagans"
were
literally
unindoctrinated
country
folk
who
clung
to
the
old,
rural
religions
of
Nature
worship.
In
fact,
so
strong
was
the
Church's
fear
of
those
who
lived
in
the
rural
villes
that
the
once
innocuous
word
for
"villager"
villain
came
to
mean
a
wicked
soul.
"The
pentacle,"
Langdon
clarified,
"is
a
pre
Christian
symbol
that
relates
to
Nature
worship.
The
ancients
envisioned
their
world
in
two
halves
masculine
and
feminine.
Their
gods
and
goddesses
worked
to
keep
a
balance
of
power.
Yin
and
yang.
When
male
and
female
were
balanced,
there
was
harmony
in
the
world.
When
they
were
unbalanced,
there
was
chaos."
Langdon
motioned
to
Sauniere's
stomach.
"This
pentacle
is
representative
of
the
female
half
of
all
things
a
concept
religious
historians
call
the
'sacred
feminine'
or
the
'divine
goddess.'
Sauniere,
of
all
people,
would
know
this."
"Sauniere
drew
a
goddess
symbol
on
his
stomach?"
Langdon
had
to
admit,
it
seemed
odd.
"In
its
most
specific
interpretation,
the
pentacle
symbolizes
Venus
the
goddess
of
female
sexual
love
and
beauty."
Fache
eyed
the
naked
man,
and
grunted.
"Early
religion
was
based
on
the
divine
order
of
Nature.
The
goddess
Venus
and
the
planet
Venus
were
one
and
the
same.
The
goddess
had
a
place
in
the
nighttime
sky
and
was
known
by
many
names
Venus,
the
Eastern
Star,
Ishtar,
Astarte
all
of
them
powerful
female
concepts
with
ties
to
Nature
and
Mother
Earth.
Fache
looked
more
troubled
now,
as
if
he
somehow
preferred
the
idea
of
devil
worship.
Langdon
decided
not
to
share
the
pentacle's
most
astonishing
property
the
graphic
origin
of
its
ties
to
Venus.
As
a
young
astronomy
student,
Langdon
had
been
stunned
to
learn
the
planet
Venus
traced
a
perfect
pentacle
across
the
ecliptic
sky
every
four
years.
So
astonished
were
the
ancients
to
observe
this
phenomenon,
that
Venus
and
her
pentacle
became
symbols
of
perfection,
beauty,
and
the
cyclic
qualities
of
sexual
love.
As
a
tribute
to
the
magic
of
Venus,
the
Greeks
used
her
four
year
cycle
