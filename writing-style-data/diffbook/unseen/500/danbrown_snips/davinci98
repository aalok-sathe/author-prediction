until
they
confessed
their
crimes
against
God.
Clement's
Machiavellian
operation
came
off
with
clockwork
precision.
On
that
day,
countless
Knights
were
captured,
tortured
mercilessly,
and
finally
burned
at
the
stake
as
heretics.
Echoes
of
the
tragedy
still
resonated
in
modern
culture;
to
this
day,
Friday
the
thirteenth
was
considered
unlucky.
Sophie
looked
confused.
"The
Knights
Templar
were
obliterated?
I
thought
fraternities
of
Templars
still
exist
today?"
"They
do,
under
a
variety
of
names.
Despite
Clement's
false
charges
and
best
efforts
to
eradicate
them,
the
Knights
had
powerful
allies,
and
some
managed
to
escape
the
Vatican
purges.
The
Templars'
potent
treasure
trove
of
documents,
which
had
apparently
been
their
source
of
power,
was
Clement's
true
objective,
but
it
slipped
through
his
fingers.
The
documents
had
long
since
been
entrusted
to
the
Templars'
shadowy
architects,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
whose
veil
of
secrecy
had
kept
them
safely
out
of
range
of
the
Vatican's
onslaught.
As
the
Vatican
closed
in,
the
Priory
smuggled
their
documents
from
a
Paris
preceptory
by
night
onto
Templar
ships
in
La
Rochelle."
"Where
did
the
documents
go?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"That
mystery's
answer
is
known
only
to
the
Priory
of
Sion.
Because
the
documents
remain
the
source
of
constant
investigation
and
speculation
even
today,
they
are
believed
to
have
been
moved
and
rehidden
several
times.
Current
speculation
places
the
documents
somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom."
Sophie
looked
uneasy.
"For
a
thousand
years,"
Langdon
continued,
"legends
of
this
secret
have
been
passed
on.
The
entire
collection
of
documents,
its
power,
and
the
secret
it
reveals
have
become
known
by
a
single
name
Sangreal.
Hundreds
of
books
have
been
written
about
it,
and
few
mysteries
have
caused
as
much
interest
among
historians
as
the
Sangreal."
"The
Sangreal?
Does
the
word
have
anything
to
do
with
the
French
word
sang
or
Spanish
sangre
meaning
'blood'?"
Langdon
nodded.
Blood
was
the
backbone
of
the
Sangreal,
and
yet
not
in
the
way
Sophie
probably
imagined.
"The
legend
is
complicated,
but
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
Priory
guards
the
proof,
and
is
purportedly
awaiting
the
right
moment
in
history
to
reveal
the
truth."
"What
truth?
What
secret
could
possibly
be
that
powerful?"
Langdon
took
a
deep
breath
and
gazed
out
at
the
underbelly
of
Paris
leering
in
the
shadows.
"Sophie,
the
word
Sangreal
is
an
ancient
word.
It
has
evolved
over
the
years
into
another
term
a
more
modern
name."
He
paused.
"When
I
tell
you
its
modern
name,
you'll
realize
you
already
know
a
lot
about
it.
In
fact,
almost
everyone
on
earth
has
heard
the
story
of
the
Sangreal."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"I've
never
heard
of
it."
"Sure
you
have."
Langdon
smiled.
"You're
just
used
to
hearing
it
called
by
the
name
'Holy
Grail.'
Sophie
scrutinized
Langdon
in
the
back
of
the
taxi.
He's
joking.
"The
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
nodded,
his
expression
serious.
"Holy
Grail
is
the
literal
meaning
of
Sangreal.
The
phrase
derives
from
the
French
Sangraal,
which
evolved
to
Sangreal,
and
was
eventually
split
into
two
words,
San
