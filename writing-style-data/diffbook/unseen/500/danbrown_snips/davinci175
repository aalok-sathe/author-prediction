Remy,"
Teabing
chimed
happily.
"The
lights
are
on.
Our
lives
are
in
your
hands."
"Where
are
we
going?"
Sophie
asked.
"This
trail
continues
about
three
kilometers
into
the
forest,"
Teabing
said.
"Cutting
across
the
estate
and
then
arching
north.
Provided
we
don't
hit
any
standing
water
or
fallen
trees,
we
shall
emerge
unscathed
on
the
shoulder
of
highway
five."
Unscathed.
Langdon's
head
begged
to
differ.
He
turned
his
eyes
down
to
his
own
lap,
where
the
keystone
was
safely
stowed
in
its
wooden
box.
The
inlaid
Rose
on
the
lid
was
back
in
place,
and
although
his
head
felt
muddled,
Langdon
was
eager
to
remove
the
inlay
again
and
examine
the
engraving
beneath
more
closely.
He
unlatched
the
lid
and
began
to
raise
it
when
Teabing
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
from
behind.
"Patience,
Robert,"
Teabing
said.
"It's
bumpy
and
dark.
God
save
us
if
we
break
anything.
If
you
didn't
recognize
the
language
in
the
light,
you
won't
do
any
better
in
the
dark.
Let's
focus
on
getting
away
in
one
piece,
shall
we?
There
will
be
time
for
that
very
soon."
Langdon
knew
Teabing
was
right.
With
a
nod,
he
relatched
the
box.
The
monk
in
back
was
moaning
now,
struggling
against
his
trusses.
Suddenly,
he
began
kicking
wildly.
Teabing
spun
around
and
aimed
the
pistol
over
the
seat.
"I
can't
imagine
your
complaint,
sir.
You
trespassed
in
my
home
and
planted
a
nasty
welt
on
the
skull
of
a
dear
friend.
I
would
be
well
within
my
rights
to
shoot
you
right
now
and
leave
you
to
rot
in
the
woods."
The
monk
fell
silent.
"Are
you
sure
we
should
have
brought
him?"
Langdon
asked.
"Bloody
well
positive!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"You're
wanted
for
murder,
Robert.
This
scoundrel
is
your
ticket
to
freedom.
The
police
apparently
want
you
badly
enough
to
have
tailed
you
to
my
home."
"My
fault,"
Sophie
said.
"The
armored
car
probably
had
a
transmitter."
"Not
the
point,"
Teabing
said.
"I'm
not
surprised
the
police
found
you,
but
I
am
surprised
that
this
Opus
Dei
character
found
you.
From
all
you've
told
me,
I
can't
imagine
how
this
man
could
have
tailed
you
to
my
home
unless
he
had
a
contact
either
within
the
Judicial
Police
or
within
the
Zurich
Depository."
Langdon
considered
it.
Bezu
Fache
certainly
seemed
intent
on
finding
a
scapegoat
for
tonight's
murders.
And
Vernet
had
turned
on
them
rather
suddenly,
although
considering
Langdon
was
being
charged
with
four
murders,
the
banker's
change
of
heart
seemed
understandable.
"This
monk
is
not
working
alone,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
"and
until
you
learn
who
is
behind
all
this,
you
both
are
in
danger.
The
good
news,
my
friend,
is
that
you
are
now
in
the
position
of
power.
This
monster
behind
me
holds
that
information,
and
whoever
is
pulling
his
strings
has
got
to
be
quite
nervous
right
now."
Remy
was
picking
up
speed,
getting
comfortable
with
the
trail.
They
splashed
through
some
water,
climbed
a
small
rise,
and
began
descending
again.
"Robert,
could
