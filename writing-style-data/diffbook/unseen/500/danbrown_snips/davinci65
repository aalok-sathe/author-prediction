grave.
The
Mona
Lisa.
She
reached
for
the
huge
wooden
doors,
and
pushed.
The
entryway
yawned
open.
Sophie
stood
on
the
threshold
a
moment,
scanning
the
large
rectangular
chamber
beyond.
It
too
was
bathed
in
a
soft
red
light.
The
Salle
des
Etats
was
one
of
this
museum's
rare
culs
de
sac
a
dead
end
and
the
only
room
off
the
middle
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
This
door,
the
chamber's
sole
point
of
entry,
faced
a
dominating
fifteen
foot
Botticelli
on
the
far
wall.
Beneath
it,
centered
on
the
parquet
floor,
an
immense
octagonal
viewing
divan
served
as
a
welcome
respite
for
thousands
of
visitors
to
rest
their
legs
while
they
admired
the
Louvre's
most
valuable
asset.
Even
before
Sophie
entered,
though,
she
knew
she
was
missing
something.
A
black
light.
She
gazed
down
the
hall
at
her
grandfather
under
the
lights
in
the
distance,
surrounded
by
electronic
gear.
If
he
had
written
anything
in
here,
he
almost
certainly
would
have
written
it
with
the
watermark
stylus.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
Sophie
hurried
down
to
the
well
lit
crime
scene.
Unable
to
look
at
her
grandfather,
she
focused
solely
on
the
PTS
tools.
Finding
a
small
ultraviolet
penlight,
she
slipped
it
in
the
pocket
of
her
sweater
and
hurried
back
up
the
hallway
toward
the
open
doors
of
the
Salle
des
Etats.
Sophie
turned
the
corner
and
stepped
over
the
threshold.
Her
entrance,
however,
was
met
by
an
unexpected
sound
of
muffled
footsteps
racing
toward
her
from
inside
the
chamber.
There
's
someone
in
here!
A
ghostly
figure
emerged
suddenly
from
out
of
the
reddish
haze.
Sophie
jumped
back.
"There
you
are!"
Langdon's
hoarse
whisper
cut
the
air
as
his
silhouette
slid
to
a
stop
in
front
of
her.
Her
relief
was
only
momentary.
"Robert,
I
told
you
to
get
out
of
here!
If
Fache
"Where
were
you?"
"I
had
to
get
the
black
light,"
she
whispered,
holding
it
up.
"If
my
grandfather
left
me
a
message
"Sophie,
listen."
Langdon
caught
his
breath
as
his
blue
eyes
held
her
firmly.
"The
letters
P.S.
do
they
mean
anything
else
to
you?
Anything
at
all?"
Afraid
their
voices
might
echo
down
the
hall,
Sophie
pulled
him
into
the
Salle
des
Etats
and
closed
the
enormous
twin
doors
silently,
sealing
them
inside.
"I
told
you,
the
initials
mean
Princess
Sophie."
"I
know,
but
did
you
ever
see
them
anywhere
else?
Did
your
grandfather
ever
use
P.S.
in
any
other
way?
As
a
monogram,
or
maybe
on
stationery
or
a
personal
item?"
The
question
startled
her.
How
would
Robert
know
that?
Sophie
had
indeed
seen
the
initials
P.S.
once
before,
in
a
kind
of
monogram.
It
was
the
day
before
her
ninth
birthday.
She
was
secretly
combing
the
house,
searching
for
hidden
birthday
presents.
Even
then,
she
could
not
bear
secrets
kept
from
her.
What
did
Grand
pere
get
for
me
this
year?
She
dug
through
cupboards
and
drawers.
Did
he
get
me
the
doll
I
wanted?
Where
would
he
hide
it?
Finding
nothing
