inside
the
Grand
Gallery."
"Inside?
But
what
is
he
doing?"
"Is
the
Louvre
security
guard
armed?"
"Yes,
sir.
He's
a
senior
warden."
"Send
him
in,"
Fache
commanded.
"I
can't
get
my
men
back
to
the
perimeter
for
a
few
minutes,
and
I
don't
want
Langdon
breaking
for
an
exit."
Fache
paused.
"And
you'd
better
tell
the
guard
Agent
Neveu
is
probably
in
there
with
him."
"Agent
Neveu
left,
I
thought."
"Did
you
actually
see
her
leave?"
"No,
sir,
but"
"Well,
nobody
on
the
perimeter
saw
her
leave
either.
They
only
saw
her
go
in."
Collet
was
flabbergasted
by
Sophie
Neveu's
bravado.
She's
still
inside
the
building?
"Handle
it,"
Fache
ordered.
"I
want
Langdon
and
Neveu
at
gunpoint
by
the
time
I
get
back."
As
the
Trailor
truck
drove
off,
Captain
Fache
rounded
up
his
men.
Robert
Langdon
had
proven
an
elusive
quarry
tonight,
and
with
Agent
Neveu
now
helping
him,
he
might
be
far
harder
to
corner
than
expected.
Fache
decided
not
to
take
any
chances.
Hedging
his
bets,
he
ordered
half
of
his
men
back
to
the
Louvre
perimeter.
The
other
half
he
sent
to
guard
the
only
location
in
Paris
where
Robert
Langdon
could
find
safe
harbor.
Inside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Langdon
stared
in
astonishment
at
the
six
words
glowing
on
the
Plexiglas.
The
text
seemed
to
hover
in
space,
casting
a
jagged
shadow
across
Mona
Lisa's
mysterious
smile.
"The
Priory,"
Langdon
whispered.
"This
proves
your
grandfather
was
a
member!"
Sophie
looked
at
him
in
confusion.
"You
understand
this?"
"It's
flawless,"
Langdon
said,
nodding
as
his
thoughts
churned.
"It's
a
proclamation
of
one
of
the
Priory's
most
fundamental
philosophies!"
Sophie
looked
baffled
in
the
glow
of
the
message
scrawled
across
the
Mona
Lisa's
face.
SO
DARK
THE
CON
OF
MAN
"Sophie,"
Langdon
said,
"the
Priory's
tradition
of
perpetuating
goddess
worship
is
based
on
a
belief
that
powerful
men
in
the
early
Christian
church
'conned'
the
world
by
propagating
lies
that
devalued
the
female
and
tipped
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
masculine."
Sophie
remained
silent,
staring
at
the
words.
"The
Priory
believes
that
Constantine
and
his
male
successors
successfully
converted
the
world
from
matriarchal
paganism
to
patriarchal
Christianity
by
waging
a
campaign
of
propaganda
that
demonized
the
sacred
feminine,
obliterating
the
goddess
from
modern
religion
forever."
Sophie's
expression
remained
uncertain.
"My
grandfather
sent
me
to
this
spot
to
find
this.
He
must
be
trying
to
tell
me
more
than
that.
Langdon
understood
her
meaning.
She
thinks
this
is
another
code.
Whether
a
hidden
meaning
existed
here
or
not,
Langdon
could
not
immediately
say.
His
mind
was
still
grappling
with
the
bold
clarity
of
Sauniere's
outward
message.
So
dark
the
con
of
man,
he
thought.
So
dark
indeed.
Nobody
could
deny
the
enormous
good
the
modern
Church
did
in
today's
troubled
world,
and
yet
the
Church
had
a
deceitful
and
violent
history.
Their
brutal
crusade
to
"reeducate"
the
pagan
and
feminine
worshipping
religions
spanned
three
centuries,
employing
methods
as
inspired
as
they
were
horrific.
