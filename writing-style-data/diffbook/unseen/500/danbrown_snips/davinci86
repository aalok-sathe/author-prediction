space
behind
this
wall
is
hollow!
Feeling
around
the
edge
of
the
panels,
Sophie
found
a
recessed
fingerhold.
It
was
discreetly
crafted.
A
sliding
door.
Heart
pounding,
she
placed
her
finger
in
the
slot
and
pulled
it.
With
noiseless
precision,
the
heavy
wall
slid
sideways.
From
out
of
the
darkness
beyond,
the
voices
echoed
up.
Sophie
slipped
through
the
door
and
found
herself
on
a
rough
hewn
stone
staircase
that
spiraled
downward.
She'd
been
coming
to
this
house
since
she
was
a
child
and
yet
had
no
idea
this
staircase
even
existed!
As
she
descended,
the
air
grew
cooler.
The
voices
clearer.
She
heard
men
and
women
now.
Her
line
of
sight
was
limited
by
the
spiral
of
the
staircase,
but
the
last
step
was
now
rounding
into
view.
Beyond
it,
she
could
see
a
small
patch
of
the
basement
floor
stone,
illuminated
by
the
flickering
orange
blaze
of
firelight.
Holding
her
breath,
Sophie
inched
down
another
few
steps
and
crouched
down
to
look.
It
took
her
several
seconds
to
process
what
she
was
seeing.
The
room
was
a
grotto
a
coarse
chamber
that
appeared
to
have
been
hollowed
from
the
granite
of
the
hillside.
The
only
light
came
from
torches
on
the
walls.
In
the
glow
of
the
flames,
thirty
or
so
people
stood
in
a
circle
in
the
center
of
the
room.
I'm
dreaming,
Sophie
told
herself.
A
dream.
What
else
could
this
be?
Everyone
in
the
room
was
wearing
a
mask.
The
women
were
dressed
in
white
gossamer
gowns
and
golden
shoes.
Their
masks
were
white,
and
in
their
hands
they
carried
golden
orbs.
The
men
wore
long
black
tunics,
and
their
masks
were
black.
They
looked
like
pieces
in
a
giant
chess
set.
Everyone
in
the
circle
rocked
back
and
forth
and
chanted
in
reverence
to
something
on
the
floor
before
them
something
Sophie
could
not
see.
The
chanting
grew
steady
again.
Accelerating.
Thundering
now.
Faster.
The
participants
took
a
step
inward
and
knelt.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
could
finally
see
what
they
all
were
witnessing.
Even
as
she
staggered
back
in
horror,
she
felt
the
image
searing
itself
into
her
memory
forever.
Overtaken
by
nausea,
Sophie
spun,
clutching
at
the
stone
walls
as
she
clambered
back
up
the
stairs.
Pulling
the
door
closed,
she
fled
the
deserted
house,
and
drove
in
a
tearful
stupor
back
to
Paris.
That
night,
with
her
life
shattered
by
disillusionment
and
betrayal,
she
packed
her
belongings
and
left
her
home.
On
the
dining
room
table,
she
left
a
note.
I
WAS
THERE.
DON'T
TRY
TO
FIND
ME.
Beside
the
note,
she
laid
the
old
spare
key
from
the
chateau's
woodshed.
"Sophie!
Langdon's
voice
intruded.
"Stop!
Stop!"
Emerging
from
the
memory,
Sophie
slammed
on
the
brakes,
skidding
to
a
halt.
"What?
What
happened?
!
Langdon
pointed
down
the
long
street
before
them.
When
she
saw
it,
Sophie's
blood
went
cold.
A
hundred
yards
ahead,
the
intersection
was
blocked
by
a
couple
of
DCPJ
police
cars,
parked
askew,
their
purpose
obvious.
They've
