survived
public
knowledge
of
a
bloodline.
A
child
of
Jesus
would
undermine
the
critical
notion
of
Christ's
divinity
and
therefore
the
Christian
Church,
which
declared
itself
the
sole
vessel
through
which
humanity
could
access
the
divine
and
gain
entrance
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven."
"The
five
petal
rose,"
Sophie
said,
pointing
suddenly
to
the
spine
of
one
of
Teabing's
books.
The
same
exact
design
inlaid
on
the
rosewood
box.
Teabing
glanced
at
Langdon
and
grinned.
"She
has
a
good
eye."
He
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"That
is
the
Priory
symbol
for
the
Grail.
Mary
Magdalene.
Because
her
name
was
forbidden
by
the
Church,
Mary
Magdalene
became
secretly
known
by
many
pseudonyms
the
Chalice,
the
Holy
Grail,
and
the
Rose."
He
paused.
"The
Rose
has
ties
to
the
five
pointed
pentacle
of
Venus
and
the
guiding
Compass
Rose.
By
the
way,
the
word
rose
is
identical
in
English,
French,
German,
and
many
other
languages."
"Rose,"
Langdon
added,
"is
also
an
anagram
of
Eros,
the
Greek
god
of
sexual
love."
Sophie
gave
him
a
surprised
look
as
Teabing
plowed
on.
"The
Rose
has
always
been
the
premiere
symbol
of
female
sexuality.
In
primitive
goddess
cults,
the
five
petals
represented
the
five
stations
of
female
life
birth,
menstruation,
motherhood,
menopause,
and
death.
And
in
modern
times,
the
flowering
rose's
ties
to
womanhood
are
considered
more
visual."
He
glanced
at
Robert.
"Perhaps
the
symbologist
could
explain?"
Robert
hesitated.
A
moment
too
long.
"Oh,
heavens!"
Teabing
huffed.
"You
Americans
are
such
prudes."
He
looked
back
at
Sophie.
"What
Robert
is
fumbling
with
is
the
fact
that
the
blossoming
flower
resembles
the
female
genitalia,
the
sublime
blossom
from
which
all
mankind
enters
the
world.
And
if
you've
ever
seen
any
paintings
by
Georgia
O'Keeffe,
you'll
know
exactly
what
I
mean.
"The
point
here,"
Langdon
said,
motioning
back
to
the
bookshelf,
"is
that
all
of
these
books
substantiate
the
same
historical
claim."
"That
Jesus
was
a
father."
Sophie
was
still
uncertain.
"Yes,"
Teabing
said.
"And
that
Mary
Magdalene
was
the
womb
that
carried
His
royal
lineage.
The
Priory
of
Sion,
to
this
day,
still
worships
Mary
Magdalene
as
the
Goddess,
the
Holy
Grail,
the
Rose,
and
the
Divine
Mother."
Sophie
again
flashed
on
the
ritual
in
the
basement.
"According
to
the
Priory,"
Teabing
continued,
"Mary
Magdalene
was
pregnant
at
the
time
of
the
crucifixion.
For
the
safety
of
Christ's
unborn
child,
she
had
no
choice
but
to
flee
the
Holy
Land.
With
the
help
of
Jesus'
trusted
uncle,
Joseph
of
Arimathea,
Mary
Magdalene
secretly
traveled
to
France,
then
known
as
Gaul.
There
she
found
safe
refuge
in
the
Jewish
community.
It
was
here
in
France
that
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter.
Her
name
was
Sarah."
Sophie
glanced
up.
"They
actually
know
the
child's
name?"
"Far
more
than
that.
Magdalene's
and
Sarah's
lives
were
scrutinously
chronicled
by
their
Jewish
protectors.
Remember
that
Magdalene's
child
belonged
to
the
lineage
of
Jewish
kings
David
and
Solomon.
For
this
reason,
the
Jews
in
France
considered
Magdalene
sacred
royalty
and
revered
