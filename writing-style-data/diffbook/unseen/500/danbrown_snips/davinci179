foreign
sales.
Sauniere
was
a
no
brainer.
The
silence
on
the
other
end
lasted
a
long
time.
"When
did
you
send
it?"
"About
a
month
ago.
I
also
mentioned
you
would
be
in
Paris
soon
and
suggested
you
two
chat.
Did
he
ever
call
you
to
meet?"
Faukman
paused,
rubbing
his
eyes.
"Hold
on,
aren't
you
supposed
to
be
in
Paris
this
week?"
"lam
in
Paris."
Faukman
sat
upright.
"You
called
me
collect
from
Paris?"
"Take
it
out
of
my
royalties,
Jonas.
Did
you
ever
hear
back
from
Sauniere?
Did
he
like
the
manuscript?"
"I
don't
know.
I
haven't
yet
heard
from
him."
"Well,
don't
hold
your
breath.
I've
got
to
run,
but
this
explains
a
lot
Thanks."
"Robert"
But
Langdon
was
gone.
Faukman
hung
up
the
phone,
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
Authors,
he
thought.
Even
the
sane
ones
are
nuts.
Inside
the
Range
Rover,
Leigh
Teabing
let
out
a
guffaw.
"Robert,
you're
saying
you
wrote
a
manuscript
that
delves
into
a
secret
society,
and
your
editor
sent
a
copy
to
that
secret
society?"
Langdon
slumped.
"Evidently."
"A
cruel
coincidence,
my
friend."
Coincidence
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
Langdon
knew.
Asking
Jacques
Sauniere
to
endorse
a
manuscript
on
goddess
worship
was
as
obvious
as
asking
Tiger
Woods
to
endorse
a
book
on
golf.
Moreover,
it
was
virtually
guaranteed
that
any
book
on
goddess
worship
would
have
to
mention
the
Priory
of
Sion.
"Here's
the
million
dollar
question,"
Teabing
said,
still
chuckling.
"Was
your
position
on
the
Priory
favorable
or
unfavorable?"
Langdon
could
hear
Teabing's
true
meaning
loud
and
clear.
Many
historians
questioned
why
the
Priory
was
still
keeping
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden.
Some
felt
the
information
should
have
been
shared
with
the
world
long
ago.
"I
took
no
position
on
the
Priory's
actions."
"You
mean
lack
thereof."
Langdon
shrugged.
Teabing
was
apparently
on
the
side
of
making
the
documents
public.
"I
simply
provided
history
on
the
brotherhood
and
described
them
as
a
modern
goddess
worship
society,
keepers
of
the
Grail,
and
guardians
of
ancient
documents."
Sophie
looked
at
him.
"Did
you
mention
the
keystone?"
Langdon
winced.
He
had.
Numerous
times.
"I
talked
about
the
supposed
keystone
as
an
example
of
the
lengths
to
which
the
Priory
would
go
to
protect
the
Sangreal
documents."
Sophie
looked
amazed.
"I
guess
that
explains
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Langdon
sensed
it
was
actually
something
else
in
the
manuscript
that
had
piqued
Sauniere's
interest,
but
that
topic
was
something
he
would
discuss
with
Sophie
when
they
were
alone.
"So,"
Sophie
said,
"you
lied
to
Captain
Fache."
"What?"
Langdon
demanded.
"You
told
him
you
had
never
corresponded
with
my
grandfather."
"I
didn't!
My
editor
sent
him
a
manuscript."
"Think
about
it,
Robert.
If
Captain
Fache
didn't
find
the
envelope
in
which
your
editor
sent
the
manuscript,
he
would
have
to
conclude
that
you
sent
it."
She
paused.
"Or
worse,
that
you
hand
delivered
it
and
lied
about
it.
