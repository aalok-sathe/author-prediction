been
the
widely
publicized
trial
of
FBI
spy
Robert
Hanssen,
who,
in
addition
to
being
a
prominent
member
of
Opus
Dei,
had
turned
out
to
be
a
sexual
deviant,
his
trial
uncovering
evidence
that
he
had
rigged
hidden
video
cameras
in
his
own
bedroom
so
his
friends
could
watch
him
having
sex
with
his
wife.
"Hardly
the
pastime
of
a
devout
Catholic,"
the
judge
had
noted.
Sadly,
all
of
these
events
had
helped
spawn
the
new
watch
group
known
as
the
Opus
Dei
Awareness
Network
(ODAN).
The
group's
popular
website
www.odan.org
relayed
frightening
stories
from
former
Opus
Dei
members
who
warned
of
the
dangers
of
joining.
The
media
was
now
referring
to
Opus
Dei
as
"God's
Mafia"
and
"the
Cult
of
Christ."
We
fear
what
we
do
not
understand,
Aringarosa
thought,
wondering
if
these
critics
had
any
idea
how
many
lives
Opus
Dei
had
enriched.
The
group
enjoyed
the
full
endorsement
and
blessing
of
the
Vatican.
Opus
Dei
is
a
personal
prelature
of
the
Pope
himself.
Recently,
however,
Opus
Dei
had
found
itself
threatened
by
a
force
infinitely
more
powerful
than
the
media
an
unexpected
foe
from
which
Aringarosa
could
not
possibly
hide.
Five
months
ago,
the
kaleidoscope
of
power
had
been
shaken,
and
Aringarosa
was
still
reeling
from
the
blow.
"They
know
not
the
war
they
have
begun,"
Aringarosa
whispered
to
himself,
staring
out
the
plane's
window
at
the
darkness
of
the
ocean
below.
For
an
instant,
his
eyes
refocused,
lingering
on
the
reflection
of
his
awkward
face
dark
and
oblong,
dominated
by
a
flat,
crooked
nose
that
had
been
shattered
by
a
fist
in
Spain
when
he
was
a
young
missionary.
The
physical
flaw
barely
registered
now.
Aringarosa's
was
a
world
of
the
soul,
not
of
the
flesh.
As
the
jet
passed
over
the
coast
of
Portugal,
the
cell
phone
in
Aringarosa's
cassock
began
vibrating
in
silent
ring
mode.
Despite
airline
regulations
prohibiting
the
use
of
cell
phones
during
flights,
Aringarosa
knew
this
was
a
call
he
could
not
miss.
Only
one
man
possessed
this
number,
the
man
who
had
mailed
Aringarosa
the
phone.
Excited,
the
bishop
answered
quietly.
"Yes?"
"Silas
has
located
the
keystone,"
the
caller
said.
"It
is
in
Paris.
Within
the
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice."
Bishop
Aringarosa
smiled.
"Then
we
are
close."
"We
can
obtain
it
immediately.
But
we
need
your
influence."
"Of
course.
Tell
me
what
to
do."
When
Aringarosa
switched
off
the
phone,
his
heart
was
pounding.
He
gazed
once
again
into
the
void
of
night,
feeling
dwarfed
by
the
events
he
had
put
into
motion.
Five
hundred
miles
away,
the
albino
named
Silas
stood
over
a
small
basin
of
water
and
dabbed
the
blood
from
his
back,
watching
the
patterns
of
red
spinning
in
the
water.
Purge
me
with
hyssop
and
I
shall
be
clean,
he
prayed,
quoting
Psalms.
Wash
me,
and
I
shall
be
whiter
than
snow.
Silas
was
feeling
an
aroused
anticipation
that
he
had
not
felt
since
his
previous
life.
It
both
surprised
and
electrified
him.
For
the
last
