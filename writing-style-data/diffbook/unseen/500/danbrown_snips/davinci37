Apparently
not.
I'll
inform
the
director
of
Cryptography
you
no
longer
need
our
services."
With
that,
she
turned
on
her
heel,
and
marched
off
the
way
she
had
come.
Stunned,
Fache
watched
her
disappear
into
the
darkness.
Is
she
out
of
her
mind?
Sophie
Neveu
had
just
redefined
le
suicide
professionnel.
Fache
turned
to
Langdon,
who
was
still
on
the
phone,
looking
more
concerned
than
before,
listening
intently
to
his
phone
message.
The
U.S.
Embassy.
Bezu
Fache
despised
many
things
but
few
drew
more
wrath
than
the
U.S.
Embassy.
Fache
and
the
ambassador
locked
horns
regularly
over
shared
affairs
of
state
their
most
common
battleground
being
law
enforcement
for
visiting
Americans.
Almost
daily,
DCPJ
arrested
American
exchange
students
in
possession
of
drugs,
U.S.
businessmen
for
soliciting
underage
Prostitutes,
American
tourists
for
shoplifting
or
destruction
of
property.
Legally,
the
U.S.
Embassy
could
intervene
and
extradite
guilty
citizens
back
to
the
United
States,
where
they
received
nothing
more
than
a
slap
on
the
wrist.
And
the
embassy
invariably
did
just
that.
L
'emasculation
de
la
Police
Judiciaire,
Fache
called
it.
Paris
Match
had
run
a
cartoon
recently
depicting
Fache
as
a
police
dog,
trying
to
bite
an
American
criminal,
but
unable
to
reach
because
it
was
chained
to
the
U.S.
Embassy.
Not
tonight,
Fache
told
himself.
There
is
far
too
much
at
stake.
By
the
time
Robert
Langdon
hung
up
the
phone,
he
looked
ill.
"Is
everything
all
right?"
Fache
asked.
Weakly,
Langdon
shook
his
head.
Bad
news
from
home,
Fache
sensed,
noticing
Langdon
was
sweating
slightly
as
Fache
took
back
his
cell
phone.
"An
accident,"
Langdon
stammered,
looking
at
Fache
with
a
strange
expression.
"A
friend"
He
hesitated.
"I'll
need
to
fly
home
first
thing
in
the
morning."
Fache
had
no
doubt
the
shock
on
Langdon's
face
was
genuine,
and
yet
he
sensed
another
emotion
there
too,
as
if
a
distant
fear
were
suddenly
simmering
in
the
American's
eyes.
"I'm
sorry
to
hear
that,"
Fache
said,
watching
Langdon
closely.
"Would
you
like
to
sit
down?"
He
motioned
toward
one
of
the
viewing
benches
in
the
gallery.
Langdon
nodded
absently
and
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
bench.
He
paused,
looking
more
confused
with
every
moment.
"Actually,
I
think
I'd
like
to
use
the
rest
room."
Fache
frowned
inwardly
at
the
delay.
"The
rest
room.
Of
course.
Let's
take
a
break
for
a
few
minutes."
He
motioned
back
down
the
long
hallway
in
the
direction
they
had
come
from.
"The
rest
rooms
are
back
toward
the
curator's
office."
Langdon
hesitated,
pointing
in
the
other
direction
toward
the
far
end
of
the
Grand
Gallery
corridor.
"I
believe
there's
a
much
closer
rest
room
at
the
end."
Fache
realized
Langdon
was
right.
They
were
two
thirds
of
the
way
down,
and
the
Grand
Gallery
dead
ended
at
a
pair
of
rest
rooms.
"Shall
I
accompany
you?"
Langdon
shook
his
head,
already
moving
deeper
into
the
gallery.
"Not
necessary.
I
think
I'd
like
a
few
minutes
alone."
Fache
was
not
wild
about
the
idea
of
