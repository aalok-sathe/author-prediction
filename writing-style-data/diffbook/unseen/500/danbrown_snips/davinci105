to
tell
Langdon
what
she
had
witnessed
that
night
in
the
Normandy
chateau.
For
ten
years
now,
simple
shame
had
kept
her
from
telling
a
soul.
Just
thinking
about
it,
she
shuddered.
Sirens
howled
somewhere
in
the
distance,
and
she
felt
a
thickening
shroud
of
fatigue
settling
over
her.
"There!"
Langdon
said,
feeling
excited
to
see
the
huge
complex
of
the
Roland
Garros
tennis
stadium
looming
ahead.
Sophie
snaked
her
way
toward
the
stadium.
After
several
passes,
they
located
the
intersection
of
Rue
Haxo
and
turned
onto
it,
driving
in
the
direction
of
the
lower
numbers.
The
road
became
more
industrial,
lined
with
businesses.
We
need
number
twenty
four,
Langdon
told
himself,
realizing
he
was
secretly
scanning
the
horizon
for
the
spires
of
a
church.
Don't
be
ridiculous.
A
forgotten
Templar
church
in
this
neighborhood?
"There
it
is,"
Sophie
exclaimed,
pointing.
Langdon's
eyes
followed
to
the
structure
ahead.
What
in
the
world?
The
building
was
modern.
A
squat
citadel
with
a
giant,
neon
equal
armed
cross
emblazoned
atop
its
facade.
Beneath
the
cross
were
the
words:
DEPOSITORY
BANK
OF
ZURICH
Langdon
was
thankful
not
to
have
shared
his
Templar
church
hopes
with
Sophie.
A
career
hazard
of
symbologists
was
a
tendency
to
extract
hidden
meaning
from
situations
that
had
none.
In
this
case,
Langdon
had
entirely
forgotten
that
the
peaceful,
equal
armed
cross
had
been
adopted
as
the
perfect
symbol
for
the
flag
of
neutral
Switzerland.
At
least
the
mystery
was
solved.
Sophie
and
Langdon
were
holding
the
key
to
a
Swiss
bank
deposit
box.
Outside
Castel
Gandolfo,
an
updraft
of
mountain
air
gushed
over
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
across
the
high
bluff,
sending
a
chill
through
Bishop
Aringarosa
as
he
stepped
from
the
Fiat.
should
have
worn
more
than
this
cassock,
he
thought,
fighting
the
reflex
to
shiver.
The
last
thing
he
needed
to
appear
tonight
was
weak
or
fearful.
The
castle
was
dark
save
the
windows
at
the
very
top
of
the
building,
which
glowed
ominously.
The
library,
Aringarosa
thought.
They
are
awake
and
waiting.
He
ducked
his
head
against
the
wind
and
continued
on
without
so
much
as
a
glance
toward
the
observatory
domes.
The
priest
who
greeted
him
at
the
door
looked
sleepy.
He
was
the
same
priest
who
had
greeted
Aringarosa
five
months
ago,
albeit
tonight
he
did
so
with
much
less
hospitality.
"We
were
worried
about
you,
Bishop,"
the
priest
said,
checking
his
watch
and
looking
more
perturbed
than
worried.
"My
apologies.
Airlines
are
so
unreliable
these
days."
The
priest
mumbled
something
inaudible
and
then
said,
"They
are
waiting
upstairs.
I
will
escort
you
up."
The
library
was
a
vast
square
room
with
dark
wood
from
floor
to
ceiling.
On
all
sides,
towering
bookcases
burgeoned
with
volumes.
The
floor
was
amber
marble
with
black
basalt
trim,
a
handsome
reminder
that
this
building
had
once
been
a
palace.
"Welcome,
Bishop,"
a
man's
voice
said
from
across
the
room.
Aringarosa
tried
to
see
who
had
spoken,
but
the
lights
were
ridiculously
low
much
lower
