doll,
his
black
cassock
flapping.
Lifting
a
weary
arm,
he
mopped
his
eyes
and
saw
the
man
holding
him
was
Silas.
The
great
albino
was
struggling
down
a
misty
sidewalk,
shouting
for
a
hospital,
his
voice
a
heartrending
wail
of
agony.
His
red
eyes
were
focused
dead
ahead,
tears
streaming
down
his
pale,
bloodspattered
face.
"My
son,"
Aringarosa
whispered,
"you're
hurt."
Silas
glanced
down,
his
visage
contorted
in
anguish.
"I
am
so
very
sorry,
Father."
He
seemed
almost
too
pained
to
speak.
"No,
Silas,"
Aringarosa
replied.
"It
is
I
who
am
sorry.
This
is
my
fault."
The
Teacher
promised
me
there
would
be
no
killing,
and
I
told
you
to
obey
him
fully.
"I
was
too
eager.
Too
fearful.
You
and
I
were
deceived."
The
Teacher
was
never
going
to
deliver
us
the
Holy
Grail.
Cradled
in
the
arms
of
the
man
he
had
taken
in
all
those
years
ago,
Bishop
Aringarosa
felt
himself
reel
back
in
time.
To
Spain.
To
his
modest
beginnings,
building
a
small
Catholic
church
in
Oviedo
with
Silas.
And
later,
to
New
York
City,
where
he
had
proclaimed
the
glory
of
God
with
the
towering
Opus
Dei
Center
on
Lexington
Avenue.
Five
months
ago,
Aringarosa
had
received
devastating
news.
His
life's
work
was
in
jeopardy.
He
recalled,
with
vivid
detail,
the
meeting
inside
Castel
Gandolfo
that
had
changed
his
life
the
news
that
had
set
this
entire
calamity
into
motion.
Aringarosa
had
entered
Gandolfo's
Astronomy
Library
with
his
head
held
high,
fully
expecting
to
be
lauded
by
throngs
of
welcoming
hands,
all
eager
to
pat
him
on
the
back
for
his
superior
work
representing
Catholicism
in
America.
But
only
three
people
were
present.
The
Vatican
secretariat.
Obese.
Dour.
Two
high
ranking
Italian
cardinals.
Sanctimonious.
Smug.
"Secretariat?"
Aringarosa
said,
puzzled.
The
rotund
overseer
of
legal
affairs
shook
Aringarosa's
hand
and
motioned
to
the
chair
opposite
him.
"Please,
make
yourself
comfortable."
Aringarosa
sat,
sensing
something
was
wrong.
"I
am
not
skilled
in
small
talk,
Bishop,"
the
secretariat
said,
"so
let
me
be
direct
about
the
reason
for
your
visit."
"Please.
Speak
openly."
Aringarosa
glanced
at
the
two
cardinals,
who
seemed
to
be
measuring
him
with
self
righteous
anticipation.
"As
you
are
well
aware,"
the
secretariat
said,
"His
Holiness
and
others
in
Rome
have
been
concerned
lately
with
the
political
fallout
from
Opus
Dei's
more
controversial
practices."
Aringarosa
felt
himself
bristle
instantly.
He
already
had
been
through
this
on
numerous
occasions
with
the
new
pontiff,
who,
to
Aringarosa's
great
dismay,
had
turned
out
to
be
a
distressingly
fervent
voice
for
liberal
change
in
the
Church.
"I
want
to
assure
you,"
the
secretariat
added
quickly,
"that
His
Holiness
does
not
seek
to
change
anything
about
the
way
you
run
your
ministry.
should
hope
not!
"Then
why
am
I
here?"
The
enormous
man
sighed.
"Bishop,
I
am
not
sure
how
to
say
this
delicately,
so
I
will
state
it
directly.
Two
days
ago,
the
Secretariat
Council
voted
unanimously
to
revoke
the
Vatican's
sanction
of
Opus
Dei."
Aringarosa
was
certain
he
