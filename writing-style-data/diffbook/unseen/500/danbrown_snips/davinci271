but
as
they
embraced,
she
could
feel
the
power
of
the
blood
coursing
through
his
veins
the
blood
she
now
understood
they
shared.
When
Langdon
walked
across
the
lawn
to
join
them,
Sophie
could
not
imagine
that
only
yesterday
she
had
felt
so
alone
in
the
world.
And
now,
somehow,
in
this
foreign
place,
in
the
company
of
three
people
she
barely
knew,
she
felt
at
last
that
she
was
home.
Night
had
fallen
over
Rosslyn.
Robert
Langdon
stood
alone
on
the
porch
of
the
fieldstone
house
enjoying
the
sounds
of
laughter
and
reunion
drifting
through
the
screened
door
behind
him.
The
mug
of
potent
Brazilian
coffee
in
his
hand
had
granted
him
a
hazy
reprieve
from
his
mounting
exhaustion,
and
yet
he
sensed
the
reprieve
would
be
fleeting.
The
fatigue
in
his
body
went
to
the
core.
"You
slipped
out
quietly,"
a
voice
behind
him
said.
He
turned.
Sophie's
grandmother
emerged,
her
silver
hair
shimmering
in
the
night.
Her
name,
for
the
last
twenty
eight
years
at
least,
was
Marie
Chauvel.
Langdon
gave
a
tired
smile.
"I
thought
I'd
give
your
family
some
time
together."
Through
the
window,
he
could
see
Sophie
talking
with
her
brother.
Marie
came
over
and
stood
beside
him.
"Mr.
Langdon,
when
I
first
heard
of
Jacques's
murder,
I
was
terrified
for
Sophie's
safety.
Seeing
her
standing
in
my
doorway
tonight
was
the
greatest
relief
of
my
life.
I
cannot
thank
you
enough."
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
Although
he
had
offered
to
give
Sophie
and
her
grandmother
time
to
talk
in
private,
Marie
had
asked
him
to
stay
and
listen.
My
husband
obviously
trusted
you,
Mr.
Langdon,
so
I
do
as
well.
And
so
Langdon
had
remained,
standing
beside
Sophie
and
listening
in
mute
astonishment
while
Marie
told
the
story
of
Sophie's
late
parents.
Incredibly,
both
had
been
from
Merovingian
families
direct
descendants
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus
Christ.
Sophie's
parents
and
ancestors,
for
protection,
had
changed
their
family
names
of
Plantard
and
Saint
Clair.
Their
children
represented
the
most
direct
surviving
royal
bloodline
and
therefore
were
carefully
guarded
by
the
Priory.
When
Sophie's
parents
were
killed
in
a
car
accident
whose
cause
could
not
be
determined,
the
Priory
feared
the
identity
of
the
royal
line
had
been
discovered.
"Your
grandfather
and
I,"
Marie
had
explained
in
a
voice
choked
with
pain,
"had
to
make
a
grave
decision
the
instant
we
received
the
phone
call.
Your
parents'
car
had
just
been
found
in
the
river."
She
dabbed
at
the
tears
in
her
eyes.
"All
six
of
us
including
you
two
grandchildren
were
supposed
to
be
traveling
together
in
that
car
that
very
night.
Fortunately
we
changed
our
plans
at
the
last
moment,
and
your
parents
were
alone.
Hearing
of
the
accident,
Jacques
and
I
had
no
way
to
know
what
had
really
happened
or
if
this
was
truly
an
accident.
"
Marie
looked
at
Sophie.
"We
knew
we
had
to
protect
our
grandchildren,
and
we
did
what
we
thought
was
best.
Jacques
