thirty
eight.
Verse
eleven.
Although
Silas
did
not
recall
the
exact
contents
of
verse
eleven
by
heart,
he
knew
the
Book
of
Job
told
the
story
of
a
man
whose
faith
in
God
survived
repeated
tests.
Appropriate,
he
thought,
barely
able
to
contain
his
excitement.
Looking
over
his
shoulder,
he
gazed
down
the
shimmering
Rose
Line
and
couldn't
help
but
smile.
There
atop
the
main
altar,
propped
open
on
a
gilded
book
stand,
sat
an
enormous
leather
bound
Bible.
Up
in
the
balcony,
Sister
Sandrine
was
shaking.
Moments
ago,
she
had
been
about
to
flee
and
carry
out
her
orders,
when
the
man
below
suddenly
removed
his
cloak.
When
she
saw
his
alabaster
white
flesh,
she
was
overcome
with
a
horrified
bewilderment.
His
broad,
pale
back
was
soaked
with
blood
red
slashes.
Even
from
here
she
could
see
the
wounds
were
fresh.
This
man
has
been
mercilessly
whipped!
She
also
saw
the
bloody
cilice
around
his
thigh,
the
wound
beneath
it
dripping.
What
kind
of
God
would
want
a
body
punished
this
way?
The
rituals
of
Opus
Dei,
Sister
Sandrine
knew,
were
not
something
she
would
ever
understand.
But
that
was
hardly
her
concern
at
this
instant.
Opus
Dei
is
searching
for
the
keystone.
How
they
knew
of
it,
Sister
Sandrine
could
not
imagine,
although
she
knew
she
did
not
have
time
to
think.
The
bloody
monk
was
now
quietly
donning
his
cloak
again,
clutching
his
prize
as
he
moved
toward
the
altar,
toward
the
Bible.
In
breathless
silence,
Sister
Sandrine
left
the
balcony
and
raced
down
the
hall
to
her
quarters.
Getting
on
her
hands
and
knees,
she
reached
beneath
her
wooden
bed
frame
and
retrieved
the
sealed
envelope
she
had
hidden
there
years
ago.
Tearing
it
open,
she
found
four
Paris
phone
numbers.
Trembling,
she
began
to
dial.
Downstairs,
Silas
laid
the
stone
tablet
on
the
altar
and
turned
his
eager
hands
to
the
leather
Bible.
His
long
white
fingers
were
sweating
now
as
he
turned
the
pages.
Flipping
through
the
Old
Testament,
he
found
the
Book
of
Job.
He
located
chapter
thirty
eight.
As
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
column
of
text,
he
anticipated
the
words
he
was
about
to
read.
They
will
lead
the
way!
Finding
verse
number
eleven,
Silas
read
the
text.
It
was
only
seven
words.
Confused,
he
read
it
again,
sensing
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong.
The
verse
simply
read:
HITHERTO
SHALT
THOU
COME,
BUT
NO
FURTHER.
Security
warden
Claude
Grouard
simmered
with
rage
as
he
stood
over
his
prostrate
captive
in
front
of
the
Mona
Lisa.
This
bastard
killed
Jacques
Sauniere!
Sauniere
had
been
like
a
well
loved
father
to
Grouard
and
his
security
team.
Grouard
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
pull
the
trigger
and
bury
a
bullet
in
Robert
Langdon's
back.
As
senior
warden,
Grouard
was
one
of
the
few
guards
who
actually
carried
a
loaded
weapon.
He
reminded
himself,
however,
that
killing
Langdon
would
be
a
generous
fate
compared
to
the
misery
about
to
be
communicated
by
Bezu
Fache
