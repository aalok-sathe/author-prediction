diameter
and
embossed
with
the
letters
N
and
S.
Nord.
Sud.
He
turned
due
south,
letting
his
eye
trace
the
extended
line
formed
by
the
medallions.
He
began
moving
again,
following
the
trail,
watching
the
pavement
as
he
walked.
As
he
cut
across
the
corner
of
the
Comedie
Francaise,
another
bronze
medallion
passed
beneath
his
feet.
Yes!
The
streets
of
Paris,
Langdon
had
learned
years
ago,
were
adorned
with
135
of
these
bronze
markers,
embedded
in
sidewalks,
courtyards,
and
streets,
on
a
north
south
axis
across
the
city.
He
had
once
followed
the
line
from
Sacre
Coeur,
north
across
the
Seine,
and
finally
to
the
ancient
Paris
Observatory.
There
he
discovered
the
significance
of
the
sacred
path
it
traced.
The
earth's
original
prime
meridian.
The
first
zero
longitude
of
the
world.
Paris
's
ancient
Rose
Line.
Now,
as
Langdon
hurried
across
Rue
de
Rivoli,
he
could
feel
his
destination
within
reach.
Less
than
a
block
away.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
The
revelations
were
coming
now
in
waves.
Sauniere's
ancient
spelling
of
Roslin
the
blade
and
chalice
the
tomb
adorned
with
masters'
art.
Is
that
why
Sauniere
needed
to
talk
with
me
?
Had
I
unknowingly
guessed
the
truth
?
He
broke
into
a
jog,
feeling
the
Rose
Line
beneath
his
feet,
guiding
him,
pulling
him
toward
his
destination.
As
he
entered
the
long
tunnel
of
Passage
Richelieu,
the
hairs
on
his
neck
began
to
bristle
with
anticipation.
He
knew
that
at
the
end
of
this
tunnel
stood
the
most
mysterious
of
Parisian
monuments
conceived
and
commissioned
in
the
1980s
by
the
Sphinx
himself,
Francois
Mitterrand,
a
man
rumored
to
move
in
secret
circles,
a
man
whose
final
legacy
to
Paris
was
a
place
Langdon
had
visited
only
days
before.
Another
lifetime.
With
a
final
surge
of
energy,
Langdon
burst
from
the
passageway
into
the
familiar
courtyard
and
came
to
a
stop.
Breathless,
he
raised
his
eyes,
slowly,
disbelieving,
to
the
glistening
structure
in
front
of
him.
The
Louvre
Pyramid.
Gleaming
in
the
darkness.
He
admired
it
only
a
moment.
He
was
more
interested
in
what
lay
to
his
right.
Turning,
he
felt
his
feet
again
tracing
the
invisible
path
of
the
ancient
Rose
Line,
carrying
him
across
the
courtyard
to
the
Carrousel
du
Louvre
the
enormous
circle
of
grass
surrounded
by
a
perimeter
of
neatly
trimmed
hedges
once
the
site
of
Paris's
primeval
nature
worshipping
festivals
joyous
rites
to
celebrate
fertility
and
the
Goddess.
Langdon
felt
as
if
he
were
crossing
into
another
world
as
he
stepped
over
the
bushes
to
the
grassy
area
within.
This
hallowed
ground
was
now
marked
by
one
of
the
city's
most
unusual
monuments.
There
in
the
center,
plunging
into
the
earth
like
a
crystal
chasm,
gaped
the
giant
inverted
pyramid
of
glass
that
he
had
seen
a
few
nights
ago
when
he
entered
the
Louvre's
subterranean
entresol.
La
Pyramide
Inversee.
Tremulous,
Langdon
walked
to
the
edge
and
peered
down
into
the
Louvre's
sprawling
underground
complex,
aglow
with
amber
light.
His
eye
