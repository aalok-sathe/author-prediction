her
as
the
progenitor
of
the
royal
line
of
kings.
Countless
scholars
of
that
era
chronicled
Mary
Magdalene's
days
in
France,
including
the
birth
of
Sarah
and
the
subsequent
family
tree."
Sophie
was
startled.
"There
exists
a
family
tree
of
Jesus
Christ?"
"Indeed.
And
it
is
purportedly
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
the
Sangreal
documents.
A
complete
genealogy
of
the
early
descendants
of
Christ."
"But
what
good
is
a
documented
genealogy
of
Christ's
bloodline?"
Sophie
asked.
"It's
not
proof.
Historians
could
not
possibly
confirm
its
authenticity."
Teabing
chuckled.
"No
more
so
than
they
can
confirm
the
authenticity
of
the
Bible.
"Meaning?"
"Meaning
that
history
is
always
written
by
the
winners.
When
two
cultures
clash,
the
loser
is
obliterated,
and
the
winner
writes
the
history
books
books
which
glorify
their
own
cause
and
disparage
the
conquered
foe.
As
Napoleon
once
said,
'What
is
history,
but
a
fable
agreed
upon?'
He
smiled.
"By
its
very
nature,
history
is
always
a
one
sided
account."
Sophie
had
never
thought
of
it
that
way.
"The
Sangreal
documents
simply
tell
the
other
side
of
the
Christ
story.
In
the
end,
which
side
of
the
story
you
believe
becomes
a
matter
of
faith
and
personal
exploration,
but
at
least
the
information
has
survived.
The
Sangreal
documents
include
tens
of
thousands
of
pages
of
information.
Eyewitness
accounts
of
the
Sangreal
treasure
describe
it
as
being
carried
in
four
enormous
trunks.
In
those
trunks
are
reputed
to
be
the
Purist
Documents
thousands
of
pages
of
unaltered,
pre
Constantine
documents,
written
by
the
early
followers
of
Jesus,
revering
Him
as
a
wholly
human
teacher
and
prophet.
Also
rumored
to
be
part
of
the
treasure
is
the
legendary
"Q"
Document
a
manuscript
that
even
the
Vatican
admits
they
believe
exists.
Allegedly,
it
is
a
book
of
Jesus'
teachings,
possibly
written
in
His
own
hand."
"Writings
by
Christ
Himself?"
"Of
course,"
Teabing
said.
"Why
wouldn't
Jesus
have
kept
a
chronicle
of
His
ministry?
Most
people
did
in
those
days.
Another
explosive
document
believed
to
be
in
the
treasure
is
a
manuscript
called
The
Magdalene
Diaries
Mary
Magdalene's
personal
account
of
her
relationship
with
Christ,
His
crucifixion,
and
her
time
in
France."
Sophie
was
silent
for
a
long
moment.
"And
these
four
chests
of
documents
were
the
treasure
that
the
Knights
Templar
found
under
Solomon's
Temple?"
"Exactly.
The
documents
that
made
the
Knights
so
powerful.
The
documents
that
have
been
the
object
of
countless
Grail
quests
throughout
history."
"But
you
said
the
Holy
Grail
was
Mary
Magdalene.
If
people
are
searching
for
documents,
why
would
you
call
it
a
search
for
the
Holy
Grail?"
Teabing
eyed
her,
his
expression
softening.
"Because
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail
includes
a
sarcophagus."
Outside,
the
wind
howled
in
the
trees.
Teabing
spoke
more
quietly
now.
"The
quest
for
the
Holy
Grail
is
literally
the
quest
to
kneel
before
the
bones
of
Mary
Magdalene.
A
journey
to
pray
at
the
feet
of
the
outcast
one,
the
lost
sacred
feminine."
Sophie
felt
an
unexpected
wonder.
"The
hiding
