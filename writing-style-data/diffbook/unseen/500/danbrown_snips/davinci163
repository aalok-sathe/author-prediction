me,
I
have
been
researching
them
for
decades,
and
I
can't
even
name
one
Priory
member.
It
seems
inconceivable
that
all
three
senechaux
and
the
Grand
Master
could
be
discovered
and
killed
in
one
day.
"I
doubt
the
information
was
gathered
in
a
single
day,"
Sophie
said.
"It
sounds
like
a
well
planned
decapiter.
It's
a
technique
we
use
to
fight
organized
crime
syndicates.
If
DCPJ
wants
to
move
on
a
certain
group,
they
will
silently
listen
and
watch
for
months,
identify
all
the
main
players,
and
then
move
in
and
take
them
all
at
the
same
moment.
Decapitation.
With
no
leadership,
the
group
falls
into
chaos
and
divulges
other
information.
It's
possible
someone
patiently
watched
the
Priory
and
then
attacked,
hoping
the
top
people
would
reveal
the
location
of
the
keystone."
Teabing
looked
unconvinced.
"But
the
brothers
would
never
talk.
They
are
sworn
to
secrecy.
Even
in
the
face
of
death."
"Exactly,"
Langdon
said.
"Meaning,
if
they
never
divulged
the
secret,
and
they
were
killed"
Teabing
gasped.
"Then
the
location
of
the
keystone
would
be
lost
forever!"
"And
with
it,"
Langdon
said,
"the
location
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Teabing's
body
seemed
to
sway
with
the
weight
of
Langdon's
words.
Then,
as
if
too
tired
to
stand
another
moment,
he
flopped
in
a
chair
and
stared
out
the
window.
Sophie
walked
over,
her
voice
soft.
"Considering
my
grandfather's
predicament,
it
seems
possible
that
in
total
desperation
he
tried
to
pass
the
secret
on
to
someone
outside
the
brotherhood.
Someone
he
thought
he
could
trust.
Someone
in
his
family."
Teabing
was
pale.
"But
someone
capable
of
such
an
attack
of
discovering
so
much
about
the
brotherhood"
He
paused,
radiating
a
new
fear.
"It
could
only
be
one
force.
This
kind
of
infiltration
could
only
have
come
from
the
Priory's
oldest
enemy."
Langdon
glanced
up.
"The
Church."
"Who
else?
Rome
has
been
seeking
the
Grail
for
centuries."
Sophie
was
skeptical.
"You
think
the
Church
killed
my
grandfather?"
Teabing
replied,
"It
would
not
be
the
first
time
in
history
the
Church
has
killed
to
protect
itself.
The
documents
that
accompany
the
Holy
Grail
are
explosive,
and
the
Church
has
wanted
to
destroy
them
for
years."
Langdon
was
having
trouble
buying
Teabing's
premise
that
the
Church
would
blatantly
murder
people
to
obtain
these
documents.
Having
met
the
new
Pope
and
many
of
the
cardinals,
Langdon
knew
they
were
deeply
spiritual
men
who
would
never
condone
assassination.
Regardless
of
the
stakes.
Sophie
seemed
to
be
having
similar
thoughts.
"Isn't
it
possible
that
these
Priory
members
were
murdered
by
someone
outside
the
Church?
Someone
who
didn't
understand
what
the
Grail
really
is?
The
Cup
of
Christ,
after
all,
would
be
quite
an
enticing
treasure.
Certainly
treasure
hunters
have
killed
for
less."
"In
my
experience,"
Teabing
said,
"men
go
to
far
greater
lengths
to
avoid
what
they
fear
than
to
obtain
what
they
desire.
I
sense
a
desperation
in
this
assault
on
the
Priory."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"the
argument
is
paradoxical.
Why
would
members
of
the
Catholic
