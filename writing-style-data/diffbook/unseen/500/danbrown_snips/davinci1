Robert
Langdon
awoke
slowly.
A
telephone
was
ringing
in
the
darkness
a
tinny,
unfamiliar
ring.
He
fumbled
for
the
bedside
lamp
and
turned
it
on.
Squinting
at
his
surroundings
he
saw
a
plush
Renaissance
bedroom
with
Louis
XVI
furniture,
hand
frescoed
walls,
and
a
colossal
mahogany
four
poster
bed.
Where
the
hell
am
I?
The
jacquard
bathrobe
hanging
on
his
bedpost
bore
the
monogram:
HOTEL
RITZ
PARIS.
Slowly,
the
fog
began
to
lift.
Langdon
picked
up
the
receiver.
"Hello?"
"Monsieur
Langdon?"
a
man's
voice
said.
"I
hope
I
have
not
awoken
you?"
Dazed,
Langdon
looked
at
the
bedside
clock.
It
was
12:32
A.M.
He
had
been
asleep
only
an
hour,
but
he
felt
like
the
dead.
"This
is
the
concierge,
monsieur.
I
apologize
for
this
intrusion,
but
you
have
a
visitor.
He
insists
it
is
urgent."
Langdon
still
felt
fuzzy.
A
visitor?
His
eyes
focused
now
on
a
crumpled
flyer
on
his
bedside
table.
THE
AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY
OF
PARIS
proudly
presents
AN
EVENING
WITH
ROBERT
LANGDON
PROFESSOR
OF
RELIGIOUS
SYMBOLOGY,
HARVARD
UNIVERSITY
Langdon
groaned.
Tonight's
lecture
a
slide
show
about
pagan
symbolism
hidden
in
the
stones
of
Chartres
Cathedral
had
probably
ruffled
some
conservative
feathers
in
the
audience.
Most
likely,
some
religious
scholar
had
trailed
him
home
to
pick
a
fight.
"I'm
sorry,"
Langdon
said,
"but
I'm
very
tired
and
"Mais,
monsieur,
"
the
concierge
pressed,
lowering
his
voice
to
an
urgent
whisper.
"Your
guest
is
an
important
man."
Langdon
had
little
doubt.
His
books
on
religious
paintings
and
cult
symbology
had
made
him
a
reluctant
celebrity
in
the
art
world,
and
last
year
Langdon's
visibility
had
increased
a
hundredfold
after
his
involvement
in
a
widely
publicized
incident
at
the
Vatican.
Since
then,
the
stream
of
self
important
historians
and
art
buffs
arriving
at
his
door
had
seemed
never
ending.
"If
you
would
be
so
kind,"
Langdon
said,
doing
his
best
to
remain
polite,
"could
you
take
the
man's
name
and
number,
and
tell
him
I'll
try
to
call
him
before
I
leave
Paris
on
Tuesday?
Thank
you."
He
hung
up
before
the
concierge
could
protest.
Sitting
up
now,
Langdon
frowned
at
his
bedside
Guest
Relations
Handbook,
whose
cover
boasted:
SLEEP
LIKE
A
BABY
IN
THE
CITY
OF
LIGHTS.
SLUMBER
AT
THE
PARIS
RITZ.
He
turned
and
gazed
tiredly
into
the
full
length
mirror
across
the
room.
The
man
staring
back
at
him
was
a
stranger
tousled
and
weary.
You
need
a
vacation,
Robert.
The
past
year
had
taken
a
heavy
toll
on
him,
but
he
didn't
appreciate
seeing
proof
in
the
mirror.
His
usually
sharp
blue
eyes
looked
hazy
and
drawn
tonight.
A
dark
stubble
was
shrouding
his
strong
jaw
and
dimpled
chin.
Around
his
temples,
the
gray
highlights
were
advancing,
making
their
way
deeper
into
his
thicket
of
coarse
black
hair.
Although
his
female
colleagues
insisted
the
gray
only
accentuated
his
bookish
appeal,
Langdon
knew
better.
"Boston
Magazine
could
see
me
now.
Last
month,
much
to
Langdon's
embarrassment,
Boston
Magazine
had
listed
him
as
one
of
that
city's
