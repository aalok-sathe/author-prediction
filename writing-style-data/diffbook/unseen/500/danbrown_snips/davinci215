the
home
of
Leigh
Teabing?
That
I
happen
to
live
there
is
why
the
Teacher
approached
me
in
the
first
place."
He
paused.
"How
do
you
think
the
Teacher
knows
so
much
about
the
Grail?"
Now
it
dawned,
and
Silas
was
stunned.
The
Teacher
had
recruited
a
servant
who
had
access
to
all
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
research.
It
was
brilliant.
"There
is
much
I
have
to
tell
you,"
Remy
said,
handing
Silas
the
loaded
Heckler
Koch
pistol.
Then
he
reached
through
the
open
partition
and
retrieved
a
small,
palm
sized
revolver
from
the
glove
box.
"But
first,
you
and
I
have
a
job
to
do."
Captain
Fache
descended
from
his
transport
plane
at
Biggin
Hill
and
listened
in
disbelief
to
the
Kent
chief
inspector's
account
of
what
had
happened
in
Teabing's
hangar.
"I
searched
the
plane
myself,"
the
inspector
insisted,
"and
there
was
no
one
inside."
His
tone
turned
haughty.
"And
I
should
add
that
if
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
presses
charges
against
me,
I
will
"Did
you
interrogate
the
pilot?"
"Of
course
not.
He
is
French,
and
our
jurisdiction
requires
"Take
me
to
the
plane."
Arriving
at
the
hangar,
Fache
needed
only
sixty
seconds
to
locate
an
anomalous
smear
of
blood
on
the
pavement
near
where
the
limousine
had
been
parked.
Fache
walked
up
to
the
plane
and
rapped
loudly
on
the
fuselage.
"This
is
the
captain
of
the
French
Judicial
Police.
Open
the
door!"
The
terrified
pilot
opened
the
hatch
and
lowered
the
stairs.
Fache
ascended.
Three
minutes
later,
with
the
help
of
his
sidearm,
he
had
a
full
confession,
including
a
description
of
the
bound
albino
monk.
In
addition,
he
learned
that
the
pilot
saw
Langdon
and
Sophie
leave
something
behind
in
Teabing's
safe,
a
wooden
box
of
some
sort.
Although
the
pilot
denied
knowing
what
was
in
the
box,
he
admitted
it
had
been
the
focus
of
Langdon's
full
attention
during
the
flight
to
London.
"Open
the
safe,"
Fache
demanded.
The
pilot
looked
terrified.
"I
don't
know
the
combination!"
"That's
too
bad.
I
was
going
to
offer
to
let
you
keep
your
pilot's
license."
The
pilot
wrung
his
hands.
"I
know
some
men
in
maintenance
here.
Maybe
they
could
drill
it?"
"You
have
half
an
hour."
The
pilot
leapt
for
his
radio.
Fache
strode
to
the
back
of
the
plane
and
poured
himself
a
hard
drink.
It
was
early,
but
he
had
not
yet
slept,
so
this
hardly
counted
as
drinking
before
noon.
Sitting
in
a
plush
bucket
seat,
he
closed
his
eyes,
trying
to
sort
out
what
was
going
on.
The
Kent
police's
blunder
could
cost
me
dearly.
Everyone
was
now
on
the
lookout
for
a
black
Jaguar
limousine.
Fache's
phone
rang,
and
he
wished
for
a
moment's
peace.
"Alio?"
"I'm
en
route
to
London."
It
was
Bishop
Aringarosa.
"I'll
be
arriving
in
an
hour."
Fache
sat
up.
"I
thought
you
were
going
to
Paris."
"I
am
deeply
concerned.
I
have
changed
my
plans."
"You
should
not
have."
"Do
you
have
Silas?"
"No.
His
captors
