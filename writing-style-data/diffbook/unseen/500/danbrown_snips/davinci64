to
the
South
Pole.
There
were,
of
course,
an
infinite
number
of
Rose
Lines
because
every
point
on
the
globe
could
have
a
longitude
drawn
through
it
connecting
north
and
south
poles.
The
question
for
early
navigators
was
which
of
these
lines
would
be
called
the
Rose
Line
the
zero
longitude
the
line
from
which
all
other
longitudes
on
earth
would
be
measured.
Today
that
line
was
in
Greenwich,
England.
But
it
had
not
always
been.
Long
before
the
establishment
of
Greenwich
as
the
prime
meridian,
the
zero
longitude
of
the
entire
world
had
passed
directly
through
Paris,
and
through
the
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice.
The
brass
marker
in
Saint
Sulpice
was
a
memorial
to
the
world's
first
prime
meridian,
and
although
Greenwich
had
stripped
Paris
of
the
honor
in
1888,
the
original
Rose
Line
was
still
visible
today.
"And
so
the
legend
is
true,"
the
Teacher
had
told
Silas.
"The
Priory
keystone
has
been
said
to
lie
'beneath
the
Sign
of
the
Rose.'
Now,
still
on
his
knees
in
a
pew,
Silas
glanced
around
the
church
and
listened
to
make
sure
no
one
was
there.
For
a
moment,
he
thought
he
heard
a
rustling
in
the
choir
balcony.
He
turned
and
gazed
up
for
several
seconds.
Nothing.
am
alone.
Standing
now,
he
faced
the
altar
and
genuflected
three
times.
Then
he
turned
left
and
followed
the
brass
line
due
north
toward
the
obelisk.
At
that
moment,
at
Leonardo
da
Vinci
International
Airport
in
Rome,
the
jolt
of
tires
hitting
the
runway
startled
Bishop
Aringarosa
from
his
slumber.
drifted
off,
he
thought,
impressed
he
was
relaxed
enough
to
sleep.
"Benvenuto
a
Roma,
"
the
intercom
announced.
Sitting
up,
Aringarosa
straightened
his
black
cassock
and
allowed
himself
a
rare
smile.
This
was
one
trip
he
had
been
happy
to
make.
have
been
on
the
defensive
for
too
long.
Tonight,
however,
the
rules
had
changed.
Only
five
months
ago,
Aringarosa
had
feared
for
the
future
of
the
Faith.
Now,
as
if
by
the
will
of
God,
the
solution
had
presented
itself.
Divine
intervention.
If
all
went
as
planned
tonight
in
Paris,
Aringarosa
would
soon
be
in
possession
of
something
that
would
make
him
the
most
powerful
man
in
Christendom.
Sophie
arrived
breathless
outside
the
large
wooden
doors
of
the
Salle
des
Etats
the
room
that
housed
the
Mona
Lisa.
Before
entering,
she
gazed
reluctantly
farther
down
the
hall,
twenty
yards
or
so,
to
the
spot
where
her
grandfather's
body
still
lay
under
the
spotlight.
The
remorse
that
gripped
her
was
powerful
and
sudden,
a
deep
sadness
laced
with
guilt.
The
man
had
reached
out
to
her
so
many
times
over
the
past
ten
years,
and
yet
Sophie
had
remained
immovable
leaving
his
letters
and
packages
unopened
in
a
bottom
drawer
and
denying
his
efforts
to
see
her.
He
lied
to
me!
Kept
appalling
secrets!
What
was
I
supposed
to
do
?
And
so
she
had
blocked
him
out.
Completely.
Now
her
grandfather
was
dead,
and
he
was
talking
to
her
from
the
