have
the
keystone!
They
will
reach
the
Grail
before
we
do!
In
the
stifling
darkness,
Silas
prayed.
He
let
the
pain
of
his
body
fuel
his
supplications.
A
miracle,
Lord.
I
need
a
miracle.
Silas
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
hours
from
now,
he
would
get
one.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
still
watching
him.
"A
funny
look
just
crossed
your
face."
Langdon
glanced
back
at
her,
realizing
his
jaw
was
firmly
set
and
his
heart
was
racing.
An
incredible
notion
had
just
occurred
to
him.
Could
it
really
be
that
simple
an
explanation?
"I
need
to
use
your
cell
phone,
Sophie."
"Now?"
"I
think
I
just
figured
something
out."
"What?"
"I'll
tell
you
in
a
minute.
I
need
your
phone."
Sophie
looked
wary.
"I
doubt
Fache
is
tracing,
but
keep
it
under
a
minute
just
in
case."
She
gave
him
her
phone.
"How
do
I
dial
the
States?"
"You
need
to
reverse
the
charges.
My
service
doesn't
cover
transatlantic."
Langdon
dialed
zero,
knowing
that
the
next
sixty
seconds
might
answer
a
question
that
had
been
puzzling
him
all
night.
New
York
editor
Jonas
Faukman
had
just
climbed
into
bed
for
the
night
when
the
telephone
rang.
A
little
late
for
callers,
he
grumbled,
picking
up
the
receiver.
An
operator's
voice
asked
him,
"Will
you
accept
charges
for
a
collect
call
from
Robert
Langdon?"
Puzzled,
Jonas
turned
on
the
light.
"Uh
sure,
okay."
The
line
clicked.
"Jonas?"
"Robert?
You
wake
me
up
and
you
charge
me
for
it?"
"Jonas,
forgive
me,"
Langdon
said.
"I'll
keep
this
very
short.
I
really
need
to
know.
The
manuscript
I
gave
you.
Have
you
"Robert,
I'm
sorry,
I
know
I
said
I'd
send
the
edits
out
to
you
this
week,
but
I'm
swamped.
Next
Monday.
I
promise."
"I'm
not
worried
about
the
edits.
I
need
to
know
if
you
sent
any
copies
out
for
blurbs
without
telling
me?"
Faukman
hesitated.
Langdon's
newest
manuscript
an
exploration
of
the
history
of
goddess
worship
included
several
sections
about
Mary
Magdalene
that
were
going
to
raise
some
eyebrows.
Although
the
material
was
well
documented
and
had
been
covered
by
others,
Faukman
had
no
intention
of
printing
Advance
Reading
Copies
of
Langdon's
book
without
at
least
a
few
endorsements
from
serious
historians
and
art
luminaries.
Jonas
had
chosen
ten
big
names
in
the
art
world
and
sent
them
all
sections
of
the
manuscript
along
with
a
polite
letter
asking
if
they
would
be
willing
to
write
a
short
endorsement
for
the
jacket.
In
Faukman's
experience,
most
people
jumped
at
the
opportunity
to
see
their
name
in
print.
"Jonas?"
Langdon
pressed.
"You
sent
out
my
manuscript,
didn't
you?"
Faukman
frowned,
sensing
Langdon
was
not
happy
about
it.
"The
manuscript
was
clean,
Robert,
and
I
wanted
to
surprise
you
with
some
terrific
blurbs."
A
pause.
"Did
you
send
one
to
the
curator
of
the
Paris
Louvre?"
"What
do
you
think?
Your
manuscript
referenced
his
Louvre
collection
several
times,
his
books
are
in
your
bibliography,
and
the
guy
has
some
serious
clout
