was
about
Jesus!'
Langdon
winked.
"There
are
symbols
hidden
in
places
you
would
never
imagine."
"Come
on,"
Sophie
whispered.
"What's
wrong?
We're
almost
there.
Hurry!"
Langdon
glanced
up,
feeling
himself
return
from
faraway
thoughts.
He
realized
he
was
standing
at
a
dead
stop
on
the
stairs,
paralyzed
by
sudden
revelation.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
Sophie
was
looking
back
at
him.
It
can
't
be
that
simple,
Langdon
thought.
But
he
knew
of
course
that
it
was.
There
in
the
bowels
of
the
Louvre
with
images
of
PHI
and
Da
Vinci
swirling
through
his
mind,
Robert
Langdon
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
deciphered
Sauniere's
code.
"O,
Draconian
devil!"
he
said.
"Oh,
lame
saint!
It's
the
simplest
kind
of
code!"
Sophie
was
stopped
on
the
stairs
below
him,
staring
up
in
confusion.
A
code?
She
had
been
pondering
the
words
all
night
and
had
not
seen
a
code.
Especially
a
simple
one.
"You
said
it
yourself."
Langdon's
voice
reverberated
with
excitement.
"Fibonacci
numbers
only
have
meaning
in
their
proper
order.
Otherwise
they're
mathematical
gibberish.
Sophie
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about.
The
Fibonacci
numbers?
She
was
certain
they
had
been
intended
as
nothing
more
than
a
means
to
get
the
Cryptography
Department
involved
tonight.
They
have
another
purpose?
She
plunged
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
printout,
studying
her
grandfather's
message
again.

O,
Draconian
devil
!
Oh,
lame
saint!
What
about
the
numbers
?
"The
scrambled
Fibonacci
sequence
is
a
clue,"
Langdon
said,
taking
the
printout.
"The
numbers
are
a
hint
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
rest
of
the
message.
He
wrote
the
sequence
out
of
order
to
tell
us
to
apply
the
same
concept
to
the
text.
O,
Draconian
devil?
Oh,
lame
saint?
Those
lines
mean
nothing.
They
are
simply
letters
written
out
of
order."
Sophie
needed
only
an
instant
to
process
Langdon's
implication,
and
it
seemed
laughably
simple.
"You
think
this
message
is
une
anagramme?"
She
stared
at
him.
"Like
a
word
jumble
from
a
newspaper?"
Langdon
could
see
the
skepticism
on
Sophie's
face
and
certainly
understood.
Few
people
realized
that
anagrams,
despite
being
a
trite
modern
amusement,
had
a
rich
history
of
sacred
symbolism.
The
mystical
teachings
of
the
Kabbala
drew
heavily
on
anagrams
rearranging
the
letters
of
Hebrew
words
to
derive
new
meanings.
French
kings
throughout
the
Renaissance
were
so
convinced
that
anagrams
held
magic
power
that
they
appointed
royal
anagrammatists
to
help
them
make
better
decisions
by
analyzing
words
in
important
documents.
The
Romans
actually
referred
to
the
study
of
anagrams
as
ars
magna
"the
great
art."
Langdon
looked
up
at
Sophie,
locking
eyes
with
her
now.
"Your
grandfather's
meaning
was
right
in
front
of
us
all
along,
and
he
left
us
more
than
enough
clues
to
see
it.
Without
another
word,
Langdon
pulled
a
pen
from
his
jacket
pocket
and
rearranged
the
letters
in
each
line.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
was
a
perfect
anagram
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci!
The
Mona
