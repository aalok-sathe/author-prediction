pleasure,"
Langdon
said.
"This
is
my
friend
Sophie
Neveu."
The
two
women
greeted
one
another,
and
Gettum
turned
immediately
back
to
Langdon.
"I
didn't
know
you
were
coming."
"Neither
did
we.
If
it's
not
too
much
trouble,
we
could
really
use
your
help
finding
some
information."
Gettum
shifted,
looking
uncertain.
"Normally
our
services
are
by
petition
and
appointment
only,
unless
of
course
you're
the
guest
of
someone
at
the
college?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"I'm
afraid
we've
come
unannounced.
A
friend
of
mine
speaks
very
highly
of
you.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing?"
Langdon
felt
a
pang
of
gloom
as
he
said
the
name.
"The
British
Royal
Historian."
Gettum
brightened
now,
laughing.
"Heavens,
yes.
What
a
character.
Fanatical!
Every
time
he
comes
in,
it's
always
the
same
search
strings.
Grail.
Grail.
Grail.
I
swear
that
man
will
die
before
he
gives
up
on
that
quest."
She
winked.
"Time
and
money
afford
one
such
lovely
luxuries,
wouldn't
you
say?
A
regular
Don
Quixote,
that
one."
"Is
there
any
chance
you
can
help
us?"
Sophie
asked.
"It's
quite
important."
Gettum
glanced
around
the
deserted
library
and
then
winked
at
them
both.
"Well,
I
can't
very
well
claim
I'm
too
busy,
now
can
I?
As
long
as
you
sign
in,
I
can't
imagine
anyone
being
too
upset.
What
did
you
have
in
mind?"
"We're
trying
to
find
a
tomb
in
London."
Gettum
looked
dubious.
"We've
got
about
twenty
thousand
of
them.
Can
you
be
a
little
more
specific?"
"It's
the
tomb
of
a
knight.
We
don't
have
a
name."
"A
knight.
That
tightens
the
net
substantially.
Much
less
common."
"We
don't
have
much
information
about
the
knight
we're
looking
for,"
Sophie
said,
"but
this
is
what
we
know."
She
produced
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
she
had
written
only
the
first
two
lines
of
the
poem.
Hesitant
to
show
the
entire
poem
to
an
outsider,
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
decided
to
share
just
the
first
two
lines,
those
that
identified
the
knight.
Compartmentalized
cryptography,
Sophie
had
called
it.
When
an
intelligence
agency
intercepted
a
code
containing
sensitive
data,
cryptographers
each
worked
on
a
discrete
section
of
the
code.
This
way,
when
they
broke
it,
no
single
cryptographer
possessed
the
entire
deciphered
message.
In
this
case,
the
precaution
was
probably
excessive;
even
if
this
librarian
saw
the
entire
poem,
identified
the
knight's
tomb,
and
knew
what
orb
was
missing,
the
information
was
useless
without
the
cryptex.
Gettum
sensed
an
urgency
in
the
eyes
of
this
famed
American
scholar,
almost
as
if
his
finding
this
tomb
quickly
were
a
matter
of
critical
importance.
The
green
eyed
woman
accompanying
him
also
seemed
anxious.
Puzzled,
Gettum
put
on
her
glasses
and
examined
the
paper
they
had
just
handed
her.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
She
glanced
at
her
guests.
"What
is
this?
Some
kind
of
Harvard
scavenger
hunt?"
Langdon's
laugh
sounded
forced.
"Yeah,
something
like
that."
Gettum
paused,
feeling
she
was
not
getting
the
whole
story.
Nonetheless,
she
