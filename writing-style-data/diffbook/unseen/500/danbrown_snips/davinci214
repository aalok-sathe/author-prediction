have
been
praying
all
night
for
liberation.
Now,
as
the
knife
descended,
Silas
clenched
his
eyes
shut.
A
slash
of
pain
tore
through
his
shoulder
blades.
He
cried
out,
unable
to
believe
he
was
going
to
die
here
in
the
back
of
this
limousine,
unable
to
defend
himself.
was
doing
God's
work.
The
Teacher
said
he
would
protect
me.
Silas
felt
the
biting
warmth
spreading
across
his
back
and
shoulders
and
could
picture
his
own
blood,
spilling
out
over
his
flesh.
A
piercing
pain
cut
through
his
thighs
now,
and
he
felt
the
onset
of
that
familiar
undertow
of
disorientation
the
body's
defense
mechanism
against
the
pain.
As
the
biting
heat
tore
through
all
of
his
muscles
now,
Silas
clenched
his
eyes
tighter,
determined
that
the
final
image
of
his
life
would
not
be
of
his
own
killer.
Instead
he
pictured
a
younger
Bishop
Aringarosa,
standing
before
the
small
church
in
Spain
the
church
that
he
and
Silas
had
built
with
their
own
hands.
The
beginning
of
my
life.
Silas
felt
as
if
his
body
were
on
fire.
"Take
a
drink,"
the
tuxedoed
man
whispered,
his
accent
French.
"It
will
help
with
your
circulation."
Silas's
eyes
flew
open
in
surprise.
A
blurry
image
was
leaning
over
him,
offering
a
glass
of
liquid.
A
mound
of
shredded
duct
tape
lay
on
the
floor
beside
the
bloodless
knife.
"Drink
this,"
he
repeated.
"The
pain
you
feel
is
the
blood
rushing
into
your
muscles."
Silas
felt
the
fiery
throb
transforming
now
to
a
prickling
sting.
The
vodka
tasted
terrible,
but
he
drank
it,
feeling
grateful.
Fate
had
dealt
Silas
a
healthy
share
of
bad
luck
tonight,
but
God
had
solved
it
all
with
one
miraculous
twist.
God
has
not
forsaken
me.
Silas
knew
what
Bishop
Aringarosa
would
call
it.
Divine
intervention.
"I
had
wanted
to
free
you
earlier,"
the
servant
apologized,
"but
it
was
impossible.
With
the
police
arriving
at
Chateau
Villette,
and
then
at
Biggin
Hill
airport,
this
was
the
first
possible
moment.
You
understand,
don't
you,
Silas?"
Silas
recoiled,
startled.
"You
know
my
name?"
The
servant
smiled.
Silas
sat
up
now,
rubbing
his
stiff
muscles,
his
emotions
a
torrent
of
incredulity,
appreciation,
and
confusion.
"Are
you
the
Teacher?"
Remy
shook
his
head,
laughing
at
the
proposition.
"I
wish
I
had
that
kind
of
power.
No,
I
am
not
the
Teacher.
Like
you,
I
serve
him.
But
the
Teacher
speaks
highly
of
you.
My
name
is
Remy."
Silas
was
amazed.
"I
don't
understand.
If
you
work
for
the
Teacher,
why
did
Langdon
bring
the
keystone
to
your
home?"
"Not
my
home.
The
home
of
the
world's
foremost
Grail
historian,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing."
"But
you
live
there.
The
odds"
Remy
smiled,
seeming
to
have
no
trouble
with
the
apparent
coincidence
of
Langdon's
chosen
refuge.
"It
was
all
utterly
predictable.
Robert
Langdon
was
in
possession
of
the
keystone,
and
he
needed
help.
What
more
logical
place
to
run
than
to
