referring
to.
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars."
"Okay,"
Sophie
said,
"but
if
Baphomet
is
the
headstone
praised
by
Templars,
then
we
have
a
new
dilemma."
She
pointed
to
the
dials
on
the
cryptex.
"Baphomet
has
eight
letters.
We
only
have
room
for
five.
Teabing
grinned
broadly.
"My
dear,
this
is
where
the
Atbash
Cipher
comes
into
play"
Langdon
was
impressed.
Teabing
had
just
finished
writing
out
the
entire
twenty
two
letter
Hebrew
alphabet
alef
beit
from
memory.
Granted,
he'd
used
Roman
equivalents
rather
than
Hebrew
characters,
but
even
so,
he
was
now
reading
through
them
with
flawless
pronunciation.

"Alef,

"
Teabing
dramatically
mopped
his
brow
and
plowed
on.
"In
formal
Hebrew
spelling,
the
vowel
sounds
are
not
written.
Therefore,
when
we
write
the
word
Baphomet
using
the
Hebrew
alphabet,
it
will
lose
its
three
vowels
in
translation,
leaving
us
"Five
letters,"
Sophie
blurted.
Teabing
nodded
and
began
writing
again.
"Okay,
here
is
the
proper
spelling
of
Baphomet
in
Hebrew
letters.
I'll
sketch
in
the
missing
vowels
for
clarity's
sake.

"Remember,
of
course,"
he
added,
"that
Hebrew
is
normally
written
in
the
opposite
direction,
but
we
can
just
as
easily
use
Atbash
this
way.
Next,
all
we
have
to
do
is
create
our
substitution
scheme
by
rewriting
the
entire
alphabet
in
reverse
order
opposite
the
original
alphabet."
"There's
an
easier
way,"
Sophie
said,
taking
the
pen
from
Teabing.
"It
works
for
all
reflectional
substitution
ciphers,
including
the
Atbash.
A
little
trick
I
learned
at
the
Royal
Holloway."
Sophie
wrote
the
first
half
of
the
alphabet
from
left
to
right,
and
then,
beneath
it,
wrote
the
second
half,
right
to
left.
"Cryptanalysts
call
it
the
fold
over.
Half
as
complicated.
Twice
as
clean."

Teabing
eyed
her
handiwork
and
chuckled.
"Right
you
are.
Glad
to
see
those
boys
at
the
Holloway
are
doing
their
job."
Looking
at
Sophie's
substitution
matrix,
Langdon
felt
a
rising
thrill
that
he
imagined
must
have
rivaled
the
thrill
felt
by
early
scholars
when
they
first
used
the
Atbash
Cipher
to
decrypt
the
now
famous
Mystery
of
Sheshach.
For
years,
religious
scholars
had
been
baffled
by
biblical
references
to
a
city
called
Sheshach.
The
city
did
not
appear
on
any
map
nor
in
any
other
documents,
and
yet
it
was
mentioned
repeatedly
in
the
Book
of
Jeremiah
the
king
of
Sheshach,
the
city
of
Sheshach,
the
people
of
Sheshach.
Finally,
a
scholar
applied
the
Atbash
Cipher
to
the
word,
and
his
results
were
mind
numbing.
The
cipher
revealed
that
Sheshach
was
in
fact
a
code
word
for
another
very
well
known
city.
The
decryption
process
was
simple.
Sheshach,
in
Hebrew,
was
spelled:
Sh
Sh
K.
Sh
Sh
K,
when
placed
in
the
substitution
matrix,
became
