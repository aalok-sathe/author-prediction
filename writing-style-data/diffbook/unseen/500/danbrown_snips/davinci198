unrolled
the
scroll
and
revealed
what
was
wrapped
inside.
"For
this.
When
Langdon
saw
the
object
inside
the
sheet
of
vellum,
his
heart
sank.
"God
help
us,"
Teabing
said,
slumping.
"Your
grandfather
was
a
pitiless
architect."
Langdon
stared
in
amazement.
see
Sauniere
has
no
intention
of
making
this
easy.
On
the
table
sat
a
second
cryptex.
Smaller.
Made
of
black
onyx.
It
had
been
nested
within
the
first.
Sauniere's
passion
for
dualism.
Two
cryptexes.
Everything
in
pairs.
Double
entendres.
Male
female.
Black
nested
within
white.
Langdon
felt
the
web
of
symbolism
stretching
onward.
White
gives
birth
to
black.
Every
man
sprang
from
woman.
White
female.
Black
male.
Reaching
over,
Langdon
lifted
the
smaller
cryptex.
It
looked
identical
to
the
first,
except
half
the
size
and
black.
He
heard
the
familiar
gurgle.
Apparently,
the
vial
of
vinegar
they
had
heard
earlier
was
inside
this
smaller
cryptex.
"Well,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
sliding
the
page
of
vellum
over
to
him.
"You'll
be
pleased
to
hear
that
at
least
we're
flying
in
the
right
direction."
Langdon
examined
the
thick
vellum
sheet.
Written
in
ornate
penmanship
was
another
four
line
verse.
Again,
in
iambic
pentameter.
The
verse
was
cryptic,
but
Langdon
needed
to
read
only
as
far
as
the
first
line
to
realize
that
Teabing's
plan
to
come
to
Britain
was
going
to
pay
off.
IN
LONDON
LIES
A
KNIGHT
A
POPE
INTERRED.
The
remainder
of
the
poem
clearly
implied
that
the
password
for
opening
the
second
cryptex
could
be
found
by
visiting
this
knight's
tomb,
somewhere
in
the
city.
Langdon
turned
excitedly
to
Teabing.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what
knight
this
poem
is
referring
t0?
Teabing
grinned.
"Not
the
foggiest.
But
I
know
in
precisely
which
crypt
we
should
look."
At
that
moment,
fifteen
miles
ahead
of
them,
six
Kent
police
cars
streaked
down
rain
soaked
streets
toward
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport.
Lieutenant
Collet
helped
himself
to
a
Perrier
from
Teabing's
refrigerator
and
strode
back
out
through
the
drawing
room.
Rather
than
accompanying
Fache
to
London
where
the
action
was,
he
was
now
baby
sitting
the
PTS
team
that
had
spread
out
through
Chateau
Villette.
So
far,
the
evidence
they
had
uncovered
was
unhelpful:
a
single
bullet
buried
in
the
floor;
a
paper
with
several
symbols
scrawled
on
it
along
with
the
words
blade
and
chalice;
and
a
bloody
spiked
belt
that
PTS
had
told
Collet
was
associated
with
the
conservative
Catholic
group
Opus
Dei,
which
had
caused
a
stir
recently
when
a
news
program
exposed
their
aggressive
recruiting
practices
in
Paris.
Collet
sighed.
Good
luck
making
sense
of
this
unlikely
melange.
Moving
down
a
lavish
hallway,
Collet
entered
the
vast
ballroom
study,
where
the
chief
PTS
examiner
was
busy
dusting
for
fingerprints.
He
was
a
corpulent
man
in
suspenders.
"Anything?"
Collet
asked,
entering.
The
examiner
shook
his
head.
"Nothing
new.
Multiple
sets
matching
those
in
the
rest
of
the
house."
"How
about
the
prints
on
the
cilice
belt?"
"Interpol
is
still
working.
I
uploaded
everything
we
found."
Collet
motioned
to
two
sealed
