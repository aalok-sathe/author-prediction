was
interesting."
Sophie
didn't
seem
to
hear.
Her
eyes
remained
fixed
ahead
down
the
long
thoroughfare
of
Champs
Elysees,
the
two
mile
stretch
of
posh
storefronts
that
was
often
called
the
Fifth
Avenue
of
Paris.
The
embassy
was
only
about
a
mile
away,
and
Langdon
settled
into
his
seat.
So
dark
the
con
of
man.
Sophie's
quick
thinking
had
been
impressive.
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
Sophie
had
said
her
grandfather
left
her
something
behind
the
painting.
A
final
message?
Langdon
could
not
help
but
marvel
over
Sauniere's
brilliant
hiding
place;
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
was
yet
another
fitting
link
in
the
evening's
chain
of
interconnected
symbolism.
Sauniere,
it
seemed,
at
every
turn,
was
reinforcing
his
fondness
for
the
dark
and
mischievous
side
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Da
Vinci's
original
commission
for
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
had
come
from
an
organization
known
as
the
Confraternity
of
the
Immaculate
Conception,
which
needed
a
painting
for
the
centerpiece
of
an
altar
triptych
in
their
church
of
San
Francesco
in
Milan.
The
nuns
gave
Leonardo
specific
dimensions,
and
the
desired
theme
for
the
painting
the
Virgin
Mary,
baby
John
the
Baptist,
Uriel,
and
Baby
Jesus
sheltering
in
a
cave.
Although
Da
Vinci
did
as
they
requested,
when
he
delivered
the
work,
the
group
reacted
with
horror.
He
had
filled
the
painting
with
explosive
and
disturbing
details.
The
painting
showed
a
blue
robed
Virgin
Mary
sitting
with
her
arm
around
an
infant
child,
presumably
Baby
Jesus.
Opposite
Mary
sat
Uriel,
also
with
an
infant,
presumably
baby
John
the
Baptist.
Oddly,
though,
rather
than
the
usual
Jesus
blessing
John
scenario,
it
was
baby
John
who
was
blessing
Jesus
and
Jesus
was
submitting
to
his
authority!
More
troubling
still,
Mary
was
holding
one
hand
high
above
the
head
of
infant
John
and
making
a
decidedly
threatening
gesture
her
fingers
looking
like
eagle's
talons,
gripping
an
invisible
head.
Finally,
the
most
obvious
and
frightening
image:
Just
below
Mary's
curled
fingers,
Uriel
was
making
a
cutting
gesture
with
his
hand
as
if
slicing
the
neck
of
the
invisible
head
gripped
by
Mary's
claw
like
hand.
Langdon's
students
were
always
amused
to
learn
that
Da
Vinci
eventually
mollified
the
confraternity
by
painting
them
a
second,
"watered
down"
version
of
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
in
which
everyone
was
arranged
in
a
more
orthodox
manner.
The
second
version
now
hung
in
London's
National
Gallery
under
the
name
Virgin
of
the
Rocks,
although
Langdon
still
preferred
the
Louvre's
more
intriguing
original.
As
Sophie
gunned
the
car
up
Champs
Elysees,
Langdon
said,
"The
painting.
What
was
behind
it?"
Her
eyes
remained
on
the
road.
"I'll
show
you
once
we're
safely
inside
the
embassy."
"You'll
show
it
to
me?"
Langdon
was
surprised.
"He
left
you
a
physical
object?"
Sophie
gave
a
curt
nod.
"Embossed
with
a
fleur
de
lis
and
the
initials
P.S."
Langdon
couldn't
believe
his
ears.
We're
going
to
make
it,
Sophie
thought
as
she
swung
the
SmartCar's
wheel
to
the
right,
cutting
sharply
past
the
luxurious
Hotel
de
Crillon
into
Paris's
tree
