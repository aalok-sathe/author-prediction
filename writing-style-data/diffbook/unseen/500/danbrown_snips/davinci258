before
him.
"No,"
he
said,
his
eyes
hardening
as
he
turned
to
Leigh.
"Not
until
he
lets
you
go."
Teabing's
optimism
darkened.
"We
are
so
close,
Robert.
Don't
you
dare
start
playing
games
with
me!"
"No
games,"
Langdon
said.
"Let
her
go.
Then
I'll
take
you
to
Newton's
tomb.
We'll
open
the
cryptex
together."
"I'm
not
going
anywhere,"
Sophie
declared,
her
eyes
narrowing
with
rage.
"That
cryptex
was
given
to
me
by
my
grandfather.
It
is
not
yours
to
open."
Langdon
wheeled,
looking
fearful.
"Sophie,
please!
You're
in
danger.
I'm
trying
to
help
you!"
"How?
By
unveiling
the
secret
my
grandfather
died
trying
to
protect?
He
trusted
you,
Robert.
trusted
you!"
Langdon's
blue
eyes
showed
panic
now,
and
Teabing
could
not
help
but
smile
to
see
the
two
of
them
working
against
one
another.
Langdon's
attempts
to
be
gallant
were
more
pathetic
than
anything.
On
the
verge
of
unveiling
one
of
history's
greatest
secrets,
and
he
troubles
himself
with
a
woman
who
has
proven
herself
unworthy
of
the
quest.
"Sophie,"
Langdon
pleaded.
"Please
you
must
leave."
She
shook
her
head.
"Not
unless
you
either
hand
me
the
cryptex
or
smash
it
on
the
floor."
"What?"
Langdon
gasped.
"Robert,
my
grandfather
would
prefer
his
secret
lost
forever
than
see
it
in
the
hands
of
his
murderer."
Sophie's
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
well
with
tears,
but
they
did
not.
She
stared
directly
back
at
Teabing.
"Shoot
me
if
you
have
to.
I
am
not
leaving
my
grandfather's
legacy
in
your
hands."
Very
well.
Teabing
aimed
the
weapon.
"No!"
Langdon
shouted,
raising
his
arm
and
suspending
the
cryptex
precariously
over
the
hard
stone
floor.
"Leigh,
if
you
even
think
about
it,
I
will
drop
this."
Teabing
laughed.
"That
bluff
worked
on
Remy.
Not
on
me.
I
know
you
better
than
that."
"Do
you,
Leigh?"
Yes
I
do.
Your
poker
face
needs
work,
my
friend.
It
took
me
several
seconds,
but
I
can
see
now
that
you
are
lying.
You
have
no
idea
where
on
Newton
's
tomb
the
answer
lies.
"Truly,
Robert?
You
know
where
on
the
tomb
to
look?"
"Ida"
The
falter
in
Langdon's
eyes
was
fleeting
but
Leigh
caught
it.
There
was
a
lie
there.
A
desperate,
pathetic
ploy
to
save
Sophie.
Teabing
felt
a
profound
disappointment
in
Robert
Langdon.
am
a
lone
knight,
surrounded
by
unworthy
souls.
And
I
will
have
to
decipher
the
keystone
on
my
own.
Langdon
and
Neveu
were
nothing
but
a
threat
to
Teabing
now
and
to
the
Grail.
As
painful
as
the
solution
was
going
to
be,
he
knew
he
could
carry
it
out
with
a
clean
conscience.
The
only
challenge
would
be
to
persuade
Langdon
to
set
down
the
keystone
so
Teabing
could
safely
end
this
charade.
"A
show
of
faith,"
Teabing
said,
lowering
the
gun
from
Sophie.
"Set
down
the
keystone,
and
we'll
talk."
Langdon
knew
his
lie
had
failed.
He
could
see
the
dark
resolve
in
Teabing's
face
and
knew
the
moment
was
upon
them.
When
I
set
this
down,
