deepened.
Sophie
wondered
if
maybe
he
had
fallen
terminally
ill
and
had
decided
to
attempt
any
ploy
he
could
think
of
to
get
Sophie
to
visit
him
one
last
time.
If
so,
he
had
chosen
wisely.
My
family.
Now,
standing
in
the
darkness
of
the
Louvre
men's
room,
Sophie
could
hear
the
echoes
of
this
afternoon's
phone
message.
Sophie,
we
both
may
be
in
danger.
Call
me.
She
had
not
called
him.
Nor
had
she
planned
to.
Now,
however,
her
skepticism
had
been
deeply
challenged.
Her
grandfather
lay
murdered
inside
his
own
museum.
And
he
had
written
a
code
on
the
floor.
A
code
for
her.
Of
this,
she
was
certain.
Despite
not
understanding
the
meaning
of
his
message,
Sophie
was
certain
its
cryptic
nature
was
additional
proof
that
the
words
were
intended
for
her.
Sophie's
passion
and
aptitude
for
cryptography
were
a
product
of
growing
up
with
Jacques
Sauniere
a
fanatic
himself
for
codes,
word
games,
and
puzzles.
How
many
Sundays
did
we
spend
doing
the
cryptograms
and
crosswords
in
the
newspaper?
At
the
age
of
twelve,
Sophie
could
finish
the
he
Monde
crossword
without
any
help,
and
her
grandfather
graduated
her
to
crosswords
in
English,
mathematical
puzzles,
and
substitution
ciphers.
Sophie
devoured
them
all.
Eventually
she
turned
her
passion
into
a
profession
by
becoming
a
codebreaker
for
the
Judicial
Police.
Tonight,
the
cryptographer
in
Sophie
was
forced
to
respect
the
efficiency
with
which
her
grandfather
had
used
a
simple
code
to
unite
two
total
strangers
Sophie
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon.
The
question
was
why?
Unfortunately,
from
the
bewildered
look
in
Langdon's
eyes,
Sophie
sensed
the
American
had
no
more
idea
than
she
did
why
her
grandfather
had
thrown
them
together.
She
pressed
again.
"You
and
my
grandfather
had
planned
to
meet
tonight.
What
about?"
Langdon
looked
truly
perplexed.
"His
secretary
set
the
meeting
and
didn't
offer
any
specific
reason,
and
I
didn't
ask.
I
assumed
he'd
heard
I
would
be
lecturing
on
the
pagan
iconography
of
French
cathedrals,
was
interested
in
the
topic,
and
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
meet
for
drinks
after
the
talk."
Sophie
didn't
buy
it.
The
connection
was
flimsy.
Her
grandfather
knew
more
about
pagan
iconography
than
anyone
else
on
earth.
Moreover,
he
an
exceptionally
private
man,
not
someone
prone
to
chatting
with
random
American
professors
unless
there
were
an
important
reason.
Sophie
took
a
deep
breath
and
probed
further.
"My
grandfather
called
me
this
afternoon
and
told
me
he
and
I
were
in
grave
danger.
Does
that
mean
anything
to
you?"
Langdon's
blue
eyes
now
clouded
with
concern.
"No,
but
considering
what
just
happened"
Sophie
nodded.
Considering
tonight's
events,
she
would
be
a
fool
not
to
be
frightened.
Feeling
drained,
she
walked
to
the
small
plate
glass
window
at
the
far
end
of
the
bathroom
and
gazed
out
in
silence
through
the
mesh
of
alarm
tape
embedded
in
the
glass.
They
were
high
up
forty
feet
at
least.
Sighing,
she
raised
her
eyes
and
gazed
out
at
Paris's
dazzling
landscape.
On
her
