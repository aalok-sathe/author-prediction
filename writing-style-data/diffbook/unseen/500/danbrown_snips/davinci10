could
see
the
faint
illuminated
wisps
of
mist
from
the
fountains
fading
away
outside
the
transparent
roof.
"Do
you
approve?"
Fache
asked,
nodding
upward
with
his
broad
chin.
Langdon
sighed,
too
tired
to
play
games.
"Yes,
your
pyramid
is
magnificent."
Fache
grunted.
"A
scar
on
the
face
of
Paris."
Strike
one.
Langdon
sensed
his
host
was
a
hard
man
to
please.
He
wondered
if
Fache
had
any
idea
that
this
pyramid,
at
President
Mitterrand's
explicit
demand,
had
been
constructed
of
exactly
666
panes
of
glass
a
bizarre
request
that
had
always
been
a
hot
topic
among
conspiracy
buffs
who
claimed
666
was
the
number
of
Satan.
Langdon
decided
not
to
bring
it
up.
As
they
dropped
farther
into
the
subterranean
foyer,
the
yawning
space
slowly
emerged
from
the
shadows.
Built
fifty
seven
feet
beneath
ground
level,
the
Louvre's
newly
constructed
70,000
square
foot
lobby
spread
out
like
an
endless
grotto.
Constructed
in
warm
ocher
marble
to
be
compatible
with
the
honey
colored
stone
of
the
Louvre
facade
above,
the
subterranean
hall
was
usually
vibrant
with
sunlight
and
tourists.
Tonight,
however,
the
lobby
was
barren
and
dark,
giving
the
entire
space
a
cold
and
crypt
like
atmosphere.
"And
the
museum's
regular
security
staff?"
Langdon
asked.
"En
quarantaine,
"
Fache
replied,
sounding
as
if
Langdon
were
questioning
the
integrity
of
Fache's
team.
"Obviously,
someone
gained
entry
tonight
who
should
not
have.
All
Louvre
night
wardens
are
in
the
Sully
Wing
being
questioned.
My
own
agents
have
taken
over
museum
security
for
the
evening."
Langdon
nodded,
moving
quickly
to
keep
pace
with
Fache.
"How
well
did
you
know
Jacques
Sauniere?"
the
captain
asked.
"Actually,
not
at
all.
We'd
never
met."
Fache
looked
surprised.
"Your
first
meeting
was
to
be
tonight?"
"Yes.
We'd
planned
to
meet
at
the
American
University
reception
following
my
lecture,
but
he
never
showed
up."
Fache
scribbled
some
notes
in
a
little
book.
As
they
walked,
Langdon
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
Louvre's
lesser
known
pyramid
La
Pyramide
Inversee
a
huge
inverted
skylight
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
like
a
stalactite
in
an
adjoining
section
of
the
entresol.
Fache
guided
Langdon
up
a
short
set
of
stairs
to
the
mouth
of
an
arched
tunnel,
over
which
a
sign
read:
DENON.
The
Denon
Wing
was
the
most
famous
of
the
Louvre's
three
main
sections.
"Who
requested
tonight's
meeting?"
Fache
asked
suddenly.
"You
or
he?"
The
question
seemed
odd.
"Mr.
Sauniere
did,"
Langdon
replied
as
they
entered
the
tunnel.
"His
secretary
contacted
me
a
few
weeks
ago
via
e
mail.
She
said
the
curator
had
heard
I
would
be
lecturing
in
Paris
this
month
and
wanted
to
discuss
something
with
me
while
I
was
here."
"Discuss
what?"
"I
don't
know.
Art,
I
imagine.
We
share
similar
interests."
Fache
looked
skeptical.
"You
have
no
idea
what
your
meeting
was
about?"
Langdon
did
not.
He'd
been
curious
at
the
time
but
had
not
felt
comfortable
demanding
specifics.
The
venerated
Jacques
Sauniere
had
a
renowned
penchant
for
privacy
and
granted
very
few
meetings;
Langdon
was
