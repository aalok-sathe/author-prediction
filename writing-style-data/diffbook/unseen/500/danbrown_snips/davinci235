his
throat
and
tasting
vomit
in
his
narrowing
esophagus.
He
let
out
a
muted
croak
of
a
scream,
not
even
loud
enough
to
be
heard
outside
the
car.
The
saltiness
in
the
cognac
now
registered.
I'm
being
murdered!
Incredulous,
Remy
turned
to
see
the
Teacher
sitting
calmly
beside
him,
staring
straight
ahead
out
the
windshield.
Remy's
eyesight
blurred,
and
he
gasped
for
breath.
I
made
everything
possible
for
him!
How
could
he
do
this!
Whether
the
Teacher
had
intended
to
kill
Remy
all
along
or
whether
it
had
been
Remy's
actions
in
the
Temple
Church
that
had
made
the
Teacher
lose
faith,
Remy
would
never
know.
Terror
and
rage
coursed
through
him
now.
Remy
tried
to
lunge
for
the
Teacher,
but
his
stiffening
body
could
barely
move.
trusted
you
with
everything!
Remy
tried
to
lift
his
clenched
fists
to
blow
the
horn,
but
instead
he
slipped
sideways,
rolling
onto
the
seat,
lying
on
his
side
beside
the
Teacher,
clutching
at
his
throat.
The
rain
fell
harder
now.
Remy
could
no
longer
see,
but
he
could
sense
his
oxygen
deprived
brain
straining
to
cling
to
his
last
faint
shreds
of
lucidity.
As
his
world
slowly
went
black,
Remy
Legaludec
could
have
sworn
he
heard
the
sounds
of
the
soft
Riviera
surf.
The
Teacher
stepped
from
the
limousine,
pleased
to
see
that
nobody
was
looking
in
his
direction.
had
no
choice,
he
told
himself,
surprised
how
little
remorse
he
felt
for
what
he
had
just
done.
Remy
sealed
his
own
fate.
The
Teacher
had
feared
all
along
that
Remy
might
need
to
be
eliminated
when
the
mission
was
complete,
but
by
brazenly
showing
himself
in
the
Temple
Church,
Remy
had
accelerated
the
necessity
dramatically.
Robert
Langdon's
unexpected
visit
to
Chateau
Villette
had
brought
the
Teacher
both
a
fortuitous
windfall
and
an
intricate
dilemma.
Langdon
had
delivered
the
keystone
directly
to
the
heart
of
the
operation,
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise,
and
yet
he
had
brought
the
police
on
his
tail.
Remy's
prints
were
all
over
Chateau
Villette,
as
well
as
in
the
barn's
listening
post,
where
Remy
had
carried
out
the
surveillance.
The
Teacher
was
grateful
he
had
taken
so
much
care
in
preventing
any
ties
between
Remy's
activities
and
his
own.
Nobody
could
implicate
the
Teacher
unless
Remy
talked,
and
that
was
no
longer
a
concern.
One
more
loose
end
to
tie
up
here,
the
Teacher
thought,
moving
now
toward
the
rear
door
of
the
limousine.
The
police
will
have
no
idea
what
happened
and
no
living
witness
left
to
tell
them.
Glancing
around
to
ensure
nobody
was
watching,
he
pulled
open
the
door
and
climbed
into
the
spacious
rear
compartment.
Minutes
later,
the
Teacher
was
crossing
St.
James's
Park.
Only
two
people
now
remain.
Langdon
and
Neveu.
They
were
more
complicated.
But
manageable.
At
the
moment,
however,
the
Teacher
had
the
cryptex
to
attend
to.
Gazing
triumphantly
across
the
park,
he
could
see
his
destination.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
As
soon
as
the
Teacher
had
heard
