been
speaking
to
him.
"What
do
you
think
we
should
do
with
the
Sangreal
documents
if
we
ever
find
them?"
she
whispered.
"What
I
think
is
immaterial,"
Langdon
said.
"Your
grandfather
gave
the
cryptex
to
you,
and
you
should
do
with
it
what
your
instinct
tells
you
he
would
want
done."
"I'm
asking
for
your
opinion.
You
obviously
wrote
something
in
that
manuscript
that
made
my
grandfather
trust
your
judgment.
He
scheduled
a
private
meeting
with
you.
That's
rare."
"Maybe
he
wanted
to
tell
me
I
have
it
all
wrong."
"Why
would
he
tell
me
to
find
you
unless
he
liked
your
ideas?
In
your
manuscript,
did
you
support
the
idea
that
the
Sangreal
documents
should
be
revealed
or
stay
buried?"
"Neither.
I
made
no
judgment
either
way.
The
manuscript
deals
with
the
symbology
of
the
sacred
feminine
tracing
her
iconography
throughout
history.
I
certainly
didn't
presume
to
know
where
the
Grail
is
hidden
or
whether
it
should
ever
be
revealed.
"And
yet
you're
writing
a
book
about
it,
so
you
obviously
feel
the
information
should
be
shared."
"There's
an
enormous
difference
between
hypothetically
discussing
an
alternate
history
of
Christ,
and"
He
paused.
"And
what?"
"And
presenting
to
the
world
thousands
of
ancient
documents
as
scientific
evidence
that
the
New
Testament
is
false
testimony."
"But
you
told
me
the
New
Testament
is
based
on
fabrications."
Langdon
smiled.
"Sophie,
every
faith
in
the
world
is
based
on
fabrication.
That
is
the
definition
of
faith
acceptance
of
that
which
we
imagine
to
be
true,
that
which
we
cannot
prove.
Every
religion
describes
God
through
metaphor,
allegory,
and
exaggeration,
from
the
early
Egyptians
through
modern
Sunday
school.
Metaphors
are
a
way
to
help
our
minds
process
the
unprocessible.
The
problems
arise
when
we
begin
to
believe
literally
in
our
own
metaphors."
"So
you
are
in
favor
of
the
Sangreal
documents
staying
buried
forever?"
"I'm
a
historian.
I'm
opposed
to
the
destruction
of
documents,
and
I
would
love
to
see
religious
scholars
have
more
information
to
ponder
the
exceptional
life
of
Jesus
Christ."
"You're
arguing
both
sides
of
my
question."
"Am
I?
The
Bible
represents
a
fundamental
guidepost
for
millions
of
people
on
the
planet,
in
much
the
same
way
the
Koran,
Torah,
and
Pali
Canon
offer
guidance
to
people
of
other
religions.
If
you
and
I
could
dig
up
documentation
that
contradicted
the
holy
stories
of
Islamic
belief,
Judaic
belief,
Buddhist
belief,
pagan
belief,
should
we
do
that?
Should
we
wave
a
flag
and
tell
the
Buddhists
that
we
have
proof
the
Buddha
did
not
come
from
a
lotus
blossom?
Or
that
Jesus
was
not
born
of
a
literal
virgin
birth?
Those
who
truly
understand
their
faiths
understand
the
stories
are
metaphorical."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"My
friends
who
are
devout
Christians
definitely
believe
that
Christ
literally
walked
on
water,
literally
turned
water
into
wine,
and
was
born
of
a
literal
virgin
birth."
"My
point
exactly,"
Langdon
said.
"Religious
allegory
has
become
apart
of
the
fabric
of
reality.
And
living
in
that
reality
helps
