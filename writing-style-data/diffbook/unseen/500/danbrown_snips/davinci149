is!"
Sophie
was
certain
she
had
missed
something.
"That's
the
same
painting
you
just
showed
me."
He
winked.
"I
know,
but
the
enlargement
is
so
much
more
exciting.
Don't
you
think?"
Sophie
turned
to
Langdon
for
help.
"I'm
lost."
Langdon
smiled.
"As
it
turns
out,
the
Holy
Grail
does
indeed
make
an
appearance
in
The
Last
Supper.
Leonardo
included
her
prominently."
"Hold
on,"
Sophie
said.
"You
told
me
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
woman.
The
Last
Supper
is
a
painting
of
thirteen
men."
"Is
it?"
Teabing
arched
his
eyebrows.
"Take
a
closer
look."
Uncertain,
Sophie
made
her
way
closer
to
the
painting,
scanning
the
thirteen
figures
Jesus
Christ
in
the
middle,
six
disciples
on
His
left,
and
six
on
His
right.
"They're
all
men,"
she
confirmed.
"Oh?"
Teabing
said.
"How
about
the
one
seated
in
the
place
of
honor,
at
the
right
hand
of
the
Lord?"
Sophie
examined
the
figure
to
Jesus'
immediate
right,
focusing
in.
As
she
studied
the
person's
face
and
body,
a
wave
of
astonishment
rose
within
her.
The
individual
had
flowing
red
hair,
delicate
folded
hands,
and
the
hint
of
a
bosom.
It
was,
without
a
doubt
female.
"That's
a
woman!"
Sophie
exclaimed.
Teabing
was
laughing.
"Surprise,
surprise.
Believe
me,
it's
no
mistake.
Leonardo
was
skilled
at
painting
the
difference
between
the
sexes."
Sophie
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
woman
beside
Christ.
The
Last
Supper
is
supposed
to
be
thirteen
men.
Who
is
this
woman?
Although
Sophie
had
seen
this
classic
image
many
times,
she
had
not
once
noticed
this
glaring
discrepancy.
"Everyone
misses
it,"
Teabing
said.
"Our
preconceived
notions
of
this
scene
are
so
powerful
that
our
mind
blocks
out
the
incongruity
and
overrides
our
eyes."
"It's
known
as
skitoma,
"
Langdon
added.
"The
brain
does
it
sometimes
with
powerful
symbols."
"Another
reason
you
might
have
missed
the
woman,"
Teabing
said,
"is
that
many
of
the
photographs
in
art
books
were
taken
before
1954,
when
the
details
were
still
hidden
beneath
layers
of
grime
and
several
restorative
repaintings
done
by
clumsy
hands
in
the
eighteenth
century.
Now,
at
last,
the
fresco
has
been
cleaned
down
to
Da
Vinci's
original
layer
of
paint."
He
motioned
to
the
photograph.
"Etvoilaf"
Sophie
moved
closer
to
the
image.
The
woman
to
Jesus'
right
was
young
and
pious
looking,
with
a
demure
face,
beautiful
red
hair,
and
hands
folded
quietly.
This
is
the
woman
who
singlehandedly
could
crumble
the
Church?
"Who
is
she?"
Sophie
asked.
"That,
my
dear,"
Teabing
replied,
"is
Mary
Magdalene."
Sophie
turned.
"The
prostitute?"
Teabing
drew
a
short
breath,
as
if
the
word
had
injured
him
personally.
"Magdalene
was
no
such
thing.
That
unfortunate
misconception
is
the
legacy
of
a
smear
campaign
launched
by
the
early
Church.
The
Church
needed
to
defame
Mary
Magdalene
in
order
to
cover
up
her
dangerous
secret
her
role
as
the
Holy
Grail."
"Herroe?"
"As
I
mentioned,"
Teabing
clarified,
"the
early
Church
needed
to
convince
the
world
that
the
mortal
prophet
Jesus
was
a
divine
being.
Therefore,
any
gospels
that
