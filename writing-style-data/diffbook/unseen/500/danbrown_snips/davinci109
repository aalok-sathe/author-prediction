small
television
he
was
watching
and
greeted
them
with
a
pleasant
smile.
Despite
his
enormous
muscles
and
visible
sidearm,
his
diction
chimed
with
the
polished
courtesy
of
a
Swiss
bellhop.
"Bonsoir,
"
he
said.
"How
may
I
help
you?"
The
dual
language
greeting
was
the
newest
hospitality
trick
of
the
European
host.
It
presumed
nothing
and
opened
the
door
for
the
guest
to
reply
in
whichever
language
was
more
comfortable.
Sophie
replied
with
neither.
She
simply
laid
the
gold
key
on
the
counter
in
front
of
the
man.
The
man
glanced
down
and
immediately
stood
straighter.
"Of
course.
Your
elevator
is
at
the
end
of
the
hall.
I
will
alert
someone
that
you
are
on
your
way."
Sophie
nodded
and
took
her
key
back.
"Which
floor?"
The
man
gave
her
an
odd
look.
"Your
key
instructs
the
elevator
which
floor."
She
smiled.
"Ah,
yes."
The
guard
watched
as
the
two
newcomers
made
their
way
to
the
elevators,
inserted
their
key,
boarded
the
lift,
and
disappeared.
As
soon
as
the
door
had
closed,
he
grabbed
the
phone.
He
was
not
calling
to
alert
anyone
of
their
arrival;
there
was
no
need
for
that.
A
vault
greeter
already
had
been
alerted
automatically
when
the
client's
key
was
inserted
outside
in
the
entry
gate.
Instead,
the
guard
was
calling
the
bank's
night
manager.
As
the
line
rang,
the
guard
switched
the
television
back
on
and
stared
at
it.
The
news
story
he
had
been
watching
was
just
ending.
It
didn't
matter.
He
got
another
look
at
the
two
faces
on
the
television.
The
manager
answered.
"Oui?"
"We
have
a
situation
down
here."
"What's
happening?"
the
manager
demanded.
"The
French
police
are
tracking
two
fugitives
tonight."
"So?"
"Both
of
them
just
walked
into
our
bank."
The
manager
cursed
quietly.
"Okay.
I'll
contact
Monsieur
Vernet
immediately."
The
guard
then
hung
up
and
placed
a
second
call.
This
one
to
Interpol.
Langdon
was
surprised
to
feel
the
elevator
dropping
rather
than
climbing.
He
had
no
idea
how
many
floors
they
had
descended
beneath
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
before
the
door
finally
opened.
He
didn't
care.
He
was
happy
to
be
out
of
the
elevator.
Displaying
impressive
alacrity,
a
host
was
already
standing
there
to
greet
them.
He
was
elderly
and
pleasant,
wearing
a
neatly
pressed
flannel
suit
that
made
him
look
oddly
out
of
place
an
old
world
banker
in
a
high
tech
world.
"Bonsoir,
"
the
man
said.
"Good
evening.
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
follow
me,
s'il
vous
plait?"
Without
waiting
for
a
response,
he
spun
on
his
heel
and
strode
briskly
down
a
narrow
metal
corridor.
Langdon
walked
with
Sophie
down
a
series
of
corridors,
past
several
large
rooms
filled
with
blinking
mainframe
computers.
"Void,
"
their
host
said,
arriving
at
a
steel
door
and
opening
it
for
them.
"Here
you
are."
Langdon
and
Sophie
stepped
into
another
world.
The
small
room
before
them
looked
like
a
lavish
sitting
room
at
a
fine
hotel.
Gone
were
the
metal
and
rivets,
