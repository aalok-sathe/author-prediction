on
the
floor.
I
wouldn't
have
given
it
a
second
thought
except
the
rungs
were
worn
and
muddy.
This
ladder
gets
regular
use.
The
height
of
the
hayloft
matched
the
ladder,
so
I
raised
it
and
climbed
up
to
have
a
look."
Collet's
eyes
climbed
the
ladder's
steep
incline
to
the
soaring
hayloft.
Someone
goes
up
there
regularly?
From
down
here,
the
loft
appeared
to
be
a
deserted
platform,
and
yet
admittedly
most
of
it
was
invisible
from
this
line
of
sight.
A
senior
PTS
agent
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
ladder,
looking
down.
"You'll
definitely
want
to
see
this,
Lieutenant,"
he
said,
waving
Collet
up
with
a
latex
gloved
hand.
Nodding
tiredly,
Collet
walked
over
to
the
base
of
the
old
ladder
and
grasped
the
bottom
rungs.
The
ladder
was
an
antique
tapered
design
and
narrowed
as
Collet
ascended.
As
he
neared
the
top,
Collet
almost
lost
his
footing
on
a
thin
rung.
The
barn
below
him
spun.
Alert
now,
he
moved
on,
finally
reaching
the
top.
The
agent
above
him
reached
out,
offering
his
wrist.
Collet
grabbed
it
and
made
the
awkward
transition
onto
the
platform.
"It's
over
there,"
the
PTS
agent
said,
pointing
deep
into
the
immaculately
clean
loft.
"Only
one
set
of
prints
up
here.
We'll
have
an
ID
shortly."
Collet
squinted
through
the
dim
light
toward
the
far
wall.
What
the
hell?
Nestled
against
the
far
wall
sat
an
elaborate
computer
workstation
two
tower
CPUs,
a
flat
screen
video
monitor
with
speakers,
an
array
of
hard
drives,
and
a
multichannel
audio
console
that
appeared
to
have
its
own
filtered
power
supply.
Why
in
the
world
would
anyone
work
all
the
way
up
here?
Collet
moved
toward
the
gear.
"Have
you
examined
the
system?"
"It's
a
listening
post."
Collet
spun.
"Surveillance?"
The
agent
nodded.
"Very
advanced
surveillance."
He
motioned
to
a
long
project
table
strewn
with
electronic
parts,
manuals,
tools,
wires,
soldering
irons,
and
other
electronic
components.
"Someone
clearly
knows
what
he's
doing.
A
lot
of
this
gear
is
as
sophisticated
as
our
own
equipment.
Miniature
microphones,
photoelectric
recharging
cells,
high
capacity
RAM
chips.
He's
even
got
some
of
those
new
nano
drives."
Collet
was
impressed.
"Here's
a
complete
system,"
the
agent
said,
handing
Collet
an
assembly
not
much
larger
than
a
pocket
calculator.
Dangling
off
the
contraption
was
a
foot
long
wire
with
a
stamp
sized
piece
of
wafer
thin
foil
stuck
on
the
end.
"The
base
is
a
high
capacity
hard
disk
audio
recording
system
with
rechargeable
battery.
That
strip
of
foil
at
the
end
of
the
wire
is
a
combination
microphone
and
photoelectric
recharging
cell."
Collet
knew
them
well.
These
foil
like,
photocell
microphones
had
been
an
enormous
breakthrough
a
few
years
back.
Now,
a
hard
disk
recorder
could
be
affixed
behind
a
lamp,
for
example,
with
its
foil
microphone
molded
into
the
contour
of
the
base
and
dyed
to
match.
As
long
as
the
microphone
was
positioned
such
that
it
received
a
few
hours
of
sunlight
per
day,
the
photo
cells
