the
locks
on
the
rear
doors
began
to
turn.
When
the
doors
swung
open,
Langdon
was
surprised
to
see
they
were
parked
in
a
wooded
area,
well
off
the
road.
Vernet
stepped
into
view,
a
strained
look
in
his
eye.
In
his
hand,
he
held
a
pistol.
'I'm
sorry
about
this,"
he
said.
"I
really
have
no
choice.
Andre
Vernet
looked
awkward
with
a
pistol,
but
his
eyes
shone
with
a
determination
that
Langdon
sensed
would
be
unwise
to
test.
"I'm
afraid
I
must
insist,"
Vernet
said,
training
the
weapon
on
the
two
of
them
in
the
back
of
the
idling
truck.
"Set
the
box
down."
Sophie
clutched
the
box
to
her
chest.
"You
said
you
and
my
grandfather
were
friends."
"I
have
a
duty
to
protect
your
grandfather's
assets,"
Vernet
replied.
"And
that
is
exactly
what
I
am
doing.
Now
set
the
box
on
the
floor."
"My
grandfather
entrusted
this
to
me!"
Sophie
declared.
"Do
it,"
Vernet
commanded,
raising
the
gun.
Sophie
set
the
box
at
her
feet.
Langdon
watched
the
gun
barrel
swing
now
in
his
direction.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Vernet
said,
"you
will
bring
the
box
over
to
me.
And
be
aware
that
I'm
asking
you
because
you
I
would
not
hesitate
to
shoot."
Langdon
stared
at
the
banker
in
disbelief.
"Why
are
you
doing
this?"
"Why
do
you
imagine?"
Vernet
snapped,
his
accented
English
terse
now.
"To
protect
my
client's
assets."
"We
are
your
clients
now,"
Sophie
said.
Vernet's
visage
turned
ice
cold,
an
eerie
transformation.
"Mademoiselle
Neveu,
I
don't
know
how
you
got
that
key
and
account
number
tonight,
but
it
seems
obvious
that
foul
play
was
involved.
Had
I
known
the
extent
of
your
crimes,
I
would
never
have
helped
you
leave
the
bank."
"I
told
you,"
Sophie
said,
"we
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
grandfather's
death!"
Vernet
looked
at
Langdon.
"And
yet
the
radio
claims
you
are
wanted
not
only
for
the
murder
of
Jacques
Sauniere
but
for
those
of
three
other
men
as
well?"
"What!"
Langdon
was
thunderstruck.
Three
more
murders?
The
coincidental
number
hit
him
harder
than
the
fact
that
he
was
the
prime
suspect.
It
seemed
too
unlikely
to
be
a
coincidence.
The
three
senechaux?
Langdon's
eyes
dropped
to
the
rosewood
box.
If
the
senechaux
were
murdered,
Sauniere
had
no
options.
He
had
to
transfer
the
keystone
to
someone.
"The
police
can
sort
that
out
when
I
turn
you
in,"
Vernet
said.
"I
have
gotten
my
bank
involved
too
far
already."
Sophie
glared
at
Vernet.
"You
obviously
have
no
intention
of
turning
us
in.
You
would
have
driven
us
back
to
the
bank.
And
instead
you
bring
us
out
here
and
hold
us
at
gunpoint?"
"Your
grandfather
hired
me
for
one
reason
to
keep
his
possessions
both
safe
and
private.
Whatever
this
box
contains,
I
have
no
intention
of
letting
it
become
a
piece
of
cataloged
evidence
in
a
police
investigation.
Mr.
Langdon,
bring
me
the
box.
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Don't
do
it."
A
gunshot
roared,
and
a
bullet
