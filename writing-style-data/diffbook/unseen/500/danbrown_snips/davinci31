line
is
secure,
Mr.
Langdon.
You
may
use
it."
Langdon
felt
mystified
by
Fache's
anger
with
the
young
woman.
Feeling
uneasy,
he
accepted
the
captain's
phone.
Fache
immediately
marched
Sophie
several
steps
away
and
began
chastising
her
in
hushed
tones.
Disliking
the
captain
more
and
more,
Langdon
turned
away
from
the
odd
confrontation
and
switched
on
the
cell
phone.
Checking
the
slip
of
paper
Sophie
had
given
him,
Langdon
dialed
the
number.
The
line
began
to
ring.
One
ring
two
rings
three
rings
Finally
the
call
connected.
Langdon
expected
to
hear
an
embassy
operator,
but
he
found
himself
instead
listening
to
an
answering
machine.
Oddly,
the
voice
on
the
tape
was
familiar.
It
was
that
of
Sophie
Neveu.
"Bonjour,
vous
etes
bien
chez
Sophie
Neveu,
"
the
woman's
voice
said.
"Je
suis
absenle
pour
le
moment,
mais"
Confused,
Langdon
turned
back
toward
Sophie.
"I'm
sorry,
Ms.
Neveu?
I
think
you
may
have
given
me
"No,
that's
the
right
number,"
Sophie
interjected
quickly,
as
if
anticipating
Langdon's
confusion.
"The
embassy
has
an
automated
message
system.
You
have
to
dial
an
access
code
to
pick
up
your
messages.
Langdon
stared.
"But
"It's
the
three
digit
code
on
the
paper
I
gave
you."
Langdon
opened
his
mouth
to
explain
the
bizarre
error,
but
Sophie
flashed
him
a
silencing
glare
that
lasted
only
an
instant.
Her
green
eyes
sent
a
crystal
clear
message.
Don
't
ask
questions.
Just
do
it.
Bewildered,
Langdon
punched
in
the
extension
on
the
slip
of
paper:
454.
Sophie's
outgoing
message
immediately
cut
off,
and
Langdon
heard
an
electronic
voice
announce
in
French:
"You
have
one
new
message."
Apparently,
454
was
Sophie's
remote
access
code
for
picking
up
her
messages
while
away
from
home.
I'm
picking
up
this
woman's
messages?
Langdon
could
hear
the
tape
rewinding
now.
Finally,
it
stopped,
and
the
machine
engaged.
Langdon
listened
as
the
message
began
to
play.
Again,
the
voice
on
the
line
was
Sophie's.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
the
message
began
in
a
fearful
whisper.
"Do
not
react
to
this
message.
Just
listen
calmly.
You
are
in
danger
right
now.
Follow
my
directions
very
closely."
Silas
sat
behind
the
wheel
of
the
black
Audi
the
Teacher
had
arranged
for
him
and
gazed
out
at
the
great
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice.
Lit
from
beneath
by
banks
of
floodlights,
the
church's
two
bell
towers
rose
like
stalwart
sentinels
above
the
building's
long
body.
On
either
flank,
a
shadowy
row
of
sleek
buttresses
jutted
out
like
the
ribs
of
a
beautiful
beast.
The
heathens
used
a
house
of
God
to
conceal
their
keystone.
Again
the
brotherhood
had
confirmed
their
legendary
reputation
for
illusion
and
deceit.
Silas
was
looking
forward
to
finding
the
keystone
and
giving
it
to
the
Teacher
so
they
could
recover
what
the
brotherhood
had
long
ago
stolen
from
the
faithful.
How
powerful
that
will
make
Opus
Dei.
Parking
the
Audi
on
the
deserted
Place
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
exhaled,
telling
himself
to
clear
his
mind
for
the
task
at
hand.
His
broad
back
still
ached
from
the
