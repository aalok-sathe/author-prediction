wake
up."
He
paused,
a
knot
growing
in
his
throat.
"I'm
sorry,
I'm
not
very
good
at
Sophie
reached
out
and
placed
her
soft
hand
on
the
side
of
his
face.
Then,
leaning
forward,
she
kissed
him
tenderly
on
the
cheek.
"When
can
I
see
you
again?"
Langdon
reeled
momentarily,
lost
in
her
eyes.
"When?"
He
paused,
curious
if
she
had
any
idea
how
much
he
had
been
wondering
the
same
thing.
"Well,
actually,
next
month
I'm
lecturing
at
a
conference
in
Florence.
I'll
be
there
a
week
without
much
to
do."
"Is
that
an
invitation?"
"We'd
be
living
in
luxury.
They're
giving
me
a
room
at
the
Brunelleschi.
Sophie
smiled
playfully.
"You
presume
a
lot,
Mr.
Langdon."
He
cringed
at
how
it
had
sounded.
"What
I
meant
"I
would
love
nothing
more
than
to
meet
you
in
Florence,
Robert.
But
on
one
condition."
Her
tone
turned
serious.
"No
museums,
no
churches,
no
tombs,
no
art,
no
relics."
"In
Florence?
For
a
week?
There's
nothing
else
to
do."
Sophie
leaned
forward
and
kissed
him
again,
now
on
the
lips.
Their
bodies
came
together,
softly
at
first,
and
then
completely.
When
she
pulled
away,
her
eyes
were
full
of
promise.
"Right,"
Langdon
managed.
"It's
a
date."
Epilogue
Robert
Langdon
awoke
with
a
start.
He
had
been
dreaming.
The
bathrobe
beside
his
bed
bore
the
monogram
HOTEL
RITZ
PARIS.
He
saw
a
dim
light
filtering
through
the
blinds.
Is
it
dusk
or
dawn
?
he
wondered.
Langdon's
body
felt
warm
and
deeply
contented.
He
had
slept
the
better
part
of
the
last
two
days.
Sitting
up
slowly
in
bed,
he
now
realized
what
had
awoken
him
the
strangest
thought.
For
days
he
had
been
trying
to
sort
through
a
barrage
of
information,
but
now
Langdon
found
himself
fixed
on
something
he'd
not
considered
before.
Could
it
be?
He
remained
motionless
a
long
moment.
Getting
out
of
bed,
he
walked
to
the
marble
shower.
Stepping
inside,
he
let
the
powerful
jets
message
his
shoulders.
Still,
the
thought
enthralled
him.
Impossible.
Twenty
minutes
later,
Langdon
stepped
out
of
the
Hotel
Ritz
into
Place
Vendome.
Night
was
falling.
The
days
of
sleep
had
left
him
disoriented
and
yet
his
mind
felt
oddly
lucid.
He
had
promised
himself
he
would
stop
in
the
hotel
lobby
for
a
cafe
au
lait
to
clear
his
thoughts,
but
instead
his
legs
carried
him
directly
out
the
front
door
into
the
gathering
Paris
night.
Walking
east
on
Rue
des
Petits
Champs,
Langdon
felt
a
growing
excitement.
He
turned
south
onto
Rue
Richelieu,
where
the
air
grew
sweet
with
the
scent
of
blossoming
jasmine
from
the
stately
gardens
of
the
Palais
Royal.
He
continued
south
until
he
saw
what
he
was
looking
for
the
famous
royal
arcade
a
glistening
expanse
of
polished
black
marble.
Moving
onto
it,
Langdon
scanned
the
surface
beneath
his
feet.
Within
seconds,
he
found
what
he
knew
was
there
several
bronze
medallions
embedded
in
the
ground
in
a
perfectly
straight
line.
Each
disk
was
five
inches
in
