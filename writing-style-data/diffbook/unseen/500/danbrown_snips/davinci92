lectures
to
tourists.
"Tell
me,"
Aringarosa
said
to
the
young
priest,
"when
did
the
tail
start
wagging
the
dog?"
The
priest
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"Sir?"
Aringarosa
waved
it
off,
deciding
not
to
launch
into
that
particular
offensive
again
this
evening.
The
Vatican
has
gone
mad.
Like
a
lazy
parent
who
found
it
easier
to
acquiesce
to
the
whims
of
a
spoiled
child
than
to
stand
firm
and
teach
values,
the
Church
just
kept
softening
at
every
turn,
trying
to
reinvent
itself
to
accommodate
a
culture
gone
astray.
The
top
floor's
corridor
was
wide,
lushly
appointed,
and
led
in
only
one
direction
toward
a
huge
set
of
oak
doors
with
a
brass
sign.
BIBLIOTECA
ASTRONOMICA
Aringarosa
had
heard
of
this
place
the
Vatican's
Astronomy
Library
rumored
to
contain
more
than
twenty
five
thousand
volumes,
including
rare
works
of
Copernicus,
Galileo,
Kepler,
Newton,
and
Secchi.
Allegedly,
it
was
also
the
place
in
which
the
Pope's
highest
officers
held
private
meetings
those
meetings
they
preferred
not
to
hold
within
the
walls
of
Vatican
City.
Approaching
the
door,
Bishop
Aringarosa
would
never
have
imagined
the
shocking
news
he
was
about
to
receive
inside,
or
the
deadly
chain
of
events
it
would
put
into
motion.
It
was
not
until
an
hour
later,
as
he
staggered
from
the
meeting,
that
the
devastating
implications
settled
in.
Six
months
from
now!
he
had
thought.
God
help
us!
Now,
seated
in
the
Fiat,
Bishop
Aringarosa
realized
his
fists
were
clenched
just
thinking
about
that
first
meeting.
He
released
his
grip
and
forced
a
slow
inhalation,
relaxing
his
muscles.
Everything
will
be
fine,
he
told
himself
as
the
Fiat
wound
higher
into
the
mountains.
Still,
he
wished
his
cell
phone
would
ring.
Why
hasn't
the
Teacher
called
me?
Silas
should
have
the
keystone
by
now.
Trying
to
ease
his
nerves,
the
bishop
meditated
on
the
purple
amethyst
in
his
ring.
Feeling
the
textures
of
the
mitre
crozier
applique
and
the
facets
of
the
diamonds,
he
reminded
himself
that
this
ring
was
a
symbol
of
power
far
less
than
that
which
he
would
soon
attain.
The
inside
of
Gare
Saint
Lazare
looked
like
every
other
train
station
in
Europe,
a
gaping
indoor
outdoor
cavern
dotted
with
the
usual
suspects
homeless
men
holding
cardboard
signs,
collections
of
bleary
eyed
college
kids
sleeping
on
backpacks
and
zoning
out
to
their
portable
MP3
players,
and
clusters
of
blue
clad
baggage
porters
smoking
cigarettes.
Sophie
raised
her
eyes
to
the
enormous
departure
board
overhead.
The
black
and
white
tabs
reshuffled,
ruffling
downward
as
the
information
refreshed.
When
the
update
was
finished,
Langdon
eyed
the
offerings.
The
topmost
listing
read:
LYON
RAPIDE
3:06
"I
wish
it
left
sooner,"
Sophie
said,
"but
Lyon
will
have
to
do."
Sooner?
Langdon
checked
his
watch
2:59
A.M.
The
train
left
in
seven
minutes
and
they
didn't
even
have
tickets
yet.
Sophie
guided
Langdon
toward
the
ticket
window
and
said,
"Buy
us
two
tickets
with
your
credit
card."
"I
thought
credit
card
usage
could
be
traced
by
"Exactly."
