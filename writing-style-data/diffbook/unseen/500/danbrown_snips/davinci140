that
explains
it."
Teabing
hobbled
lower
through
the
shadows.
"Perhaps
Robert
told
you
I
schooled
just
down
the
road
at
Oxford."
Teabing
fixed
Langdon
with
a
devilish
smile.
"Of
course,
I
also
applied
to
Harvard
as
my
safety
school."
Their
host
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
appearing
to
Sophie
no
more
like
a
knight
than
Sir
Elton
John.
Portly
and
ruby
faced,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
bushy
red
hair
and
jovial
hazel
eyes
that
seemed
to
twinkle
as
he
spoke.
He
wore
pleated
pants
and
a
roomy
silk
shirt
under
a
paisley
vest.
Despite
the
aluminum
braces
on
his
legs,
he
carried
himself
with
a
resilient,
vertical
dignity
that
seemed
more
a
by
product
of
noble
ancestry
than
any
kind
of
conscious
effort.
Teabing
arrived
and
extended
a
hand
to
Langdon.
"Robert,
you've
lost
weight."
Langdon
grinned.
"And
you've
found
some."
Teabing
laughed
heartily,
patting
his
rotund
belly.
"Touche.
My
only
carnal
pleasures
these
days
seem
to
be
culinary.
"
Turning
now
to
Sophie,
he
gently
took
her
hand,
bowing
his
head
slightly,
breathing
lightly
on
her
fingers,
and
diverting
his
eyes.
"M'lady."
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
uncertain
whether
she'd
stepped
back
in
time
or
into
a
nuthouse.
The
butler
who
had
answered
the
door
now
entered
carrying
a
tea
service,
which
he
arranged
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
fireplace.
"This
is
Remy
Legaludec,"
Teabing
said,
"my
manservant."
The
slender
butler
gave
a
stiff
nod
and
disappeared
yet
again.
"Remy
is
Lyonais,
"
Teabing
whispered,
as
if
it
were
an
unfortunate
disease.
"But
he
does
sauces
quite
nicely."
Langdon
looked
amused.
"I
would
have
thought
you'd
import
an
English
staff?"
"Good
heavens,
no!
I
would
not
wish
a
British
chef
on
anyone
except
the
French
tax
collectors."
He
glanced
over
at
Sophie.
"Pardonnez
moi,
Mademoiselle
Neveu.
Please
be
assured
that
my
distaste
for
the
French
extends
only
to
politics
and
the
soccer
pitch.
Your
government
steals
my
money,
and
your
football
squad
recently
humiliated
us."
Sophie
offered
an
easy
smile.
Teabing
eyed
her
a
moment
and
then
looked
at
Langdon.
"Something
has
happened.
You
both
look
shaken.
Langdon
nodded.
"We've
had
an
interesting
night,
Leigh."
"No
doubt.
You
arrive
on
my
doorstep
unannounced
in
the
middle
of
the
night
speaking
of
the
Grail.
Tell
me,
is
this
indeed
about
the
Grail,
or
did
you
simply
say
that
because
you
know
it
is
the
lone
topic
for
which
I
would
rouse
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
night?"
A
little
of
both,
Sophie
thought,
picturing
the
cryptex
hidden
beneath
the
couch.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"we'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
Priory
of
Sion."
Teabing's
bushy
eyebrows
arched
with
intrigue.
"The
keepers.
So
this
is
indeed
about
the
Grail.
You
say
you
come
with
information?
Something
new,
Robert?"
"Perhaps.
We're
not
quite
sure.
We
might
have
a
better
idea
if
we
could
get
some
information
from
you
first."
Teabing
wagged
his
finger.
"Ever
the
wily
American.
A
game
of
quid
pro
quo.
Very
well.
I
am
