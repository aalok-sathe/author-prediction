Carrousel!
Outside
the
bathroom
window!
And
it's
not
moving
at
all!
Jesus,
I
think
Langdon
has
just
committed
suicide!"
Fache
heard
the
words,
but
they
made
no
sense.
He
kept
running.
The
hallway
seemed
never
ending.
As
he
sprinted
past
Sauniere's
body,
he
set
his
sights
on
the
partitions
at
the
far
end
of
the
Denon
Wing.
The
alarm
was
getting
louder
now.
"Wait!"
Collet's
voice
blared
again
over
the
radio.
"He's
moving!
My
God,
he's
alive.
Langdon's
moving
!
Fache
kept
running,
cursing
the
length
of
the
hallway
with
every
step.
"Langdon's
moving
faster!"
Collet
was
still
yelling
on
the
radio.
"He's
running
down
Carrousel.
Wait
he's
picking
up
speed.
He's
moving
too
fast!"
Arriving
at
the
partitions,
Fache
snaked
his
way
through
them,
saw
the
rest
room
door,
and
ran
for
it.
The
walkie
talkie
was
barely
audible
now
over
the
alarm.
"He
must
be
in
a
car!
I
think
he's
in
a
car!
I
can't
Collet's
words
were
swallowed
by
the
alarm
as
Fache
finally
burst
into
the
men's
room
with
his
gun
drawn.
Wincing
against
the
piercing
shrill,
he
scanned
the
area.
The
stalls
were
empty.
The
bathroom
deserted.
Fache's
eyes
moved
immediately
to
the
shattered
window
at
the
far
end
of
the
room.
He
ran
to
the
opening
and
looked
over
the
edge.
Langdon
was
nowhere
to
be
seen.
Fache
could
not
imagine
anyone
risking
a
stunt
like
this.
Certainly
if
he
had
dropped
that
far,
he
would
be
badly
injured.
The
alarm
cut
off
finally,
and
Collet's
voice
became
audible
again
over
the
walkie
talkie.
"moving
south
faster
crossing
the
Seine
on
Pont
du
Carrousel!"
Fache
turned
to
his
left.
The
only
vehicle
on
Pont
du
Carrousel
was
an
enormous
twin
bed
Trailor
delivery
truck
moving
southward
away
from
the
Louvre.
The
truck's
open
air
bed
was
covered
with
a
vinyl
tarp,
roughly
resembling
a
giant
hammock.
Fache
felt
a
shiver
of
apprehension.
That
truck,
only
moments
ago,
had
probably
been
stopped
at
a
red
light
directly
beneath
the
rest
room
window.
An
insane
risk,
Fache
told
himself.
Langdon
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
truck
was
carrying
beneath
that
tarp.
What
if
the
truck
were
carrying
steel?
Or
cement?
Or
even
garbage?
A
forty
foot
leap?
It
was
madness.
"The
dot
is
turning!"
Collet
called.
"He's
turning
right
on
Pont
des
Saints
Peres!"
Sure
enough,
the
Trailor
truck
that
had
crossed
the
bridge
was
slowing
down
and
making
a
right
turn
onto
Pont
des
Saints
Peres.
So
be
it,
Fache
thought.
Amazed,
he
watched
the
truck
disappear
around
the
corner.
Collet
was
already
radioing
the
agents
outside,
pulling
them
off
the
Louvre
perimeter
and
sending
them
to
their
patrol
cars
in
pursuit,
all
the
while
broadcasting
the
truck's
changing
location
like
some
kind
of
bizarre
play
by
play.
It's
over,
Fache
knew.
His
men
would
have
the
truck
surrounded
within
minutes.
Langdon
was
not
going
anywhere.
Stowing
his
weapon,
Fache
exited
the
rest
room
and
radioed
Collet.
"Bring
my
car
around.
I
