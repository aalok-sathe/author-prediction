in
a
well
lit
abbey
had
been
formed
during
the
peak
summer
tourist
season.
Today
was
a
rainy
April
morning.
Rather
than
crowds
and
shimmering
stained
glass,
all
Langdon
saw
was
acres
of
desolate
floor
and
shadowy,
empty
alcoves.
"We
passed
through
metal
detectors,"
Sophie
reminded,
apparently
sensing
Langdon's
apprehension.
"If
anyone
is
in
here,
they
can't
be
armed."
Langdon
nodded
but
still
felt
circumspect.
He
had
wanted
to
bring
the
London
police
with
them,
but
Sophie's
fears
of
who
might
be
involved
put
a
damper
on
any
contact
with
the
authorities.
We
need
to
recover
the
cryptex,
Sophie
had
insisted.
It
is
the
key
to
everything.
She
was
right,
of
course.
The
key
to
getting
Leigh
back
alive.
The
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail.
The
key
to
learning
who
is
behind
this.
Unfortunately,
their
only
chance
to
recover
the
keystone
seemed
to
be
here
and
now
at
the
tomb
of
Isaac
Newton.
Whoever
held
the
cryptex
would
have
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
tomb
to
decipher
the
final
clue,
and
if
they
had
not
already
come
and
gone,
Sophie
and
Langdon
intended
to
intercept
them.
Striding
toward
the
left
wall
to
get
out
of
the
open,
they
moved
into
an
obscure
side
aisle
behind
a
row
of
pilasters.
Langdon
couldn't
shake
the
image
of
Leigh
Teabing
being
held
captive,
probably
tied
up
in
the
back
of
his
own
limousine.
Whoever
had
ordered
the
top
Priory
members
killed
would
not
hesitate
to
eliminate
others
who
stood
in
the
way.
It
seemed
a
cruel
irony
that
Teabing
a
modern
British
knight
was
a
hostage
in
the
search
for
his
own
countryman,
Sir
Isaac
Newton.
"Which
way
is
it?"
Sophie
asked,
looking
around.
The
tomb.
Langdon
had
no
idea.
"We
should
find
a
docent
and
ask."
Langdon
knew
better
than
to
wander
aimlessly
in
here.
Westminster
Abbey
was
a
tangled
warren
of
mausoleums,
perimeter
chambers,
and
walk
in
burial
niches.
Like
the
Louvre's
Grand
Gallery,
it
had
a
lone
point
of
entry
the
door
through
which
they
had
just
passed
easy
to
find
your
way
in,
but
impossible
to
find
your
way
out.
A
literal
tourist
trap,
one
of
Langdon's
befuddled
colleagues
had
called
it.
Keeping
architectural
tradition,
the
abbey
was
laid
out
in
the
shape
of
a
giant
crucifix.
Unlike
most
churches,
however,
it
had
its
entrance
on
the
side,
rather
than
the
standard
rear
of
the
church
via
the
narthex
at
the
bottom
of
the
nave.
Moreover,
the
abbey
had
a
series
of
sprawling
cloisters
attached.
One
false
step
through
the
wrong
archway,
and
a
visitor
was
lost
in
a
labyrinth
of
outdoor
passageways
surrounded
by
high
walls.
"Docents
wear
crimson
robes,"
Langdon
said,
approaching
the
center
of
the
church.
Peering
obliquely
across
the
towering
gilded
altar
to
the
far
end
of
the
south
transept,
Langdon
saw
several
people
crawling
on
their
hands
and
knees.
This
prostrate
pilgrimage
was
a
common
occurrence
in
Poets'
Corner,
although
it
was
far
less
holy
than
it
appeared.
Tourists
doing
grave
rubbings.
