soon
as
he's
free."
Collet
took
down
the
address
and
jumped
in
his
car.
As
he
peeled
away
from
the
bank,
Collet
realized
he
had
forgotten
to
ask
who
had
tipped
DCPJ
off
to
Langdon's
location.
Not
that
it
mattered.
Collet
had
been
blessed
with
a
chance
to
redeem
his
skepticism
and
earlier
blunders.
He
was
about
to
make
the
most
high
profile
arrest
of
his
career.
Collet
radioed
the
five
cars
accompanying
him.
"No
sirens,
men.
Langdon
can't
know
we're
coming."
Forty
kilometers
away,
a
black
Audi
pulled
off
a
rural
road
and
parked
in
the
shadows
on
the
edge
of
a
field.
Silas
got
out
and
peered
through
the
rungs
of
the
wrought
iron
fence
that
encircled
the
vast
compound
before
him.
He
gazed
up
the
long
moonlit
slope
to
the
chateau
in
the
distance.
The
downstairs
lights
were
all
ablaze.
Odd
for
this
hour,
Silas
thought,
smiling.
The
information
the
Teacher
had
given
him
was
obviously
accurate.
will
not
leave
this
house
without
the
keystone,
he
vowed.
will
not
fail
the
bishop
and
the
Teacher.
Checking
the
thirteen
round
clip
in
his
Heckler
Koch,
Silas
pushed
it
through
the
bars
and
let
it
fall
onto
the
mossy
ground
inside
the
compound.
Then,
gripping
the
top
of
the
fence,
he
heaved
himself
up
and
over,
dropping
to
the
ground
on
the
other
side.
Ignoring
the
slash
of
pain
from
his
cilice,
Silas
retrieved
his
gun
and
began
the
long
trek
up
the
grassy
slope.
Teabing's
"study"
was
like
no
study
Sophie
had
ever
seen.
Six
or
seven
times
larger
than
even
the
most
luxurious
of
office
spaces,
the
knight's
cabinet
de
travail
resembled
an
ungainly
hybrid
of
science
laboratory,
archival
library,
and
indoor
flea
market.
Lit
by
three
overhead
chandeliers,
the
boundless
tile
floor
was
dotted
with
clustered
islands
of
worktables
buried
beneath
books,
artwork,
artifacts,
and
a
surprising
amount
of
electronic
gear
computers,
projectors,
microscopes,
copy
machines,
and
flatbed
scanners.
"I
converted
the
ballroom,"
Teabing
said,
looking
sheepish
as
he
shuffled
into
the
room.
"I
have
little
occasion
to
dance.
Sophie
felt
as
if
the
entire
night
had
become
some
kind
of
twilight
zone
where
nothing
was
as
she
expected.
"This
is
all
for
your
work?"
"Learning
the
truth
has
become
my
life's
love,"
Teabing
said.
"And
the
Sangreal
is
my
favorite
mistress."
The
Holy
Grail
is
a
woman,
Sophie
thought,
her
mind
a
collage
of
interrelated
ideas
that
seemed
to
make
no
sense.
"You
said
you
have
a
picture
of
this
woman
who
you
claim
is
the
Holy
Grail."
"Yes,
but
it
is
not
I
who
claim
she
is
the
Grail.
Christ
Himself
made
that
claim."
"Which
one
is
the
painting?"
Sophie
asked,
scanning
the
walls.
"Hmmm"
Teabing
made
a
show
of
seeming
to
have
forgotten.
"The
Holy
Grail.
The
Sangreal.
The
Chalice."
He
wheeled
suddenly
and
pointed
to
the
far
wall.
On
it
hung
an
eight
foot
long
print
of
The
Last
Supper,
the
same
exact
image
Sophie
had
just
been
looking
at.
"There
