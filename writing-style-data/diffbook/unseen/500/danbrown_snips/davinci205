men
raced
over,
guns
leveled,
and
physically
blocked
Teabing
and
his
servant
from
reaching
the
limousine.
Now
Teabing
turned.
"Inspector,
this
is
your
last
warning.
Do
not
even
think
of
boarding
that
plane.
You
will
regret
it."
Ignoring
the
threat,
the
chief
inspector
gripped
his
sidearm
and
marched
up
the
plane's
gangway.
Arriving
at
the
hatch,
he
peered
inside.
After
a
moment,
he
stepped
into
the
cabin.
What
the
devil?
With
the
exception
of
the
frightened
looking
pilot
in
the
cockpit,
the
aircraft
was
empty.
Entirely
devoid
of
human
life.
Quickly
checking
the
bathroom,
the
chairs,
and
the
luggage
areas,
the
inspector
found
no
traces
of
anyone
hiding
much
less
multiple
individuals.
What
the
hell
was
Bezu
Fache
thinking?
It
seemed
Leigh
Teabing
had
been
telling
the
truth.
The
Kent
chief
inspector
stood
alone
in
the
deserted
cabin
and
swallowed
hard.
Shit.
His
face
flushed,
he
stepped
back
onto
the
gangway,
gazing
across
the
hangar
at
Leigh
Teabing
and
his
servant,
who
were
now
under
gunpoint
near
the
limousine.
"Let
them
go,"
the
inspector
ordered.
"We
received
a
bad
tip."
Teabing's
eyes
were
menacing
even
across
the
hangar.
"You
can
expect
a
call
from
my
lawyers.
And
for
future
reference,
the
French
police
cannot
be
trusted.
With
that,
Teabing's
manservant
opened
the
door
at
the
rear
of
the
stretch
limousine
and
helped
his
crippled
master
into
the
back
seat.
Then
the
servant
walked
the
length
of
the
car,
climbed
in
behind
the
wheel,
and
gunned
the
engine.
Policemen
scattered
as
the
Jaguar
peeled
out
of
the
hangar.
"Well
played,
my
good
man,"
Teabing
chimed
from
the
rear
seat
as
the
limousine
accelerated
out
of
the
airport.
He
turned
his
eyes
now
to
the
dimly
lit
front
recesses
of
the
spacious
interior.
"Everyone
comfy?"
Langdon
gave
a
weak
nod.
He
and
Sophie
were
still
crouched
on
the
floor
beside
the
bound
and
gagged
albino.
Moments
earlier,
as
the
Hawker
taxied
into
the
deserted
hangar,
Remy
had
popped
the
hatch
as
the
plane
jolted
to
a
stop
halfway
through
its
turn.
With
the
police
closing
in
fast,
Langdon
and
Sophie
dragged
the
monk
down
the
gangway
to
ground
level
and
out
of
sight
behind
the
limousine.
Then
the
jet
engines
had
roared
again,
rotating
the
plane
and
completing
its
turn
as
the
police
cars
came
skidding
into
the
hangar.
Now,
as
the
limousine
raced
toward
Kent,
Langdon
and
Sophie
clambered
toward
the
rear
of
the
limo's
long
interior,
leaving
the
monk
bound
on
the
floor.
They
settled
onto
the
long
seat
facing
Teabing.
The
Brit
gave
them
both
a
roguish
smile
and
opened
the
cabinet
on
the
limo's
bar.
"Could
I
offer
you
a
drink?
Some
nibblies?
Crisps?
Nuts?
Seltzer?"
Sophie
and
Langdon
both
shook
their
heads.
Teabing
grinned
and
closed
the
bar.
"So
then,
about
this
knight's
tomb"
"Fleet
Street?"
Langdon
asked,
eyeing
Teabing
in
the
back
of
the
limo.
There's
a
crypt
on
Fleet
Street?
So
far,
Leigh
was
being
playfully
cagey
about
where
he
thought
they
would
find
the
