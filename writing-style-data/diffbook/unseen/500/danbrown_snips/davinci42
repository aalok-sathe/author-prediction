That
message
on
the
floor
was
meant
for
me."
Langdon
needed
a
minute
to
process
that
one.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"That
message
wasn't
for
the
police.
He
wrote
it
for
me.
I
think
he
was
forced
to
do
everything
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
just
didn't
realize
how
it
would
look
to
the
police."
She
paused.
"The
numbered
code
is
meaningless.
Sauniere
wrote
it
to
make
sure
the
investigation
included
cryptographers,
ensuring
that
would
know
as
soon
as
possible
what
had
happened
to
him."
Langdon
felt
himself
losing
touch
fast.
Whether
or
not
Sophie
Neveu
had
lost
her
mind
was
at
this
point
up
for
grabs,
but
at
least
Langdon
now
understood
why
she
was
trying
to
help
him.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
She
apparently
believed
the
curator
had
left
her
a
cryptic
postscript
telling
her
to
find
Langdon.
"But
why
do
you
think
his
message
was
for
you?"
"The
Vitruvian
Man,
"
she
said
flatly.
"That
particular
sketch
has
always
been
my
favorite
Da
Vinci
work.
Tonight
he
used
it
to
catch
my
attention."
"Hold
on.
You're
saying
the
curator
knew
your
favorite
piece
of
art?"
She
nodded.
"I'm
sorry.
This
is
all
coming
out
of
order.
Jacques
Sauniere
and
I"
Sophie's
voice
caught,
and
Langdon
heard
a
sudden
melancholy
there,
a
painful
past,
simmering
just
below
the
surface.
Sophie
and
Jacques
Sauniere
apparently
had
some
kind
of
special
relationship.
Langdon
studied
the
beautiful
young
woman
before
him,
well
aware
that
aging
men
in
France
often
took
young
mistresses.
Even
so,
Sophie
Neveu
as
a
"kept
woman"
somehow
didn't
seem
to
fit.
"We
had
a
falling
out
ten
years
ago,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
a
whisper
now.
"We've
barely
spoken
since.
Tonight,
when
Crypto
got
the
call
that
he
had
been
murdered,
and
I
saw
the
images
of
his
body
and
text
on
the
floor,
I
realized
he
was
trying
to
send
me
a
message."
"Because
of
The
Vitruvian
Man?"
"Yes.
And
the
letters
P.S."
"PostScript?"
She
shook
her
head.
"P.S.
are
my
initials."
"But
your
name
is
Sophie
Neveu."
She
looked
away.
"P.S.
is
the
nickname
he
called
me
when
I
lived
with
him."
She
blushed.
"It
stood
for
Princesse
Sophie
Langdon
had
no
response.
"Silly,
I
know,"
she
said.
"But
it
was
years
ago.
When
I
was
a
little
girl."
"You
knew
him
when
you
were
a
little
girl?"
"Quite
well,"
she
said,
her
eyes
welling
now
with
emotion.
"Jacques
Sauniere
was
my
grandfather."
"Where's
Langdon?"
Fache
demanded,
exhaling
the
last
of
a
cigarette
as
he
paced
back
into
the
command
post.
"Still
in
the
men's
room,
sir."
Lieutenant
Collet
had
been
expecting
the
question.
Fache
grumbled,
"Taking
his
time,
I
see."
The
captain
eyed
the
GPS
dot
over
Collet's
shoulder,
and
Collet
could
almost
hear
the
wheels
turning.
Fache
was
fighting
the
urge
to
go
check
on
Langdon.
Ideally,
the
subject
of
an
observation
was
allowed
the
most
time
and
freedom
possible,
lulling
him
into
a
false
sense
of
security.
Langdon
needed
to
return
