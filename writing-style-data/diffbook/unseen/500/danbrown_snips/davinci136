itself,
Teabing
had
not
only
posted
his
signs
in
English,
but
he
had
installed
his
gate's
intercom
entry
system
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
truck
the
passenger's
side
everywhere
in
Europe
except
England.
Sophie
gave
the
misplaced
intercom
an
odd
look.
"And
if
someone
arrives
without
a
passenger?"
"Don't
ask."
Langdon
had
already
been
through
that
with
Teabing.
"He
prefers
things
the
way
they
are
at
home."
Sophie
rolled
down
her
window.
"Robert,
you'd
better
do
the
talking."
Langdon
shifted
his
position,
leaning
out
across
Sophie
to
press
the
intercom
button.
As
he
did,
an
alluring
whiff
of
Sophie's
perfume
filled
his
nostrils,
and
he
realized
how
close
they
were.
He
waited
there,
awkwardly
prone,
while
a
telephone
began
ringing
over
the
small
speaker.
Finally,
the
intercom
crackled
and
an
irritated
French
accent
spoke.
"Chateau
Villette.
Who
is
calling?"
"This
is
Robert
Langdon,"
Langdon
called
out,
sprawled
across
Sophie's
lap.
"I'm
a
friend
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
I
need
his
help."
"My
master
is
sleeping.
As
was
I.
What
is
your
business
with
him?"
"It
is
a
private
matter.
One
of
great
interest
to
him."
"Then
I'm
sure
he
will
be
pleased
to
receive
you
in
the
morning."
Langdon
shifted
his
weight.
"It's
quite
important."
"As
is
Sir
Leigh's
sleep.
If
you
are
a
friend,
then
you
are
aware
he
is
in
poor
health."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
suffered
from
polio
as
a
child
and
now
wore
leg
braces
and
walked
with
crutches,
but
Langdon
had
found
him
such
a
lively
and
colorful
man
on
his
last
visit
that
it
hardly
seemed
an
infirmity.
"If
you
would,
please
tell
him
I
have
uncovered
new
information
about
the
Grail.
Information
that
cannot
wait
until
morning."
There
was
a
long
pause.
Langdon
and
Sophie
waited,
the
truck
idling
loudly.
A
full
minute
passed.
Finally,
someone
spoke.
"My
good
man,
I
daresay
you
are
still
on
Harvard
Standard
Time."
The
voice
was
crisp
and
light.
Langdon
grinned,
recognizing
the
thick
British
accent.
"Leigh,
my
apologies
for
waking
you
at
this
obscene
hour."
"My
manservant
tells
me
that
not
only
are
you
in
Paris,
but
you
speak
of
the
Grail."
"I
thought
that
might
get
you
out
of
bed."
"And
so
it
has."
"Any
chance
you'd
open
the
gate
for
an
old
friend?"
"Those
who
seek
the
truth
are
more
than
friends.
They
are
brothers."
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes
at
Sophie,
well
accustomed
to
Teabing's
predilection
for
dramatic
antics.
"Indeed
I
will
open
the
gate,"
Teabing
proclaimed,
"but
first
I
must
confirm
your
heart
is
true.
A
test
of
your
honor.
You
will
answer
three
questions."
Langdon
groaned,
whispering
at
Sophie.
"Bear
with
me
here.
As
I
mentioned,
he's
something
of
a
character."
"Your
first
question,"
Teabing
declared,
his
tone
Herculean.
"Shall
I
serve
you
coffee,
or
tea?"
Langdon
knew
Teabing's
feelings
about
the
American
phenomenon
of
coffee.
"Tea,"
he
replied.
"Earl
Grey."
"Excellent.
Your
second
question.
Milk
or
sugar?"
Langdon
hesitated.
"Milk,
"
Sophie
whispered
in
his
ear.
"I
think
the
