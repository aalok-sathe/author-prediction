of
secrets
a
man
like
Jacques
Sauniere
might
keep.
What
an
ancient
brotherhood
was
doing
with
a
futuristic
key,
Langdon
had
no
idea.
The
Priory
existed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
protecting
a
secret.
A
secret
of
incredible
power.
Could
this
key
have
something
to
do
with
it?
The
thought
was
overwhelming.
"Do
you
know
what
it
opens?"
Sophie
looked
disappointed.
"I
was
hoping
you
knew."
Langdon
remained
silent
as
he
turned
the
cruciform
in
his
hand,
examining
it.
"It
looks
Christian,"
Sophie
pressed.
Langdon
was
not
so
sure
about
that.
The
head
of
this
key
was
not
the
traditional
long
stemmed
Christian
cross
but
rather
was
a
square
cross
with
four
arms
of
equal
length
which
predated
Christianity
by
fifteen
hundred
years.
This
kind
of
cross
carried
none
of
the
Christian
connotations
of
crucifixion
associated
with
the
longerstemmed
Latin
Cross,
originated
by
Romans
as
a
torture
device.
Langdon
was
always
surprised
how
few
Christians
who
gazed
upon
"the
crucifix"
realized
their
symbol's
violent
history
was
reflected
in
its
very
name:
"cross"
and
"crucifix"
came
from
the
Latin
verb
cruciare
to
torture.
"Sophie,"
he
said,
"all
I
can
tell
you
is
that
equal
armed
crosses
like
this
one
are
considered
peaceful
crosses.
Their
square
configurations
make
them
impractical
for
use
in
crucifixion,
and
their
balanced
vertical
and
horizontal
elements
convey
a
natural
union
of
male
and
female,
making
them
symbolically
consistent
with
Priory
philosophy.
She
gave
him
a
weary
look.
"You
have
no
idea,
do
you?"
Langdon
frowned.
"Not
a
clue."
"Okay,
we
have
to
get
off
the
road."
Sophie
checked
her
rearview
mirror.
"We
need
a
safe
place
to
figure
out
what
that
key
opens."
Langdon
thought
longingly
of
his
comfortable
room
at
the
Ritz.
Obviously,
that
was
not
an
option.
"How
about
my
hosts
at
the
American
University
of
Paris?"
"Too
obvious.
Fache
will
check
with
them."
"You
must
know
people.
You
live
here."
"Fache
will
run
my
phone
and
e
mail
records,
talk
to
my
coworkers.
My
contacts
are
compromised,
and
finding
a
hotel
is
no
good
because
they
all
require
identification.
Langdon
wondered
again
if
he
might
have
been
better
off
taking
his
chances
letting
Fache
arrest
him
at
the
Louvre.
"Let's
call
the
embassy.
I
can
explain
the
situation
and
have
the
embassy
send
someone
to
meet
us
somewhere."
"Meet
us?"
Sophie
turned
and
stared
at
him
as
if
he
were
crazy.
"Robert,
you're
dreaming.
Your
embassy
has
no
jurisdiction
except
on
their
own
property.
Sending
someone
to
retrieve
us
would
be
considered
aiding
a
fugitive
of
the
French
government.
It
won't
happen.
If
you
walk
into
your
embassy
and
request
temporary
asylum,
that's
one
thing,
but
asking
them
to
take
action
against
French
law
enforcement
in
the
field?"
She
shook
her
head.
"Call
your
embassy
right
now,
and
they
are
going
to
tell
you
to
avoid
further
damage
and
turn
yourself
over
to
Fache.
Then
they'll
promise
to
pursue
diplomatic
channels
to
get
you
a
fair
trial.
"
She
gazed
up
the
line
of
