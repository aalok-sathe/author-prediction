to
organize
their
Olympiads.
Nowadays,
few
people
realized
that
the
four
year
schedule
of
modern
Olympic
Games
still
followed
the
cycles
of
Venus.
Even
fewer
people
knew
that
the
five
pointed
star
had
almost
become
the
official
Olympic
seal
but
was
modified
at
the
last
moment
its
five
points
exchanged
for
five
intersecting
rings
to
better
reflect
the
games'
spirit
of
inclusion
and
harmony.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said
abruptly.
"Obviously,
the
pentacle
must
also
relate
to
the
devil.
Your
American
horror
movies
make
that
point
clearly."
Langdon
frowned.
Thank
you,
Hollywood.
The
five
pointed
star
was
now
a
virtual
cliche
in
Satanic
serial
killer
movies,
usually
scrawled
on
the
wall
of
some
Satanist's
apartment
along
with
other
alleged
demonic
symbology.
Langdon
was
always
frustrated
when
he
saw
the
symbol
in
this
context;
the
pentacle's
true
origins
were
actually
quite
godly.
"I
assure
you,"
Langdon
said,
"despite
what
you
see
in
the
movies,
the
pentacle's
demonic
interpretation
is
historically
inaccurate.
The
original
feminine
meaning
is
correct,
but
the
symbolism
of
the
pentacle
has
been
distorted
over
the
millennia.
In
this
case,
through
bloodshed."
"I'm
not
sure
I
follow."
Langdon
glanced
at
Fache's
crucifix,
uncertain
how
to
phrase
his
next
point.
"The
Church,
sir.
Symbols
are
very
resilient,
but
the
pentacle
was
altered
by
the
early
Roman
Catholic
Church.
As
part
of
the
Vatican's
campaign
to
eradicate
pagan
religions
and
convert
the
masses
to
Christianity,
the
Church
launched
a
smear
campaign
against
the
pagan
gods
and
goddesses,
recasting
their
divine
symbols
as
evil.
"Goon."
"This
is
very
common
in
times
of
turmoil,"
Langdon
continued.
"A
newly
emerging
power
will
take
over
the
existing
symbols
and
degrade
them
over
time
in
an
attempt
to
erase
their
meaning.
In
the
battle
between
the
pagan
symbols
and
Christian
symbols,
the
pagans
lost;
Poseidon's
trident
became
the
devil's
pitchfork,
the
wise
crone's
pointed
hat
became
the
symbol
of
a
witch,
and
Venus's
pentacle
became
a
sign
of
the
devil."
Langdon
paused.
"Unfortunately,
the
United
States
military
has
also
perverted
the
pentacle;
it's
now
our
foremost
symbol
of
war.
We
paint
it
on
all
our
fighter
jets
and
hang
it
on
the
shoulders
of
all
our
generals."
So
much
for
the
goddess
of
love
and
beauty.
"Interesting."
Fache
nodded
toward
the
spread
eagle
corpse.
"And
the
positioning
of
the
body?
What
do
you
make
of
that?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"The
position
simply
reinforces
the
reference
to
the
pentacle
and
sacred
feminine."
Fache's
expression
clouded.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"Replication.
Repeating
a
symbol
is
the
simplest
way
to
strengthen
its
meaning.
Jacques
Sauniere
positioned
himself
in
the
shape
of
a
five
pointed
star."
If
one
pentacle
is
good,
two
is
better.
Fache's
eyes
followed
the
five
points
of
Sauniere's
arms,
legs,
and
head
as
he
again
ran
a
hand
across
his
slick
hair.
"Interesting
analysis."
He
paused.
"And
the
nudity?"
He
grumbled
as
he
spoke
the
word,
sounding
repulsed
by
the
sight
of
an
aging
male
body.
"Why
did
he
remove
his
clothing?"
Damned
good
question,
Langdon
thought.
He'd
