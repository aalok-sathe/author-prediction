and
the
French
prison
system.
Grouard
yanked
his
walkie
talkie
off
his
belt
and
attempted
to
radio
for
backup.
All
he
heard
was
static.
The
additional
electronic
security
in
this
chamber
always
wrought
havoc
with
the
guards'
communications.

doorway.
Still
aiming
his
weapon
at
Langdon,
Grouard
began
backing
slowly
toward
the
entrance.
On
his
third
step,
he
spied
something
that
made
him
stop
short.
What
the
hell
is
that!
An
inexplicable
mirage
was
materializing
near
the
center
of
the
room.
A
silhouette.
There
was
someone
else
in
the
room?
A
woman
was
moving
through
the
darkness,
walking
briskly
toward
the
far
left
wall.
In
front
of
her,
a
purplish
beam
of
light
swung
back
and
forth
across
the
floor,
as
if
she
were
searching
for
something
with
a
colored
flashlight.
"Qui
est
la
?
"
Grouard
demanded,
feeling
his
adrenaline
spike
for
a
second
time
in
the
last
thirty
seconds.
He
suddenly
didn't
know
where
to
aim
his
gun
or
what
direction
to
move.
"PTS,"
the
woman
replied
calmly,
still
scanning
the
floor
with
her
light.

et
Scientifique.
Grouard
was
sweating
now.
thought
all
the
agents
were
gone!
He
now
recognized
the
purple
light
as
ultraviolet,
consistent
with
a
PTS
team,
and
yet
he
could
not
understand
why
DCPJ
would
be
looking
for
evidence
in
here.
"Votre
nom!"
Grouard
yelled,
instinct
telling
him
something
was
amiss.
"Repondez!"
"C'est
mot,"
the
voice
responded
in
calm
French.
"Sophie
Neveu.
Somewhere
in
the
distant
recesses
of
Grouard's
mind,
the
name
registered.
Sophie
Neveu?
That
was
the
name
of
Sauniere's
granddaughter,
wasn't
it?
She
used
to
come
in
here
as
a
little
kid,
but
that
was
years
ago.
This
couldn't
possibly
be
her!
And
even
if
it
were
Sophie
Neveu,
that
was
hardly
a
reason
to
trust
her;
Grouard
had
heard
the
rumors
of
the
painful
falling
out
between
Sauniere
and
his
granddaughter.
"You
know
me,"
the
woman
called.
"And
Robert
Langdon
did
not
kill
my
grandfather.
Believe
me."
Warden
Grouard
was
not
about
to
take
that
on
faith.

backup!
Trying
his
walkie
talkie
again,
he
got
only
static.
The
entrance
was
still
a
good
twenty
yards
behind
him,
and
Grouard
began
backing
up
slowly,
choosing
to
leave
his
gun
trained
on
the
man
on
the
floor.
As
Grouard
inched
backward,
he
could
see
the
woman
across
the
room
raising
her
UV
light
and
scrutinizing
a
large
painting
that
hung
on
the
far
side
of
the
Salle
des
Etats,
directly
opposite
the
Mona
Lisa.
Grouard
gasped,
realizing
which
painting
it
was.
What
in
the
name
of
God
is
she
doing?
Across
the
room,
Sophie
Neveu
felt
a
cold
sweat
breaking
across
her
forehead.
Langdon
was
still
spread
eagle
on
the
floor.
Hold
on,
Robert.
Almost
there.
Knowing
the
guard
would
never
actually
shoot
either
of
them,
Sophie
now
turned
her
attention
back
to
the
matter
at
hand,
scanning
the
entire
area
around
one
masterpiece
in
particular
another
Da
Vinci.
But
the
UV
light
revealed
nothing
out
