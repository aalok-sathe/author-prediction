left,
across
the
Seine,
the
illuminated
Eiffel
Tower.
Straight
ahead,
the
Arc
de
Triomphe.
And
to
the
right,
high
atop
the
sloping
rise
of
Montmartre,
the
graceful
arabesque
dome
of
Sacre
Coeur,
its
polished
stone
glowing
white
like
a
resplendent
sanctuary.
Here
at
the
westernmost
tip
of
the
Denon
Wing,
the
north
south
thoroughfare
of
Place
du
Carrousel
ran
almost
flush
with
the
building
with
only
a
narrow
sidewalk
separating
it
from
the
Louvre's
outer
wall.
Far
below,
the
usual
caravan
of
the
city's
nighttime
delivery
trucks
sat
idling,
waiting
for
the
signals
to
change,
their
running
lights
seeming
to
twinkle
mockingly
up
at
Sophie.
"I
don't
know
what
to
say,"
Langdon
said,
coming
up
behind
her.
"Your
grandfather
is
obviously
trying
to
tell
us
something.
I'm
sorry
I'm
so
little
help."
Sophie
turned
from
the
window,
sensing
a
sincere
regret
in
Langdon's
deep
voice.
Even
with
all
the
trouble
around
him,
he
obviously
wanted
to
help
her.
The
teacher
in
him,
she
thought,
having
read
DCPJ's
workup
on
their
suspect.
This
was
an
academic
who
clearly
despised
not
understanding.
We
have
that
in
common,
she
thought.
As
a
codebreaker,
Sophie
made
her
living
extracting
meaning
from
seemingly
senseless
data.
Tonight,
her
best
guess
was
that
Robert
Langdon,
whether
he
knew
it
or
not,
possessed
information
that
she
desperately
needed.
Princesse
Sophie,
Find
Robert
Langdon.
How
much
clearer
could
her
grandfather's
message
be?
Sophie
needed
more
time
with
Langdon.
Time
to
think.
Time
to
sort
out
this
mystery
together.
Unfortunately,
time
was
running
out.
Gazing
up
at
Langdon,
Sophie
made
the
only
play
she
could
think
of.
"Bezu
Fache
will
be
taking
you
into
custody
at
any
minute.
I
can
get
you
out
of
this
museum.
But
we
need
to
act
now."
Langdon's
eyes
went
wide.
"You
want
me
to
run?"
"It's
the
smartest
thing
you
could
do.
If
you
let
Fache
take
you
into
custody
now,
you'll
spend
weeks
in
a
French
jail
while
DCPJ
and
the
U.S.
Embassy
fight
over
which
courts
try
your
case.
But
if
we
get
you
out
of
here,
and
make
it
to
your
embassy,
then
your
government
will
protect
your
rights
while
you
and
I
prove
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
murder.
Langdon
looked
not
even
vaguely
convinced.
"Forget
it!
Fache
has
armed
guards
on
every
single
exit!
Even
if
we
escape
without
being
shot,
running
away
only
makes
me
look
guilty.
You
need
to
tell
Fache
that
the
message
on
the
floor
was
for
you,
and
that
my
name
is
not
there
as
an
accusation.
"I
will
do
that,"
Sophie
said,
speaking
hurriedly,
"but
after
you're
safely
inside
the
U.S.
Embassy.
It's
only
about
a
mile
from
here,
and
my
car
is
parked
just
outside
the
museum.
Dealing
with
Fache
from
here
is
too
much
of
a
gamble.
Don't
you
see?
Fache
has
made
it
his
mission
tonight
to
prove
you
are
guilty.
The
only
reason
he
postponed
your
arrest
was
to
run
this
observance
in
hopes
you
did
something
