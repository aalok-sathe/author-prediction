art
in
this
building,
most
tourists
chose
an
abbreviated
experience
Langdon
referred
to
as
"Louvre
Lite"
a
full
sprint
through
the
museum
to
see
the
three
most
famous
objects:
the
Mona
Lisa,
Venus
de
Milo,
and
Winged
Victory.
Art
Buchwald
had
once
boasted
he'd
seen
all
three
masterpieces
in
five
minutes
and
fifty
six
seconds.
The
driver
pulled
out
a
handheld
walkie
talkie
and
spoke
in
rapid
fire
French.
"Monsieur
Langdon
est
arrive.
Deux
minutes.
An
indecipherable
confirmation
came
crackling
back.
The
agent
stowed
the
device,
turning
now
to
Langdon.
"You
will
meet
the
capitaine
at
the
main
entrance."
The
driver
ignored
the
signs
prohibiting
auto
traffic
on
the
plaza,
revved
the
engine,
and
gunned
the
Citroen
up
over
the
curb.
The
Louvre's
main
entrance
was
visible
now,
rising
boldly
in
the
distance,
encircled
by
seven
triangular
pools
from
which
spouted
illuminated
fountains.
La
Pyramide.
The
new
entrance
to
the
Paris
Louvre
had
become
almost
as
famous
as
the
museum
itself.
The
controversial,
neomodern
glass
pyramid
designed
by
Chinese
born
American
architect
I.
M.
Pei
still
evoked
scorn
from
traditionalists
who
felt
it
destroyed
the
dignity
of
the
Renaissance
courtyard.
Goethe
had
described
architecture
as
frozen
music,
and
Pei's
critics
described
this
pyramid
as
fingernails
on
a
chalkboard.
Progressive
admirers,
though,
hailed
Pei's
seventy
one
foot
tall
transparent
pyramid
as
a
dazzling
synergy
of
ancient
structure
and
modern
method
a
symbolic
link
between
the
old
and
new
helping
usher
the
Louvre
into
the
next
millennium.
"Do
you
like
our
pyramid?"
the
agent
asked.
Langdon
frowned.
The
French,
it
seemed,
loved
to
ask
Americans
this.
It
was
a
loaded
question,
of
course.
Admitting
you
liked
the
pyramid
made
you
a
tasteless
American,
and
expressing
dislike
was
an
insult
to
the
French.
"Mitterrand
was
a
bold
man,"
Langdon
replied,
splitting
the
difference.
The
late
French
president
who
had
commissioned
the
pyramid
was
said
to
have
suffered
from
a
"Pharaoh
complex."
Singlehandedly
responsible
for
filling
Paris
with
Egyptian
obelisks,
art,
and
artifacts.
Francois
Mitterrand
had
an
affinity
for
Egyptian
culture
that
was
so
all
consuming
that
the
French
still
referred
to
him
as
the
Sphinx.
"What
is
the
captain's
name?"
Langdon
asked,
changing
topics.
"Bezu
Fache,"
the
driver
said,
approaching
the
pyramid's
main
entrance.
"We
call
him
le
Taureau.
Langdon
glanced
over
at
him,
wondering
if
every
Frenchman
had
a
mysterious
animal
epithet.
"You
call
your
captain
the
Bull?"
The
man
arched
his
eyebrows.
"Your
French
is
better
than
you
admit,
Monsieur
Langdon."
My
French
stinks,
Langdon
thought,
but
my
zodiac
iconography
is
pretty
good.
Taurus
was
always
the
bull.
Astrology
was
a
symbolic
constant
all
over
the
world.
The
agent
pulled
the
car
to
a
stop
and
pointed
between
two
fountains
to
a
large
door
in
the
side
of
the
pyramid.
"There
is
the
entrance.
Good
luck,
monsieur."
"You're
not
coming?"
"My
orders
are
to
leave
you
here.
I
have
other
business
to
attend
to."
Langdon
heaved
a
sigh
and
climbed
out.
It's
your
circus.
The
agent
revved
his
engine
and
sped
