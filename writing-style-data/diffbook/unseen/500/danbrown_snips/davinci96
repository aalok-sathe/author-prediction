turned
and
flexed
his
buttocks.
Beside
him,
a
gorgeous
blond
woman
lifted
her
miniskirt
to
reveal
that
she
was
not,
in
fact,
a
woman.
Heaven
help
me!
Langdon
turned
his
gaze
back
inside
the
cab
and
took
a
deep
breath.
"Tell
me
about
the
Priory
of
Sion,"
Sophie
said.
Langdon
nodded,
unable
to
imagine
a
less
congruous
a
backdrop
for
the
legend
he
was
about
to
tell.
He
wondered
where
to
begin.
The
brotherhood's
history
spanned
more
than
a
millennium
an
astonishing
chronicle
of
secrets,
blackmail,
betrayal,
and
even
brutal
torture
at
the
hands
of
an
angry
Pope.
"The
Priory
of
Sion,"
he
began,
"was
founded
in
Jerusalem
in
1099
by
a
French
king
named
Godefroi
de
Bouillon,
immediately
after
he
had
conquered
the
city."
Sophie
nodded,
her
eyes
riveted
on
him.
"King
Godefroi
was
allegedly
the
possessor
of
a
powerful
secret
a
secret
that
had
been
in
his
family
since
the
time
of
Christ.
Fearing
his
secret
might
be
lost
when
he
died,
he
founded
a
secret
brotherhood
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
charged
them
with
protecting
his
secret
by
quietly
passing
it
on
from
generation
to
generation.
During
their
years
in
Jerusalem,
the
Priory
learned
of
a
stash
of
hidden
documents
buried
beneath
the
ruins
of
Herod's
temple,
which
had
been
built
atop
the
earlier
ruins
of
Solomon's
Temple.
These
documents,
they
believed,
corroborated
Godefroi's
powerful
secret
and
were
so
explosive
in
nature
that
the
Church
would
stop
at
nothing
to
get
them."
Sophie
looked
uncertain.
"The
Priory
vowed
that
no
matter
how
long
it
took,
these
documents
must
be
recovered
from
the
rubble
beneath
the
temple
and
protected
forever,
so
the
truth
would
never
die.
In
order
to
retrieve
the
documents
from
within
the
ruins,
the
Priory
created
a
military
arm
a
group
of
nine
knights
called
the
Order
of
the
Poor
Knights
of
Christ
and
the
Temple
of
Solomon."
Langdon
paused.
"More
commonly
known
as
the
Knights
Templar."
Sophie
glanced
up
with
a
surprised
look
of
recognition.
Langdon
had
lectured
often
enough
on
the
Knights
Templar
to
know
that
almost
everyone
on
earth
had
heard
of
them,
at
least
abstractedly.
For
academics,
the
Templars'
history
was
a
precarious
world
where
fact,
lore,
and
misinformation
had
become
so
intertwined
that
extracting
a
pristine
truth
was
almost
impossible.
Nowadays,
Langdon
hesitated
even
to
mention
the
Knights
Templar
while
lecturing
because
it
invariably
led
to
a
barrage
of
convoluted
inquiries
into
assorted
conspiracy
theories.
Sophie
already
looked
troubled.
"You're
saying
the
Knights
Templar
were
founded
by
the
Priory
of
Sion
to
retrieve
a
collection
of
secret
documents?
I
thought
the
Templars
were
created
to
protect
the
Holy
Land."
"A
common
misconception.
The
idea
of
protection
of
pilgrims
was
the
guise
under
which
the
Templars
ran
their
mission.
Their
true
goal
in
the
Holy
Land
was
to
retrieve
the
documents
from
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
temple."
"And
did
they
find
them?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Nobody
knows
for
sure,
but
the
one
thing
on
which
all
academics
agree
is
this:
The
