"No

Gettum
said.
"Not

giants

London."
Langdon
and
Sophie
sat
patiently
in
front
of
the
screen
and
waited
through
two
more
dubious
returns.
When
the
computer
pinged
again,
though,
the
offering
was
unexpected.
DIE
OPERN
VON
RICHARD
WAGNER
"The
operas
of
Wagner?"
Sophie
asked.
Gettum
peeked
back
in
the
doorway,
holding
a
packet
of
instant
coffee.
"That
seems
like
a
strange
match.
Was
Wagner
a
knight?"
"No,"
Langdon
said,
feeling
a
sudden
intrigue.
"But
he
was
a
well
known
Freemason."
Along
with
Mozart,
Beethoven,
Shakespeare,
Gershwin,
Houdini,
and
Disney.
Volumes
had
been
written
about
the
ties
between
the
Masons
and
the
Knights
Templar,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
and
the
Holy
Grail.
"I
want
to
look
at
this
one.
How
do
I
see
the
full
text?"
"You
don't
want
the
full
text,"
Gettum
called.
"Click
on
the
hypertext
title.
The
computer
will
display
your
keyword
hits
along
with
mono
prelogs
and
triple
postlogs
for
context."
Langdon
had
no
idea
what
she
had
just
said,
but
he
clicked
anyway.
A
new
window
popped
up.

"Wrong

Langdon
said,
disappointed.
Even
so,
he
was
amazed
by
the
system's
ease
of
use.
The
keywords
with
context
were
enough
to
remind
him
that
Wagner's
opera
Parsifal
was
a
tribute
to
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ,
told
through
the
story
of
a
young
knight
on
a
quest
for
truth.
"Just
be
patient,"
Gettum
urged.
"It's
a

game.
Let
the
machine
run."
Over
the
next
few
minutes,
the
computer
returned
several
more
Grail
references,
including
a
text
about
troubadours
France's
famous
wandering
minstrels.
Langdon
knew
it
was
no
coincidence
that
the
word
minstrel
and
minister
shared
an
etymological
root.
The
troubadours
were
the
traveling
servants
or
"ministers"
of
the
Church
of
Mary
Magdalene,
using
music
to
disseminate
the
story
of
the
sacred
feminine
among
the
common
folk.
To
this
day,
the
troubadours
sang
songs
extolling
the
virtues
of
"our
Lady"
a
mysterious
and
beautiful
woman
to
whom
they
pledged
themselves
forever.
Eagerly,
he
checked
the
hypertext
but
found
nothing.
The
computer
pinged
again.

Langdon
said
to
Sophie.
"Some
of
our
keywords
have
the

names
as

cards."
He
reached
for
the
mouse
to
click
on
a
hyperlink.
"I'm
not

Sophie,

Sophie
eyed
him,
looking
incredulous.
"I

"That's
the
