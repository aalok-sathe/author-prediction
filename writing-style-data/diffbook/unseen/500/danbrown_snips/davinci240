power
of
the
devil
himself.
The
man
roared
in
his
ear.
SILAS,
NO!
Silas
spun
and
fired.
Their
eyes
met.
Silas
was
already
screaming
in
horror
as
Bishop
Aringarosa
fell.
More
than
three
thousand
people
are
entombed
or
enshrined
within
Westminster
Abbey.
The
colossal
stone
interior
burgeons
with
the
remains
of
kings,
statesmen,
scientists,
poets,
and
musicians.
Their
tombs,
packed
into
every
last
niche
and
alcove,
range
in
grandeur
from
the
most
regal
of
mausoleums
that
of
Queen
Elizabeth
I,
whose
canopied
sarcophagus
inhabits
its
own
private,
apsidal
chapel
down
to
the
most
modest
etched
floor
tiles
whose
inscriptions
have
worn
away
with
centuries
of
foot
traffic,
leaving
it
to
one's
imagination
whose
relics
might
lie
below
the
tile
in
the
undercroft.
Designed
in
the
style
of
the
great
cathedrals
of
Amiens,
Chartres,
and
Canterbury,
Westminster
Abbey
is
considered
neither
cathedral
nor
parish
church.
It
bears
the
classification
of
royal
peculiar,
subject
only
to
the
Sovereign.
Since
hosting
the
coronation
of
William
the
Conqueror
on
Christmas
Day
in
1066,
the
dazzling
sanctuary
has
witnessed
an
endless
procession
of
royal
ceremonies
and
affairs
of
state
from
the
canonization
of
Edward
the
Confessor,
to
the
marriage
of
Prince
Andrew
and
Sarah
Ferguson,
to
the
funerals
of
Henry
V,
Queen
Elizabeth
I,
and
Lady
Diana.
Even
so,
Robert
Langdon
currently
felt
no
interest
in
any
of
the
abbey's
ancient
history,
save
one
event
the
funeral
of
the
British
knight
Sir
Isaac
Newton.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
Hurrying
through
the
grand
portico
on
the
north
transept,
Langdon
and
Sophie
were
met
by
guards
who
politely
ushered
them
through
the
abbey's
newest
addition
a
large
walk
through
metal
detector
now
present
in
most
historic
buildings
in
London.
They
both
passed
through
without
setting
off
the
alarm
and
continued
to
the
abbey
entrance.
Stepping
across
the
threshold
into
Westminster
Abbey,
Langdon
felt
the
outside
world
evaporate
with
a
sudden
hush.
No
rumble
of
traffic.
No
hiss
of
rain.
Just
a
deafening
silence,
which
seemed
to
reverberate
back
and
forth
as
if
the
building
were
whispering
to
itself.
Langdon's
and
Sophie's
eyes,
like
those
of
almost
every
visitor,
shifted
immediately
skyward,
where
the
abbey's
great
abyss
seemed
to
explode
overhead.
Gray
stone
columns
ascended
like
redwoods
into
the
shadows,
arching
gracefully
over
dizzying
expanses,
and
then
shooting
back
down
to
the
stone
floor.
Before
them,
the
wide
alley
of
the
north
transept
stretched
out
like
a
deep
canyon,
flanked
by
sheer
cliffs
of
stained
glass.
On
sunny
days,
the
abbey
floor
was
a
prismatic
patchwork
of
light.
Today,
the
rain
and
darkness
gave
this
massive
hollow
a
wraithlike
aura
more
like
that
of
the
crypt
it
truly
was.
"It's
practically
empty,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
felt
disappointed.
He
had
hoped
for
a
lot
more
people.
A
more
public
place.
Their
earlier
experience
in
the
deserted
Temple
Church
was
not
one
Langdon
wanted
to
repeat.
He
had
been
anticipating
a
certain
feeling
of
security
in
the
popular
tourist
destination,
but
Langdon's
recollections
of
bustling
throngs
