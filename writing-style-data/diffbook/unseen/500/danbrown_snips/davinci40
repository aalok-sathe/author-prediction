accurate
within
two
feet
anywhere
on
the
globe.
They
have
you
on
an
electronic
leash.
The
agent
who
picked
you
up
at
the
hotel
slipped
it
inside
your
pocket
before
you
left
your
room."
Langdon
flashed
back
to
the
hotel
room
his
quick
shower,
getting
dressed,
the
DCPJ
agent
politely
holding
out
Langdon'
s
tweed
coat
as
they
left
the
room.
It's
cool
outside,
Mr.
Langdon,
the
agent
had
said.
Spring
in
Paris
is
not
all
your
song
boasts.
Langdon
had
thanked
him
and
donned
the
jacket.
Sophie's
olive
gaze
was
keen.
"I
didn't
tell
you
about
the
tracking
dot
earlier
because
I
didn't
want
you
checking
your
pocket
in
front
of
Fache.
He
can't
know
you've
found
it."
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
"They
tagged
you
with
GPS
because
they
thought
you
might
run."
She
paused.
"In
fact,
they
hoped
you
would
run;
it
would
make
their
case
stronger."
"Why
would
I
run!"
Langdon
demanded.
"I'm
innocent!"
"Fache
feels
otherwise."
Angrily,
Langdon
stalked
toward
the
trash
receptacle
to
dispose
of
the
tracking
dot.
"No!"
Sophie
grabbed
his
arm
and
stopped
him.
"Leave
it
in
your
pocket.
If
you
throw
it
out,
the
signal
will
stop
moving,
and
they'll
know
you
found
the
dot.
The
only
reason
Fache
left
you
alone
is
because
he
can
monitor
where
you
are.
If
he
thinks
you've
discovered
what
he's
doing"
Sophie
did
not
finish
the
thought.
Instead,
she
pried
the
metallic
disk
from
Langdon'
s
hand
and
slid
it
back
into
the
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat.
"The
dot
stays
with
you.
At
least
for
the
moment."
Langdon
felt
lost.
"How
the
hell
could
Fache
actually
believe
I
killed
Jacques
Sauniere!"
"He
has
some
fairly
persuasive
reasons
to
suspect
you."
Sophie's
expression
was
grim.
"There
is
a
piece
of
evidence
here
that
you
have
not
yet
seen.
Fache
has
kept
it
carefully
hidden
from
you."
Langdon
could
only
stare.
"Do
you
recall
the
three
lines
of
text
that
Sauniere
wrote
on
the
floor?"
Langdon
nodded.
The
numbers
and
words
were
imprinted
on
Langdon's
mind.
Sophie's
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
now.
"Unfortunately,
what
you
saw
was
not
the
entire
message.
There
was
a
fourth
line
that
Fache
photographed
and
then
wiped
clean
before
you
arrived.
Although
Langdon
knew
the
soluble
ink
of
a
watermark
stylus
could
easily
be
wiped
away,
he
could
not
imagine
why
Fache
would
erase
evidence.
"The
last
line
of
the
message,"
Sophie
said,
"was
something
Fache
did
not
want
you
to
know
about."
She
paused.
"At
least
not
until
he
was
done
with
you."
Sophie
produced
a
computer
printout
of
a
photo
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
began
unfolding
it.
"Fache
uploaded
images
of
the
crime
scene
to
the
Cryptology
Department
earlier
tonight
in
hopes
we
could
figure
out
what
Sauniere's
message
was
trying
to
say.
This
is
a
photo
of
the
complete
message."
She
handed
the
page
to
Langdon.
Bewildered,
Langdon
looked
at
the
image.
The
close
up
photo
revealed
the
glowing
message
on
the
parquet
