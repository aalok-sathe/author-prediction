moved
smoothly.
She
aligned
the
disks
such
that
her
chosen
letters
lined
up
between
the
cryptex's
two
brass
alignment
arrows
on
either
end
of
the
cylinder.
The
dials
now
spelled
a
five
letter
word
that
Sophie
knew
was
absurdly
obvious.
G

L.
Gently,
she
held
the
two
ends
of
the
cylinder
and
pulled,
applying
pressure
slowly.
The
cryptex
didn't
budge.
She
heard
the
vinegar
inside
gurgle
and
stopped
pulling.
Then
she
tried
again.

Again,
no

Nothing.
The
cryptex
remained
locked
solid.
Frowning,
she
replaced
it
in
the
rosewood
box
and
closed
the
lid.
Looking
outside
at
Langdon,
Sophie
felt
grateful
he
was
with
her
tonight.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Her
grandfather's
rationale
for
including
him
was
now
clear.
Sophie
was
not
equipped
to
understand
her
grandfather's
intentions,
and
so
he
had
assigned
Robert
Langdon
as
her
guide.
A
tutor
to
oversee
her
education.
Unfortunately
for
Langdon,
he
had
turned
out
to
be
far
more
than
a
tutor
tonight.
He
had
become
the
target
of
Bezu
Fache
and
some
unseen
force
intent
on
possessing
the
Holy
Grail.
Whatever
the
Grail
turns
out
to
be.
Sophie
wondered
if
finding
out
was
worth
her
life.
As
the
armored
truck
accelerated
again,
Langdon
was
pleased
how
much
more
smoothly
it
drove.
"Do
you
know
how
to
get
to
Versailles?"
Sophie
eyed
him.
"Sightseeing?"
"No,
I
have
a
plan.
There's
a
religious
historian
I
know
who
lives
near
Versailles.
I
can't
remember
exactly
where,
but
we
can
look
it
up.
I've
been
to
his
estate
a
few
times.
His
name
is
Leigh
Teabing.
He's
a
former
British
Royal
Historian."
"And
he
lives
in
Paris?"
"Teabing's
life
passion
is
the
Grail.
When
whisperings
of
the
Priory
keystone
surfaced
about
fifteen
years
ago,
he
moved
to
France
to
search
churches
in
hopes
of
finding
it.
He's
written
some
books
on
the
keystone
and
the
Grail.
He
may
be
able
to
help
us
figure
out
how
to
open
it
and
what
to
do
with
it."
Sophie's
eyes
were
wary.
"Can
you
trust
him?"
"Trust
him
to
what?
Not
steal
the
information?"
"And
not
to
turn
us
in."
"I
don't
intend
to
tell
him
we're
wanted
by
the
police.
I'm
hoping
he'll
take
us
in
until
we
can
sort
all
this
out."
"Robert,
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
every
television
in
France
is
probably
getting
ready
to
broadcast
our
pictures?
Bezu
Fache
always
uses
the
media
to
his
advantage.
He'll
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
move
around
without
being
recognized."
Terrific,
Langdon
thought.
My
French
TV
debut
will
be
on
"Paris
's
Most
Wanted.
"
At
least
Jonas
Faukman
would
be
pleased;
every
time
Langdon
made
the
news,
his
book
sales
jumped.
"Is
this
man
a
good
enough
friend?"
Sophie
asked.
Langdon
doubted
Teabing
was
someone
who
watched
television,
especially
at
this
hour,
but
still
the
question
deserved
consideration.
Instinct
told
Langdon
that
Teabing
would
be
totally
trustworthy.
An
ideal
safe
harbor.
