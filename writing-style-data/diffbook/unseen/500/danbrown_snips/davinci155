etes
vous?"
the
woman
said.
"Your
name?"
Aringarosa
was
uncertain
if
he
should
reveal
it.
The
French
Judicial
Police
?
"Your
name,
monsieur?"
the
woman
pressed.
"Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa."
"Un
moment.
"
There
was
a
click
on
the
line.
After
a
long
wait,
another
man
came
on,
his
tone
gruff
and
concerned.
"Bishop,
I
am
glad
I
finally
reached
you.
You
and
I
have
much
to
discuss."
Sangreal
Sang
Real
San
Great.
Royal
Blood
Holy
Grail.
It
was
all
intertwined.
The
Holy
Grail
is
Mary
Magdalene
the
mother
of
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ.
Sophie
felt
a
new
wave
of
disorientation
as
she
stood
in
the
silence
of
the
ballroom
and
stared
at
Robert
Langdon.
The
more
pieces
Langdon
and
Teabing
laid
on
the
table
tonight,
the
more
unpredictable
this
puzzle
became.
"As
you
can
see,
my
dear,"
Teabing
said,
hobbling
toward
a
bookshelf,
"Leonardo
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
been
trying
to
tell
the
world
the
truth
about
the
Holy
Grail.
The
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ
has
been
chronicled
in
exhaustive
detail
by
scores
of
historians."
He
ran
a
finger
down
a
row
of
several
dozen
books.
Sophie
tilted
her
head
and
scanned
the
list
of
titles:
THE
TEMPLAR
REVELATION:
Secret
Guardians
of
the
True
Identity
of
Christ
THE
WOMAN
WITH
THE
ALABASTER
JAR:
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
Holy
Grail
THE
GODDESS
IN
THE
GOSPELS
Reclaiming
the
Sacred
Feminine
"Here
is
perhaps
the
best
known
tome,"
Teabing
said,
pulling
a
tattered
hardcover
from
the
stack
and
handing
it
to
her.
The
cover
read:
HOLY
BLOOD,
HOLY
GRAIL
The
Acclaimed
International
Bestseller
Sophie
glanced
up.
"An
international
bestseller?
I've
never
heard
of
it."
"You
were
young.
This
caused
quite
a
stir
back
in
the
nineteen
eighties.
To
my
taste,
the
authors
made
some
dubious
leaps
of
faith
in
their
analysis,
but
their
fundamental
premise
is
sound,
and
to
their
credit,
they
finally
brought
the
idea
of
Christ's
bloodline
into
the
mainstream."
"What
was
the
Church's
reaction
to
the
book?"
"Outrage,
of
course.
But
that
was
to
be
expected.
After
all,
this
was
a
secret
the
Vatican
had
tried
to
bury
in
the
fourth
century.
That's
part
of
what
the
Crusades
were
about.
Gathering
and
destroying
information.
The
threat
Mary
Magdalene
posed
to
the
men
of
the
early
Church
was
potentially
ruinous.
Not
only
was
she
the
woman
to
whom
Jesus
had
assigned
the
task
of
founding
the
Church,
but
she
also
had
physical
proof
that
the
Church's
newly
proclaimed
deity
had
spawned
a
mortal
bloodline.
The
Church,
in
order
to
defend
itself
against
the
Magdalene's
power,
perpetuated
her
image
as
a
whore
and
buried
evidence
of
Christ's
marriage
to
her,
thereby
defusing
any
potential
claims
that
Christ
had
a
surviving
bloodline
and
was
a
mortal
prophet."
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
who
nodded.
"Sophie,
the
historical
evidence
supporting
this
is
substantial."
"I
admit,"
Teabing
said,
"the
assertions
are
dire,
but
you
must
understand
the
Church's
powerful
motivations
to
conduct
such
a
cover
up.
They
could
never
have
