to
stop
him."
"Who
exactly
is
he?"
But
the
concierge
was
gone.
Almost
immediately,
a
heavy
fist
pounded
on
Langdon's
door.
Uncertain,
Langdon
slid
off
the
bed,
feeling
his
toes
sink
deep
into
the
savonniere
carpet.
He
donned
the
hotel
bathrobe
and
moved
toward
the
door.
"Who
is
it?"
"Mr.
Langdon?
I
need
to
speak
with
you."
The
man's
English
was
accented
a
sharp,
authoritative
bark.
"My
name
is
Lieutenant
Jerome
Collet.
Direction
Centrale
Police
Judiciaire."
Langdon
paused.
The
Judicial
Police?
The
DCPJ
was
the
rough
equivalent
of
the
U.S.
FBI.
Leaving
the
security
chain
in
place,
Langdon
opened
the
door
a
few
inches.
The
face
staring
back
at
him
was
thin
and
washed
out.
The
man
was
exceptionally
lean,
dressed
in
an
official
looking
blue
uniform.
"May
I
come
in?"
the
agent
asked.
Langdon
hesitated,
feeling
uncertain
as
the
stranger's
sallow
eyes
studied
him.
"What
is
this
all
about?"
"My
capitaine
requires
your
expertise
in
a
private
matter."
"Now?"
Langdon
managed.
"It's
after
midnight."
"Am
I
correct
that
you
were
scheduled
to
meet
with
the
curator
of
the
Louvre
this
evening?"
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
uneasiness.
He
and
the
revered
curator
Jacques
Sauniere
had
been
slated
to
meet
for
drinks
after
Langdon's
lecture
tonight,
but
Sauniere
had
never
shown
up.
"Yes.
How
did
you
know
that?"
"We
found
your
name
in
his
daily
planner."
"I
trust
nothing
is
wrong?"
The
agent
gave
a
dire
sigh
and
slid
a
Polaroid
snapshot
through
the
narrow
opening
in
the
door.
When
Langdon
saw
the
photo,
his
entire
body
went
rigid.
"This
photo
was
taken
less
than
an
hour
ago.
Inside
the
Louvre."
As
Langdon
stared
at
the
bizarre
image,
his
initial
revulsion
and
shock
gave
way
to
a
sudden
upwelling
of
anger.
"Who
would
do
this!"
"We
had
hoped
that
you
might
help
us
answer
that
very
question,
considering
your
knowledge
in
symbology
and
your
plans
to
meet
with
him."
Langdon
stared
at
the
picture,
his
horror
now
laced
with
fear.
The
image
was
gruesome
and
profoundly
strange,
bringing
with
it
an
unsettling
sense
of
deja
vu.
A
little
over
a
year
ago,
Langdon
had
received
a
photograph
of
a
corpse
and
a
similar
request
for
help.
Twenty
four
hours
later,
he
had
almost
lost
his
life
inside
Vatican
City.
This
photo
was
entirely
different,
and
yet
something
about
the
scenario
felt
disquietingly
familiar.
The
agent
checked
his
watch.
"My
capitaine
is
waiting,
sir."
Langdon
barely
heard
him.
His
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
the
picture.
"This
symbol
here,
and
the
way
his
body
is
so
oddly"
"Positioned?"
the
agent
offered.
Langdon
nodded,
feeling
a
chill
as
he
looked
up.
"I
can't
imagine
who
would
do
this
to
someone."
The
agent
looked
grim.
"You
don't
understand,
Mr.
Langdon.
What
you
see
in
this
photograph"
He
paused.
"Monsieur
Sauniere
did
that
to
himself."
One
mile
away,
the
hulking
albino
named
Silas
limped
through
the
front
gate
of
the
luxurious
brownstone
residence
on
Rue
La
Bruyere.
The
spiked
cilice
belt
that
he
