Dei
monk
had
come
to
Saint
Sulpice
for
another
purpose.
A
secret
purpose.
You
are
not
the
only
one
with
secrets,
she
thought.
Sister
Sandrine
Bieil
was
more
than
the
keeper
of
this
church.
She
was
a
sentry.
And
tonight,
the
ancient
wheels
had
been
set
in
motion.
The
arrival
of
this
stranger
at
the
base
of
the
obelisk
was
a
signal
from
the
brotherhood.
It
was
a
silent
call
of
distress.
The
U.S.
Embassy
in
Paris
is
a
compact
complex
on
Avenue
Gabriel,
just
north
of
the
Champs
Elysees.
The
three
acre
compound
is
considered
U.S.
soil,
meaning
all
those
who
stand
on
it
are
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
protections
as
they
would
encounter
standing
in
the
United
States.
The
embassy's
night
operator
was
reading
Time
magazine's
International
Edition
when
the
sound
of
her
phone
interrupted.
"U.S.
Embassy,"
she
answered.
"Good
evening."
The
caller
spoke
English
accented
with
French.
"I
need
some
assistance."
Despite
the
politeness
of
the
man's
words,
his
tone
sounded
gruff
and
official.
"I
was
told
you
had
a
phone
message
for
me
on
your
automated
system.
The
name
is
Langdon.
Unfortunately,
I
have
forgotten
my
three
digit
access
code.
If
you
could
help
me,
I
would
be
most
grateful."
The
operator
paused,
confused.
"I'm
sorry,
sir.
Your
message
must
be
quite
old.
That
system
was
removed
two
years
ago
for
security
precautions.
Moreover,
all
the
access
codes
were
five
digit.
Who
told
you
we
had
a
message
for
you?"
"You
have
no
automated
phone
system?"
"No,
sir.
Any
message
for
you
would
be
handwritten
in
our
services
department.
What
was
your
name
again?"
But
the
man
had
hung
up.
Bezu
Fache
felt
dumbstruck
as
he
paced
the
banks
of
the
Seine.
He
was
certain
he
had
seen
Langdon
dial
a
local
number,
enter
a
three
digit
code,
and
then
listen
to
a
recording.
But
if
Langdon
didn't
phone
the
embassy,
then
who
the
hell
did
he
call?
It
was
at
that
moment,
eyeing
his
cellular
phone,
that
Fache
realized
the
answers
were
in
the
palm
of
his
hand.
Langdon
used
my
phone
to
place
that
call.
Keying
into
the
cell
phone's
menu,
Fache
pulled
up
the
list
of
recently
dialed
numbers
and
found
the
call
Langdon
had
placed.
A
Paris
exchange,
followed
by
the
three
digit
code
454.
Redialing
the
phone
number,
Fache
waited
as
the
line
began
ringing.
Finally
a
woman's
voice
answered.
"Bonjour,
vous
etes
bien
chez
Sophie
Neveu,
"
the
recording
announced.
"Je
suis
absente
pour
le
moment,
mais"
Fache's
blood
was
boiling
as
he
typed
the
numbers
4
5
4.
Despite
her
monumental
reputation,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
a
mere
thirty
one
inches
by
twenty
one
inches
smaller
even
than
the
posters
of
her
sold
in
the
Louvre
gift
shop.
She
hung
on
the
northwest
wall
of
the
Salle
des
Etats
behind
a
two
inch
thick
pane
of
protective
Plexiglas.
Painted
on
a
poplar
wood
panel,
her
ethereal,
mist
filled
atmosphere
was
attributed
to
Da
Vinci's
mastery
of
the
