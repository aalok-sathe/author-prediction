will
call
you
later."
He
hung
up.
For
several
seconds,
Collet
held
the
receiver.
Then
it
dawned
on
him.
knew
I
recognized
that
voice!
The
revelation
made
him
gasp.
The
armored
car
driver.
With
the
fake
Rolex.
Collet
now
understood
why
the
banker
had
hung
up
so
quickly.
Vernet
had
remembered
the
name
Lieutenant
Collet
the
officer
he
blatantly
lied
to
earlier
tonight.
Collet
pondered
the
implications
of
this
bizarre
development.
Vernet
is
involved.
Instinctively,
he
knew
he
should
call
Fache.
Emotionally,
he
knew
this
lucky
break
was
going
to
be
his
moment
to
shine.
He
immediately
called
Interpol
and
requested
every
shred
of
information
they
could
find
on
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
and
its
president,
Andre
Vernet.
"Seat
belts,
please,"
Teabing's
pilot
announced
as
the
Hawker
731
descended
into
a
gloomy
morning
drizzle.
"We'll
be
landing
in
five
minutes."
Teabing
felt
a
joyous
sense
of
homecoming
when
he
saw
the
misty
hills
of
Kent
spreading
wide
beneath
the
descending
plane.
England
was
less
than
an
hour
from
Paris,
and
yet
a
world
away.
This
morning,
the
damp,
spring
green
of
his
homeland
looked
particularly
welcoming.
My
time
in
France
is
over.
I
am
returning
to
England
victorious.
The
keystone
has
been
found.
The
question
remained,
of
course,
as
to
where
the
keystone
would
ultimately
lead.
Somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom.
Where
exactly,
Teabing
had
no
idea,
but
he
was
already
tasting
the
glory.
As
Langdon
and
Sophie
looked
on,
Teabing
got
up
and
went
to
the
far
side
of
the
cabin,
then
slid
aside
a
wall
panel
to
reveal
a
discreetly
hidden
wall
safe.
He
dialed
in
the
combination,
opened
the
safe,
and
extracted
two
passports.
"Documentation
for
Rimy
and
myself."
He
then
removed
a
thick
stack
of
fifty
pound
notes.
"And
documentation
for
you
two."
Sophie
looked
leery.
"A
bribe?"
"Creative
diplomacy.
Executive
airfields
make
certain
allowances.
A
British
customs
official
will
greet
us
at
my
hangar
and
ask
to
board
the
plane.
Rather
than
permitting
him
to
come
on,
I'll
tell
him
I'm
traveling
with
a
French
celebrity
who
prefers
that
nobody
knows
she
is
in
England
press
considerations,
you
know
and
I'll
offer
the
official
this
generous
tip
as
gratitude
for
his
discretion."
Langdon
looked
amazed.
"And
the
official
will
accept?"
"Not
from
anyone,
they
won't,
but
these
people
all
know
me.
I'm
not
an
arms
dealer,
for
heaven's
sake.
I
was
knighted."
Teabing
smiled.
"Membership
has
its
privileges."
Remy
approached
up
the
aisle
now,
the
Heckler
Koch
pistol
cradled
in
his
hand.
"Sir,
my
agenda?"
Teabing
glanced
at
his
servant.
"I'm
going
to
have
you
stay
onboard
with
our
guest
until
we
return.
We
can't
very
well
drag
him
all
over
London
with
us."
Sophie
looked
wary.
"Leigh,
I
was
serious
about
the
French
police
finding
your
plane
before
we
return.
Teabing
laughed.
"Yes,
imagine
their
surprise
if
they
board
and
find
Remy."
Sophie
looked
surprised
by
his
cavalier
attitude.
"Leigh,
you
transported
a
bound
hostage
across
international
borders.
This
is
serious."
"So
are
