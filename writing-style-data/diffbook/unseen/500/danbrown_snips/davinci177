I
expect
you
will
join
me
there
permanently.
I'm
planning
to
buy
a
splendid
villa
in
Devonshire,
and
we'll
have
all
your
things
shipped
up
immediately.
An
adventure,
Remy.
I
say,
an
adventure!"
Langdon
had
to
smile.
As
Teabing
railed
on
about
his
plans
for
a
triumphant
return
to
Britain,
Langdon
felt
himself
caught
up
in
the
man's
infectious
enthusiasm.
Gazing
absently
out
the
window,
Langdon
watched
the
woods
passing
by,
ghostly
pale
in
the
yellow
blush
of
the
fog
lights.
The
side
mirror
was
tipped
inward,
brushed
askew
by
branches,
and
Langdon
saw
the
reflection
of
Sophie
sitting
quietly
in
the
back
seat.
He
watched
her
for
a
long
while
and
felt
an
unexpected
upwelling
of
contentment.
Despite
his
troubles
tonight,
Langdon
was
thankful
to
have
landed
in
such
good
company.
After
several
minutes,
as
if
suddenly
sensing
his
eyes
on
her,
Sophie
leaned
forward
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders,
giving
him
a
quick
rub.
"You
okay?"
"Yeah,"
Langdon
said.
"Somehow."
Sophie
sat
back
in
her
seat,
and
Langdon
saw
a
quiet
smile
cross
her
lips.
He
realized
that
he
too
was
now
grinning.
Wedged
in
the
back
of
the
Range
Rover,
Silas
could
barely
breathe.
His
arms
were
wrenched
backward
and
heavily
lashed
to
his
ankles
with
kitchen
twine
and
duct
tape.
Every
bump
in
the
road
sent
pain
shooting
through
his
twisted
shoulders.
At
least
his
captors
had
removed
the
cilice.
Unable
to
inhale
through
the
strip
of
tape
over
his
mouth,
he
could
only
breathe
through
his
nostrils,
which
were
slowly
clogging
up
due
to
the
dusty
rear
cargo
area
into
which
he
had
been
crammed.
He
began
coughing.
"I
think
he's
choking,"
the
French
driver
said,
sounding
concerned.
The
British
man
who
had
struck
Silas
with
his
crutch
now
turned
and
peered
over
the
seat,
frowning
coldly
at
Silas.
"Fortunately
for
you,
we
British
judge
man's
civility
not
by
his
compassion
for
his
friends,
but
by
his
compassion
for
his
enemies."
The
Brit
reached
down
and
grabbed
the
duct
tape
on
Silas's
mouth.
In
one
fast
motion,
he
tore
it
off.
Silas
felt
as
if
his
lips
had
just
caught
fire,
but
the
air
pouring
into
his
lungs
was
sent
from
God.
"Whom
do
you
work
for?"
the
British
man
demanded.
"I
do
the
work
of
God,"
Silas
spat
back
through
the
pain
in
his
jaw
where
the
woman
had
kicked
him.
"You
belong
to
Opus
Dei,"
the
man
said.
It
was
not
a
question.
"You
know
nothing
of
who
I
am."
"Why
does
Opus
Dei
want
the
keystone?"
Silas
had
no
intention
of
answering.
The
keystone
was
the
link
to
the
Holy
Grail,
and
the
Holy
Grail
was
the
key
to
protecting
the
faith.
do
the
work
of
God.
The
Way
is
in
peril.
Now,
in
the
Range
Rover,
struggling
against
his
bonds,
Silas
feared
he
had
failed
the
Teacher
and
the
bishop
forever.
He
had
no
way
even
to
contact
them
and
tell
them
the
terrible
turn
of
events.
My
captors
