decided
to
stop
trying
to
keep
ahead
of
Sophie
Neveu.
Using
his
Visa
card,
he
purchased
two
coach
tickets
to
Lyon
and
handed
them
to
Sophie.
Sophie
guided
him
out
toward
the
tracks,
where
a
familiar
tone
chimed
overhead
and
a
P.A.
announcer
gave
the
final
boarding
call
for
Lyon.
Sixteen
separate
tracks
spread
out
before
them.
In
the
distance
to
the
right,
at
quay
three,
the
train
to
Lyon
was
belching
and
wheezing
in
preparation
for
departure,
but
Sophie
already
had
her
arm
through
Langdon's
and
was
guiding
him
in
the
exact
opposite
direction.
They
hurried
through
a
side
lobby,
past
an
all
night
cafe,
and
finally
out
a
side
door
onto
a
quiet
street
on
the
west
side
of
the
station.
A
lone
taxi
sat
idling
by
the
doorway.
The
driver
saw
Sophie
and
flicked
his
lights.
Sophie
jumped
in
the
back
seat.
Langdon
got
in
after
her.
As
the
taxi
pulled
away
from
station,
Sophie
took
out
their
newly
purchased
train
tickets
and
tore
them
up.
Langdon
sighed.
Seventy
dollars
well
spent.
It
was
not
until
their
taxi
had
settled
into
a
monotonous
northbound
hum
on
Rue
de
Clichy
that
Langdon
felt
they'd
actually
escaped.
Out
the
window
to
his
right,
he
could
see
Montmartre
and
the
beautiful
dome
of
Sacre
Coeur.
The
image
was
interrupted
by
the
flash
of
police
lights
sailing
past
them
in
the
opposite
direction.
Langdon
and
Sophie
ducked
down
as
the
sirens
faded.
Sophie
had
told
the
cab
driver
simply
to
head
out
of
the
city,
and
from
her
firmly
set
jaw,
Langdon
sensed
she
was
trying
to
figure
out
their
next
move.
Langdon
examined
the
cruciform
key
again,
holding
it
to
the
window,
bringing
it
close
to
his
eyes
in
an
effort
to
find
any
markings
on
it
that
might
indicate
where
the
key
had
been
made.
In
the
intermittent
glow
of
passing
streetlights,
he
saw
no
markings
except
the
Priory
seal.
"It
doesn't
make
sense,"
he
finally
said.
"Which
part?"
"That
your
grandfather
would
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
give
you
a
key
that
you
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
with."
"I
agree."
"Are
you
sure
he
didn't
write
anything
else
on
the
back
of
the
painting?"
"I
searched
the
whole
area.
This
is
all
there
was.
This
key,
wedged
behind
the
painting.
I
saw
the
Priory
seal,
stuck
the
key
in
my
pocket,
then
we
left."
Langdon
frowned,
peering
now
at
the
blunt
end
of
the
triangular
shaft.
Nothing.
Squinting,
he
brought
the
key
close
to
his
eyes
and
examined
the
rim
of
the
head.
Nothing
there
either.
"I
think
this
key
was
cleaned
recently."
"Why?"
"It
smells
like
rubbing
alcohol."
She
turned.
"I'm
sorry?"
"It
smells
like
somebody
polished
it
with
a
cleaner."
Langdon
held
the
key
to
his
nose
and
sniffed.
"It's
stronger
on
the
other
side."
He
flipped
it
over.
"Yes,
it's
alcohol
based,
like
it's
been
buffed
with
a
cleaner
or
"
Langdon
stopped.
"What?"
He
angled
the
key
to
the
light
and
looked
