of
the
sacred
feminine.
Physical
union
with
the
female
remained
the
sole
means
through
which
man
could
become
spiritually
complete
and
ultimately
achieve
gnosis
knowledge
of
the
divine.
Since
the
days
of
Isis,
sex
rites
had
been
considered
man's
only
bridge
from
earth
to
heaven.
"By
communing
with
woman,"
Langdon
said,
"man
could
achieve
a
climactic
instant
when
his
mind
went
totally
blank
and
he
could
see
God.
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"Orgasm
as
prayer?"
Langdon
gave
a
noncommittal
shrug,
although
Sophie
was
essentially
correct.
Physiologically
speaking,
the
male
climax
was
accompanied
by
a
split
second
entirely
devoid
of
thought.
A
brief
mental
vacuum.
A
moment
of
clarity
during
which
God
could
be
glimpsed.
Meditation
gurus
achieved
similar
states
of
thoughtlessness
without
sex
and
often
described
Nirvana
as
a
never
ending
spiritual
orgasm.
"Sophie,"
Langdon
said
quietly,
"it's
important
to
remember
that
the
ancients'
view
of
sex
was
entirely
opposite
from
ours
today.
Sex
begot
new
life
the
ultimate
miracle
and
miracles
could
be
performed
only
by
a
god.
The
ability
of
the
woman
to
produce
life
from
her
womb
made
her
sacred.
A
god.
Intercourse
was
the
revered
union
of
the
two
halves
of
the
human
spirit
male
and
female
through
which
the
male
could
find
spiritual
wholeness
and
communion
with
God.
What
you
saw
was
not
about
sex,
it
was
about
spirituality.
The
Hieros
Gamos
ritual
is
not
a
perversion.
It's
a
deeply
sacrosanct
ceremony."
His
words
seemed
to
strike
a
nerve.
Sophie
had
been
remarkably
poised
all
evening,
but
now,
for
the
first
time,
Langdon
saw
the
aura
of
composure
beginning
to
crack.
Tears
materialized
in
her
eyes
again,
and
she
dabbed
them
away
with
her
sleeve.
He
gave
her
a
moment.
Admittedly,
the
concept
of
sex
as
a
pathway
to
God
was
mind
boggling
at
first.
Langdon's
Jewish
students
always
looked
flabbergasted
when
he
first
told
them
that
the
early
Jewish
tradition
involved
ritualistic
sex.
In
the
Temple,
no
less.
Early
Jews
believed
that
the
Holy
of
Holies
in
Solomon's
Temple
housed
not
only
God
but
also
His
powerful
female
equal,
Shekinah.
Men
seeking
spiritual
wholeness
came
to
the
Temple
to
visit
priestesses
or
hierodules
with
whom
they
made
love
and
experienced
the
divine
through
physical
union.
The
Jewish
tetragrammaton
YHWH
the
sacred
name
of
God
in
fact
derived
from
Jehovah,
an
androgynous
physical
union
between
the
masculine
Jah
and
the
pre
Hebraic
name
for
Eve,
Havah.
"For
the
early
Church,"
Langdon
explained
in
a
soft
voice,
"mankind's
use
of
sex
to
commune
directly
with
God
posed
a
serious
threat
to
the
Catholic
power
base.
It
left
the
Church
out
of
the
loop,
undermining
their
selfproclaimed
status
as
the
sole
conduit
to
God.
For
obvious
reasons,
they
worked
hard
to
demonize
sex
and
recast
it
as
a
disgusting
and
sinful
act.
Other
major
religions
did
the
same."
Sophie
was
silent,
but
Langdon
sensed
she
was
starting
to
understand
her
grandfather
better.
Ironically,
Langdon
had
made
this
same
point
in
a
class
lecture
earlier
this
semester.
"Is
it
